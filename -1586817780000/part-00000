It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter.

There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=October 8, 2019|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to Los Angeles and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden's robotic shell, as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden's mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars' core, to which there is no immediate access. The Slayer then travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars, which he uses to access Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deags inducted him into the Sentinels, while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy's knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill-fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, [[Heaven|Urdak]], to survive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|title=Doom Eternal--What The Hell Are The Story And Ending About?|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=April 9, 2020|website=Gamespot|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|archive-date=April 11, 2020|access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and halts the Icon's awakening ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon's heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. When the Icon's awakening destroys the dimensional barrier, the Demons immediately break their pact with the Maykrs and proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell's invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics.

There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=October 8, 2019|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to Los Angeles and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden's robotic shell, as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden's mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars' core, to which there is no immediate access. The Slayer then travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars, which he uses to access Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deags inducted him into the Sentinels, while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy's knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill-fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, [[Heaven|Urdak]], to survive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|title=Doom Eternal--What The Hell Are The Story And Ending About?|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=April 9, 2020|website=Gamespot|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-what-the-hell-are-the-story-and-endin/1100-6475232/|archive-date=April 11, 2020|access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and halts the Icon's awakening ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon's heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. When the Icon's awakening destroys the dimensional barrier, the Demons immediately break their pact with the Maykrs and proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell's invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

Upon entering, the front door closes and is locked, presumably by Emily, since she appears for an instant in front of the door. The player must then survive the night from 11 pm until 6 am. Each hour of the game is a new level. The player can explore the house freely looking for clues as to why he is trapped inside. Various notes and recordings containing story elements are spread out in different rooms. At a fixed amount of time, the hour changes and new gameplay elements are added in the form of a doll or Emily. The player must then figure out how to interact with each doll and Emily herself in order to survive the hours (6 minutes). If a doll or Emily attacks the player, in the form of a jump scare, then the player loses and the game is over. The player will be restarted at the beginning of the last hour.

A pizza is ordered to the house using an online pizza delivery service by what is presumably a deceased and ghostly girl named Emily Withers. A pizza man comes to the house to fulfill the order.

A whiteboard in the kitchen tells the opposite of what he has to do to survive (although it sometimes has comments or facts that aren't lies).

She considered the dolls her friends, but her parents would like to take them away from her. The recordings left behind seem to be from Maggie Withers, Emily's mother, and were recorded to help with her own depression. The recordings explain that Emily was acting strangely ever since they moved here, presumably because she didn't like her new home. Emily was showing signs of erratic and violent behavior, which led her to harm other children at school and kill the puppy that they bought her. Because of this, her parents decided to keep her at home and lock her in the basement. During this time, Emily found the dolls, and even stranger occurrences started to happen. The dolls appeared in different places around the house without anyone moving them, and Emily had opened up a giant hole in the floor of her room that would be impossible for a small child to do. Emily was found lifeless one day in the basement, convincing the parents to move from the house.\n\nNews audio that plays on a staticky television explains that a couple was killed a month ago while they were preparing to move. This is presumably Emily's parents, and someone had killed them before they were able to move, which could possibly be Emily or one of her dolls. There are hints to a possible subplot. The phrases \"Join Us\" and \"We Are One\" can be seen written on a few notes, on the bottom of a crashed Windows computer and heard at the end of a recording in the basement. There is also a strange figure depicted behind what looks like Emily and her dolls on the back of one of the notes.\n\nWhen the pizza man finally escapes, the police come back to check the house. A news report states that the pizza delivery man is now under psychiatric evaluation, but the dolls matching his description have been recovered.\n\n===Emily Wants to Play Too===\n''Emily Wants To Play Too'' begins at 6 am in the protagonist's apartment, after having a large party. The protagonist has to get to work at Timmy Thom's Fast Sandwiches by 4:00 pm. At this point, the protagonist decides to rest before that time. While the protagonist sleeps, he seems to have the same nightmare he has been having in his previous slumbers where he encounters Emily and her dolls. When he officially awakens, he takes a shower and washes dishes before going to deliver a sandwich order to a research facility known as Central Evidence. Arriving there at 6 pm, he gets locked in and sees Chester doing some sort of ritual before the door to the room closes on him and later sees Kiki bringing Max Steelwell to life with a similar ritual. He must first discover key cards to gain access to four area levels and survive until 7 am against Emily and her dolls before he can escape, in which they will start a fire in the building to destroy the evidence and confiscate all the fire extinguishers found throughout the building, forcing him to escape. Whiteboards in the building provide hints to help the player; however, some are lies used to trick the player.\n\nThe game introduces three new dolls: Weasl, Max Steelwell (who is actually a man disguised as a store mannequin), and Greta as well as Emily and the three original dolls. The newspaper articles found within the building explain the backstories of Emily and the six dolls, implying that they are possessed by an evil entity (presumed to be the spirit of a puppet master named Vult Ludere, who is the original owner of Kiki, Mr. Tatters, and Chester). \n\nThere are two alternate endings in the game. The first one can be achieved during the 6 AM area at the player's apartment. If the player turns off the light, he will start to get scared. If he stays like this over a minute, noises will be heard in the dark suggesting that the dolls are gathering around him. Finally, the local journal will reports that the protagonist died because he tripped in his apartment and suffered from a fatal injury. The second one can be achieved when he comes inside the Central Evidence for the first time where he sees Chester doing some magic and out of fear, he decides to run away. He is believed by the police to be responsible for the fire that destroyed Central Evidence. Because he didn't deliver the order, he had lost his job. \n\nA file revealing the accident at the Central Evidence and the dolls is then shown and the man reading the story is hinted to be the pizza delivery man from the first game, who suggests that he should \"go back to that house\". \n\nAs the credits roll, Emily and her dolls are seen facing a tall figure (presumably the entity mentioned in the newspapers), saying that it won't let her out anymore and now \"they are one\".\n\n==Development==\nThe developer, Shawn Hitchcock, announced that he will be releasing ''Emily Wants To Play'' on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, creating a VR update and a sequel titled Emily Wants to Play Too.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Emily Wants To Play|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/416590/announcements/detail/583592261458280234|website = steamcommunity.com|accessdate = May 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.emilywantstoplay.com}}\n\n[[Category:2015 video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Psychological horror games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:HTC Vive games]]\n[[Category:Oculus Rift games]]\n[[Category:Unreal Engine games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Emily Wants To Play\n| image = Emily_Wants_to_Play_Cover_Art.jpg\n| caption =\n| developer = Shawn Hitchcock\n| publisher = SKH Apps\n| engine = [[Unreal Engine 4]]\n| platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]]<br />[[OS X]]<br />[[PlayStation 4]]<br />[[Xbox One]]<br />[[Oculus Rift]]<br />[[HTC Vive]]<br />[[iOS]]<br />[[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n| released = {{Unbulleted list|'''Microsoft Windows''', '''OS X''', '''Oculus Rift''', '''HTC Vive'''|December 10, 2015|'''iOS''', '''Android'''|January 31, 2016|'''PlayStation 4'''|August 9, 2016|'''Xbox One'''|September 9, 2016}}\n| genre = [[Survival horror]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Emily Wants To Play''''' is a [[survival horror]] video game created by [[indie developer]] Shawn Hitchcock.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Emily Wants to Play Has Been Released|url = http://www.justadventure.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3208|website = www.justadventure.com |accessdate = Jun 16, 2016}}</ref> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]] on December 10, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Emily Wants To Play on Steam|url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/416590/|website = steampowered.com |accessdate = May 26, 2016}}</ref> It was then released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on January 31, 2016, [[PlayStation 4]] on August 9, 2016, and [[Xbox One]] on September 9, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Emily Wants To Play|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/416590/announcements/detail/58913131657411128|website = steamcommunity.com|accessdate = June 4, 2016}}</ref> ''Emily Wants to Play'' was adapted to play in virtual reality by using the [[HTC Vive]] or [[Oculus Rift]] on August 25, 2016.

Upon entering, the front door closes and is locked, presumably by Emily, since she appears for an instant in front of the door. The player must then survive the night from 11 pm until 6 am. Each hour of the game is a new level. The player can explore the house freely looking for clues as to why he is trapped inside. Various notes and recordings containing story elements are spread out in different rooms. At a fixed amount of time, the hour changes and new gameplay elements are added in the form of a doll or Emily. The player must then figure out how to interact with each doll and Emily herself in order to survive the hours (6 minutes). If a doll or Emily attacks the player, in the form of a jump scare, then the player loses and the game is over. The player will be restarted at the beginning of the last hour. There are various clues on notes and on a whiteboard in the kitchen that help the player to learn how to handle a doll when it appears (although what's written on the whiteboard are usually lies meant to trick the player).

After the [[World War II]] he has made it his life's work to research the Holocaust and publicize facts about it.\n\n==Biography==\n===Concentration camps===\nIn 1939 after the outbreak of [[World War II]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] for [[Anti-fascism|anti Nazi activity]] in [[\u0160pilberk Castle|\u0160pilberk prison]], an old [[castle]] on the hilltop in [[Brno]], Southern [[Moravia]].  Later during the war he was transferred and managed to survive throughout five-and-a-half years in other concentration camps: [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]], and 28 months in [[Auschwitz]], from 1942 to 1945.  In Auschwitz \u2013 Birkenau he worked with Ota Kraus and other Jewish prisoners in a workshop.  Thanks to his position in the maintenance squad he had access to most of the Birkenau camps, so he could help fellow prisoners, act like a messenger, carry medicines and letters conceled in the hollow handles of his tools and even meet his wife and son in what came to be called the \u201cCzech family camp\u201d.  They arrived on September 1943 on a transport of 5,007 people from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghetto-theresienstadt.de/pages/k/kulkae.htm |title=Theresienstadt Lexikon: Erich Kulka |publisher=Ghetto-theresienstadt.de |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>  It was different from other transports: there was no selection and gassing, families were allowed to stay together, they were not shaved and they received old civilian clothes and shoes rather than striped prison grabs and wooden clogs and were not sent outside to perform hard [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]].  They could write to friends left behind in order to reassure them that conditions at the work camp Birkenau, near Neu-Berun, were bearable.  This was the real reason for their lenient treatment which ended after 6 month by brutal liquidation of the family camp.\n\nDuring the evacuation of Auschwitz in January 1945, Kulka managed to survive a three-day [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]], and to escape while their train passed in [[Czechoslovakia]] together with his twelve-year-old son, [[Otto Dov Kulka]] (1933).  After a series of risky episodes, in constant fear of betrayal, they ended up sheltering with the Fr\u00fddl family in the mountain village of [[Lipt\u00e1l]].\n\nErich Kulka's father, Siegbert, had been taken to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] as early as 1941, and perished there.  Other transports from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] to Auschwitz were selected and gassed in the regular way \u2014 thus perished Kulka's mother, Malv\u00edna, and two sisters Elisabeth and Josephine; his brothers Otto and Albert survived.  His wife, Elly, was transferred to [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]] and died during an escape attempt.\n\n===Post-war===\nIn 1956, he donated photographs to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=358&Itemid=8 |title=Auschwitz-Birkenau - Waiting for Death in the Birch Forest in Birkenau |publisher=En.auschwitz.org |date=2003-03-04 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>  After the war, he wrote with his friend in prison Ota Kraus the book ''[[The Death Factory]]'', now considered a classic documentary book about Auschwitz.  It has been translated into many languages and about a million copies have been sold worldwide.  A special chapter in the book is devoted to the history and demise of the \"family camp\" in Birkenau, describing the murder of thousands of [[Czech Jews]].  The book was published in seven editions in Czech and translated into many other languages.\n\nAnother book, ''Night and Fog'' (co-authored with Ota Kraus), is a study of the economic system of Nazi concentration camps and [[genocide]] motives.\n\nHis book ''Judges, Prosecutors, Advocates'' deals with the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials|Frankfurt Trials]] of Auschwitz war criminals.  In 1964, Erich and his son, [[Otto Dov Kulka]], testified in these trials in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].  His son Dov became a professor of modern Jewish history, at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].  Other scientific and literary publications from this period covered the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].  The historical novella ''Escape from Auschwitz'', based on the true escape story of a Czech prisoner, {{ill|Siegfried Lederer|cs|V\u00edt\u011bzslav Lederer}} from the \"family camp\" in Birkenau, and his attempts to warn the Jews in Terezin (Theresienstadt) [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]], and the international community about the extermination of Jews by the Nazis.\n\n===Migration to Israel===\nAfter the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion to Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, Kulka immigrated to Israel.  He continued his research activities at the Hebrew University and at the [[Yad Vashem]] institute resulting in a first-time-in-history study relating to the significant participation of Jews from the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in World War II for the liberation of Czechoslovakia: \u201c''Jews in Svoboda\u2019s army in the Soviet Union''\u201d and \u201c''Jews in the Czechoslovak Army in the West''\u201d.\n\nIn Israel, Kulka was among the most active members of the \u201cAssociation of Immigrants from Czechoslovakia\" and in the \u201cIsrael-Czechoslovakia Friendship League\".  In 1977 he was among the founders of the [[Museum of Tolerance]] of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].  Other projects included the establishment of the World Association of Auschwitz Survivors and publishing of the journal 'The Voice of Auschwitz Survivors', in [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[German language|German]].  In 1982, he was a contributor for the [[BBC]] program, ''The Gathering''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/holocaust/5103.shtml |title=Archive - WWII: Witnessing the Holocaust - The Gathering |publisher=BBC |date=1982-09-15 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Post-communist Czech Republic===\nAfter the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]] in Czechoslovakia, Kulka devoted himself to the renewal of Jewish life at the Jewish community in [[Prague]], participation in international conferences and delivering lectures in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.  During this period, he also published new and expanded Czech editions of his previous books and his other publications.  A monument in his hometown Vset\u00edn was built on his own initiative, on the site of the synagogue that was burned by the Nazis.  Another project he initiated is erecting stone tablets on the wall at the entrance to the Vset\u00edn Jewish cemetery, with engraved names of the holocaust victims from his home town and the surroundings.  Until the last year of his life he was actively involved in the rehabilitation of political relations, scientific and cultural relations between Israel and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn recognition of his life's work Erich Kulka was awarded in 1989 an honorary doctorate by the [[Spertus College of Judaica]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nIn 1993, he founded at the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem a fund that bears his name, which provides scholarships for outstanding doctoral research in the history of Czech Jews and the Holocaust. Most of the awardees are lecturers in Israeli universities, in Harvard and in [[Moscow]].\n\nHis scientific library is maintained at Beit Terezin in [[Givat Haim (Ihud)|Givat Haim]] [[kibutz]] and his personal archive is in the central archives of [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem.\n\nIn November 2004 a statue was created in his memory (portrait sculpture by the Czech artist Josef Vajce) in the Theresienstadt Ghetto Museum in the Czech Republic.  In 2011, his 100th birthday, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]], published a file of articles in his memory (Czech, English, and Hebrew) by the name: \"Erich Kulka 1911 to 1995, Life as a Mission in Memory of Those Who Did Not Return\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/acultvkc2.php?mesic=9&rok=11 |title=Evening programmes in the Education & Culture Centre |publisher=Jewishmuseum.cz |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512004455/http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/acultvkc2.php?mesic=9&rok=11 |archivedate=2012-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Books & publications==\n* ''We Dead Accuse!''

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' praised the album for its use of live instrumentation and the lyrical delivery of both Jonny 5 and Brer Rabbit, concluding with, \"The versatility of the Flobots sound makes them very hard to pin down, but it also makes for an entertaining musical journey that doesn't get bogged down by their politics or a preachy didactic presentation.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries also complimented the band for having the ambition to tackle various political messages while backed with a live orchestra, saying that \"Good points are made with skill and fine wordplay, the guitars and drums crunch along driving home the message with head-bobbing grooves, and the album opens up with the marvelous \"Handlebars,\" a carefully crafted, slowly building tale of the ego run wild via some beautiful muted trumpet.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> James Greene, Jr. of ''[[PopMatters]]'' criticized the album for failing to recapture what [[Rage Against the Machine]] brought before and for being preachy in its political messages, saying that \"At the end of the day, Flobots and their sophomore effort can be summed up by the album\u2019s third track, \"Same Thing\". As the chorus demonstrates, they\u2019re just saying the same things over again, giving us the same revolutionary slogans anti-establishment forces have been shouting in the face of 'The Man' for years: \"We want money for healthcare and public welfare / free [[Mumia Abu-Jamal|Mumia]] and [[Leonard Peltier]]!\"\"<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/flobots-fight-with-tools/|title=Flobots: Fight With Tools|last=Greene Jr.|first=James|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|date=June 10, 2008|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Flobots\n\n| title1 = There's a War Going On for Your Mind\n| length1 = 1:22\n\n| title2 = Mayday!!!\n| length2 = 4:36\n\n| title3 = Same Thing\n| length3 = 3:29\n\n| title4 = Stand Up\n| length4 = 4:38\n\n| title5 = Fight with Tools\n| length5 = 4:51\n\n| title6 = [[Handlebars (song)|Handlebars]]\n| length6 = 3:27\n\n| title7 = Never Had It\n| length7 = 5:07\n\n| title8 = Combat\n| length8 = 2:05\n\n| title9 = The Rhythm Method (Move!)\n| length9 = 3:52\n\n| title10 = [[Anne Braden]]\n| length10 = 4:21\n\n| title11 = We Are Winning\n| length11 = 3:22\n\n| title12 = [[Rise (Flobots song)|Rise]]\n| length12 = 4:10\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = UK bonus track\n\n| title13 = Iraq\n| length13 = 3:31\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nAdapted credits from the ''Fight with Tools'' booklet.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Fight with Tools|others=Flobots|year=2008|publisher=Universal Republic|type=booklet}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Flobots\n* 0.
