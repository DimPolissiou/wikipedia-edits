In addition, she was indirectly inspired by one of Bryan Konietzko's sisters. Korra was also designed to be an inversion of [[Aang]], the title character of the preceding story ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. Instead of the young, spiritual Aang, Korra is a more physical character who has trouble grasping the spiritual side of being the Avatar while being able to already bend three elements at the age of four. In contrast, Aang takes a while to master each of the elements, but connects with the spirit world instantaneously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/06/22/the-legend-of-korra-creators-answer-your-questions/| title='The Legend of Korra' Creators Answer Your Questions|date=2012-06-22|accessdate=2012-06-25}}</ref> Korra's name was settled long after her character was imagined.

As development of the last two seasons went on and Korra and Asami's friendship progressed, \"the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for [the creators],\" and so the show started hinting at the possibility of such a relationship. In the end, Konietzko and DiMartino chose to openly depict Korra and Asami's relationship in the series finale because they didn't want to regret not doing so after the series ended. While still having limits on what could be shown, Nickelodeon was supportive of the relationship when approached.<ref name=\"Konietzko\"/>\n\n=== Design ===\n [[File:Korra (Season 4) appearance.jpg|thumb|right|Korra as she appears in Book 4.]]\nBefore drawing the character, Konietzko and DiMartino discussed her athleticism and physicality which factored into the earliest illustrations of Korra.

After her defeat of Amon, she underwent an outfit change, gaining an asymmetrical top and sleeves.\n\nKorra for the first three seasons is depicted with long hair that is usually kept in a ponytail, though she has it down on several occasions such as when attending festivities, while entering the Avatar State by the Red Lotus and during her battle with Zaheer shortly afterward.<ref name=\"Venom of the Red Lotus\">{{cite episode|title=Venom of the Red Lotus|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=313|airdate=2014-08-22|season=4|number=2|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=313|transcript=Transcript for 313 - Venom of the Red Lotus|credits=Director: Mei Zwyer; Writer: Joshua Hamilton & Tim Hedrick|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> Korra is so rarely seen with her hair down that DiMartino wrote that whenever the character had her hair down, \"you know something bad has happened.\"<ref name=DiMartino106>{{cite book|first=Michael Dante|last=DiMartino|title=''The Legend of Korra\u2014The Art of the Animated Series, Book One: Air''|pages=106|year=2013|isbn=978-1616551681|publisher=Dark Horse Books}}</ref> She maintains the hairstyle for the next three years as she recovers until shortly after regaining her mobility, at which point she cuts it.<ref name=\"Korra Alone\">{{cite episode|title= Korra Alone|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=402|airdate=2014-10-10|season=4|number=2|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=402|transcript=Transcript for 402 - Korra Alone|credits=Director: Ian Graham; Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref> The hairstyle change was revealed in September 2014 by Konietzko, who wrote that the character was returning to her roots by sporting a bob cut similar to the one she was given by Dos Santos in his original concept for her, Konietzko adding that the alteration was carrying on a tradition in the ''Avatar'' franchise to have hairstyle changes over the course of a series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/97302394302/korranation-korra-is-heading-to-new-york-comic|title=Korra's new hairstyle|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=Tumblr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hypable.com/check-out-korras-new-look-in-the-legend-of-korra-season-4/|title='The Legend of Korra' season 4: Korra's New Look|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=Hypable|first=Michal|last=Schick}}</ref> Korra's initial clothing in the fourth season is purposely designed to mirror that of her Water Tribe attire in the previous seasons, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants, DiMartino finding it paramount that it resemble her prior clothing due to the duration for which she wore it.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legend of Korra: The Art of the Animated Series Book Four: Balance|page=26|year=2015|first1=Michae Dante|last1=DiMartino|first2=Bryan|last2=Konietzko|publisher=Dark Horse Books|isbn= 978-1616556877}}</ref> Korra gains another outfit midway through the fourth season.

For instance, Avatar Roku - a firebender - took longer to learn waterbending and Aang - an airbender - took longer to learn earthbending. The waterbender Korra, on the other hand, had little difficulty with firebending but had considerable trouble with airbending, a situation noted to be spiritual and not elemental.\n\nHer best friend and animal guide is a polar bear-dog named Naga, whose strength helps Korra out of many dangerous situations. Although wild polar bear dogs were originally feared and hunted by Water Tribes, Korra is the first person to ever tame one.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Legend of Korra: Welcome to Republic City|url=http://www.nick.com/games/legend-of-korra-welcome-to-republic-city.html|work=The Legend of Korra|publisher=Nickelodeon|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> Korra is good friends with her pro-bending teammates, the brothers Mako (her [[Love interest|romantic interest]] in seasons 1 and 2) and Bolin. She also develops a strong friendship, and later romance,<ref name=dimartino-korrasami /> with Asami Sato, a wealthy industrialist. Korra has strong relationships with the family of her previous life: Having learned waterbending from Katara and then airbending from Tenzin, Tenzin's children Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo look up to her as an older sister, and Kya and Bumi regard her as a friend. Korra is generally on good terms with her own parents, but has little contact with her uncle or cousins, whom she considers weird (and her father considers dangerous). Korra is unusual amongst her past lives in that she is technically royalty: her father Tonraq was in line to be the chief of the Northern Water Tribe before being banished and relocating to the South.\n\nKorra's character develops and matures during episodes 11 through 12 of the first season when she is confronted with detachment from her main three bending skills, leaving her only with airbending, which she had unlocked to save Mako from Amon. Later, she connects to her spiritual self through Aang. Once the connection to her Avatar predecessors is established, Aang is able to bestow energybending upon Korra (as well as her main three bending skills lost earlier). Although Korra is able to bend all four elements, while being capable of entering the Avatar State, Korra is still in the process of perfecting her airbending skills as well as having a true connection and understanding of her spiritual self to complete her training as a fully realized Avatar. Combined with the events of seasons 2 and 3 placing her in life and death situations, the former having her no longer able to contact her past lives for advice, Korra begins to suffer [[post traumatic stress]] by the events of ''Book Four: Balance'' while doubting her abilities as the Avatar to maintain balance after those she faced have each disrupted the order she was struggling to protect in massive ways. But ultimately, once able to let go of the pain she went through and realizing the significance to her past suffering, Korra returns to her usual self while becoming a more compassionate person from her ordeals.\n\n===Martial arts mastery===\n{{quote|\"I can't believe your sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl. She's tough as nails.\"|Lin Beifong (The Legend of Korra)|source=}}\nKorra has impeccable [[athleticism]] and [[acrobatics]], shown being capable of simultaneously lifting Tenzin and his children with relative ease. She has surprising speed that go along with her agility and reflexes, which make her a skilled combatant in and of themselves. Her physical strength and stamina makes her capable of swimming across large bodies of water for days, or lift and throw significantly larger opponents. She can punch with enough force to break iron pipes or shatter large chunks of ice launched at her. Her dexterity and balance allows her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles and easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position. She is shown to be quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through tight spaces.\n\nThe series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting system.<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> Under the White Lotus' watchful protection, Korra was educated in all known academic fields, and trained by the best martial arts instructors. She was a fast-learner and considerable prodigy, seemingly ''driven''. Eventually, she sought out training from Aang's original teachers\u2014Katara, Zuko, Beifong\u2014but had great difficulty under the mentorship of Aangs son, Tenzin. Her predecessor lived with personal grief over the [[genocide]] of his people, and his personal failure as The Avatar in his inability to prevent the century long [[world war]] that destroyed millions of lives. He had vowed \"never-again\" would he allow himself to be unprepared in his subsequent live(s), and Korra unconsciously channels this oath in her insatiable quest to master every known [[martial arts]] that exists in her world, including:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Mixed martial arts]]\n*[[Jeet Kune Do]]\n*[[Aikido]]\n*[[Baguazhang]]\n*[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan]]\n*[[Yin Style Baguazhang]]\n*[[Hung Ga]]\n*[[Southern Praying Mantis]]\n*[[Southern Dragon Kung Fu]]\n*[[Changquan]]\n*[[Xing Yi Quan]]\n*[[Wing Chun]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Bending the elements===\n{{main|Aang#Bending the elements}}\n[[File:Korra firebending.png|right|thumb|300px|Korra firebending.]]\nAs the Avatar, Korra is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire). Even as a young child, she was already a [[child prodigy]], able to bend them with ease since and displayed a level of proficiency that would have rivaled her predecessor, Avatar Aang. At the start of the series, Korra is proficient in water, earth and fire, but struggles with airbending due to the difficulties of embracing her spiritual side. She utilizes all elements equally, but favors each one for different strategies: airbending mostly for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, such as gliding and evasive manoeuvres; waterbending for both defensive and offensive manoeuvres; earthbending for strong attacks; firebending for raw \"all-in\" aggression. She learned metalbending, being the first metalbending Avatar. She also tends to use firebending when she is angered or acts with hostility towards an opponent, as she demonstrated when threatening the Red Lotus when expressing outrage with Zaheer for apparently murdering her father.<ref name=\"Enter the Void\">{{cite episode|title=Venom of the Red Lotus|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=313|airdate=2014-08-22|season=3|number=12|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=312|transcript=Transcript for 312 - Enter the Void|credits=Director: Mei Zwyer; Writer: Ian Graham|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref>\n\n;Energybending\nAfter learning energybending following her defeat of Amon, she becomes capable of restoring bending to those who had lost their abilities thanks to his actions. Korra became the second known Avatar to possess the capability. Her duties as Avatar and her personal feelings towards people did come into play with the restoring power, as she did not grant bending abilities back to individuals with backgrounds in crime. She is able to use energybending to connect with her inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n;Spirituality\nAs the Avatar, Korra is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly reconnected with her spirituality, seeing visions and accessing various memories from her past lives. Korra is able to purify \"dark spirits\" by balancing the energy within them. Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, Korra lost her connection to her past lives by being temporarily separated from Raava, who was destroyed. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body after her battle with Zaheer, Korra lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Avatar State for three years.\n\n===The Avatar State===\nHer most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows her to access bending techniques she would not have learned during her own lifetime but throughout that of her predecessors. In addition, she also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling her to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight her head on. The form is activated by Korra being in a predicament that she will either not be able to combat with her current skills or when her life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Korra's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. Her weaknesses in the state is that she vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.\n\n==Reception==\nKorra has been widely praised as a realistic, well-developed and sophisticated character by critics and viewers alike. Her position as a female protagonist, unusual for American animation, caused Nickelodeon to originally suspend production on the series.<ref name=\"ArirangTV 2 May 2013\">{{cite news|title=The INNERview #61 - Yoo Jae-myung (\uc720\uc7ac\uba85), Animation director|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKhAHeLKsSY|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=[[ArirangTV]]|date=2 May 2013}}</ref> According to co-creator Bryan Koniezko, this was because the executives believed that \"girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls\".

In addition, she was indirectly inspired by one of Bryan Konietzko's sisters. Korra was also designed to be an inversion of [[Aang]], the title character of the preceding story ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. Instead of the young, spiritual Aang, Korra is a more physical character who has trouble grasping the spiritual side of being the Avatar while being able to already bend three elements at the age of four.

As development of the last two seasons went on and Korra and Asami's friendship progressed, \"the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for [the creators],\" and so the show started hinting at the possibility of such a relationship. In the end, Konietzko and DiMartino chose to openly depict Korra and Asami's relationship in the series finale because they didn't want to regret not doing so after the series ended.

The waterbender Korra, on the other hand, had little difficulty with firebending but had considerable trouble with airbending, a situation noted to be spiritual and not elemental.\n\nHer best friend and animal guide is a polar bear-dog named Naga, whose strength helps Korra out of many dangerous situations. Although wild polar bear dogs were originally feared and hunted by Water Tribes, Korra is the first person to ever tame one.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Legend of Korra: Welcome to Republic City|url=http://www.nick.com/games/legend-of-korra-welcome-to-republic-city.html|work=The Legend of Korra|publisher=Nickelodeon|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> Korra is good friends with her pro-bending teammates, the brothers Mako (her [[Love interest|romantic interest]] in seasons 1 and 2) and Bolin. She also develops a strong friendship, and later romance,<ref name=dimartino-korrasami /> with Asami Sato, a wealthy industrialist. Korra has strong relationships with the family of her previous life: Having learned waterbending from Katara and then airbending from Tenzin, Tenzin's children Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo look up to her as an older sister, and Kya and Bumi regard her as a friend. Korra is generally on good terms with her own parents, but has little contact with her uncle or cousins, whom she considers weird (and her father considers dangerous). Korra is unusual amongst her past lives in that she is technically royalty: her father Tonraq was in line to be the chief of the Northern Water Tribe before being banished and relocating to the South.\n\nKorra's character develops and matures during episodes 11 through 12 of the first season when she is confronted with detachment from her main three bending skills, leaving her only with airbending, which she had unlocked to save Mako from Amon. Later, she connects to her spiritual self through Aang. Once the connection to her Avatar predecessors is established, Aang is able to bestow energybending upon Korra (as well as her main three bending skills lost earlier). Although Korra is able to bend all four elements, while being capable of entering the Avatar State, Korra is still in the process of perfecting her airbending skills as well as having a true connection and understanding of her spiritual self to complete her training as a fully realized Avatar. Combined with the events of seasons 2 and 3 placing her in life and death situations, the former having her no longer able to contact her past lives for advice, Korra begins to suffer [[post traumatic stress]] by the events of ''Book Four: Balance'' while doubting her abilities as the Avatar to maintain balance after those she faced have each disrupted the order she was struggling to protect in massive ways. But ultimately, once able to let go of the pain she went through and realizing the significance to her past suffering, Korra returns to her usual self while becoming a more compassionate person from her ordeals.\n\n===Martial arts mastery===\n{{quote|\"I can't believe your sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl. She's tough as nails.\"|Lin Beifong (The Legend of Korra)|source=}}\nKorra has impeccable [[athleticism]] and [[acrobatics]], shown being capable of simultaneously lifting Tenzin and his children with relative ease. She has surprising speed that go along with her agility and reflexes, which make her a skilled combatant in and of themselves. Her physical strength and stamina makes her capable of swimming across large bodies of water for days, or lift and throw significantly larger opponents. She can punch with enough force to break iron pipes or shatter large chunks of ice launched at her. Her dexterity and balance allows her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles and easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position. She is shown to be quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through tight spaces.\n\nThe series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting system.<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> Under the White Lotus' watchful protection, Korra was educated in all known academic fields, and trained by the best martial arts instructors. She was a fast-learner and considerable prodigy, seemingly ''driven''. Eventually, she sought out training from Aang's original teachers\u2014Katara, Zuko, Beifong\u2014but had great difficulty under the mentorship of Aangs son, Tenzin. Her predecessor lived with personal grief over the [[genocide]] of his people, and his personal failure as The Avatar in his inability to prevent the century long [[world war]] that destroyed millions of lives. He had vowed \"never-again\" would he allow himself to be unprepared in his subsequent live(s), and Korra unconsciously channels this oath in her insatiable quest to master every known [[martial arts]] that exists in her world, including:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Mixed martial arts]]\n*[[Jeet Kune Do]]\n*[[Aikido]]\n*[[Baguazhang]]\n*[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan]]\n*[[Yin Style Baguazhang]]\n*[[Hung Ga]]\n*[[Southern Praying Mantis]]\n*[[Southern Dragon Kung Fu]]\n*[[Changquan]]\n*[[Xing Yi Quan]]\n*[[Wing Chun]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Bending the elements===\n{{main|Aang#Bending the elements}}\n[[File:Korra firebending.png|right|thumb|300px|Korra firebending.]]\nAs the Avatar, Korra is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire). Even as a young child, she was already a [[child prodigy]], able to bend them with ease since and displayed a level of proficiency that would have rivaled her predecessor, Avatar Aang. At the start of the series, Korra is proficient in water, earth and fire, but struggles with airbending due to the difficulties of embracing her spiritual side. She utilizes all elements equally, but favors each one for different strategies: airbending mostly for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, such as gliding and evasive manoeuvres; waterbending for both defensive and offensive manoeuvres; earthbending for strong attacks; firebending for raw \"all-in\" aggression. She learned metalbending, being the first metalbending Avatar. She also tends to use firebending when she is angered or acts with hostility towards an opponent, as she demonstrated when threatening the Red Lotus when expressing outrage with Zaheer for apparently murdering her father.<ref name=\"Enter the Void\">{{cite episode|title=Venom of the Red Lotus|url= http://korra.avatarspirit.net/episodes.php?num=313|airdate=2014-08-22|season=3|number=12|transcripturl=http://korra.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=312|transcript=Transcript for 312 - Enter the Void|credits=Director: Mei Zwyer; Writer: Ian Graham|series=The Legend of Korra|serieslink=The Legend of Korra|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref>\n\n;Energybending\nAfter learning energybending following her defeat of Amon, she becomes capable of restoring bending to those who had lost their abilities thanks to his actions. Korra became the second known Avatar to possess the capability. Her duties as Avatar and her personal feelings towards people did come into play with the restoring power, as she did not grant bending abilities back to individuals with backgrounds in crime. She is able to use energybending to connect with her inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n;Spirituality\nAs the Avatar, Korra is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly reconnected with her spirituality, seeing visions and accessing various memories from her past lives. Korra is able to purify \"dark spirits\" by balancing the energy within them. Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, Korra lost her connection to her past lives by being temporarily separated from Raava, who was destroyed. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body after her battle with Zaheer, Korra lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Avatar State for three years.\n\n===The Avatar State===\nHer most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows her to access bending techniques she would not have learned during her own lifetime but throughout that of her predecessors. In addition, she also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling her to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight her head on. The form is activated by Korra being in a predicament that she will either not be able to combat with her current skills or when her life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Korra's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. Her weaknesses in the state is that she vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.\n\n==Reception==\nKorra has been widely praised as a realistic, well-developed and sophisticated character by critics and viewers alike. Her position as a female protagonist, unusual for American animation, caused Nickelodeon to originally suspend production on the series.<ref name=\"ArirangTV 2 May 2013\">{{cite news|title=The INNERview #61 - Yoo Jae-myung (\uc720\uc7ac\uba85), Animation director|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKhAHeLKsSY|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=[[ArirangTV]]|date=2 May 2013}}</ref> According to co-creator Bryan Koniezko, this was because the executives believed that \"girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls\".

The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, \"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.\" Over 1.8 million schoolchildren took part in the trial.<ref name=Rose>Rose DR (2004). \"Fact Sheet\u2014Polio Vaccine Field Trial of 1954.\" March of Dimes Archives. 2004 02 11.</ref> News was made public of the vaccine's success on April 12, 1955, and Salk was hailed as a \"miracle worker\" and the day almost became a national holiday.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=No record of official movement for establishing national holiday.}} An immediate rush to vaccinate began around the world, with countries beginning polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine, including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium.\n\nSalk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a \"moral commitment\".<ref name=usa>Jacobs, Charlotte DeCroes.

Named after the founder of [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), it was, said Oshinsky, \"a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money\u2014and pedigree\u2014to attend a top private school.\" In high school \"he was known as a perfectionist ... who read everything he could lay his hands on,\" according to one of his fellow students.<ref name=Bookchin>Bookchin, Debbie, and Schumacher, Jim. ''The Virus and the Vaccine'', Macmillan (2004) {{ISBN|0-312-34272-1}}</ref> Students had to cram a four-year curriculum into just three years.

Getting in was tough, but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAt his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were \"barely second rate.\" There were no research laboratories; the library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there ... driven by their parents. ... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more [[Nobel Prize]] winners\u2014eight\u2014and PhD recipients than any other public college except the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a child, Salk did not show any interest in medicine or science in general. He said in an interview with the [[Academy of Achievement]],<ref>{{cite web|title= Jonas Salk Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=  https://achievement.org/achiever/jonas-salk-m-d/#interview}}</ref> \"As a child I was not interested in science. I was merely interested in things human, the human side of nature, if you like, and I continue to be interested in that.\"\n\n===Medical school===\n\nAfter City College, Salk enrolled in [[New York University]] to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as [[Walter Reed]], who helped conquer [[yellow fever]]. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools\u2014[[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]\u2014had rigid [[Jewish quota|quotas]] in place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501.

He later focused more of his studies on [[Microbiology|bacteriology]] which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients.<ref name=Bookchin/> \"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAccording to Salk: \"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Jonas Salk Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/jonas-salk-m-d/#interview}}</ref>\n\nConcerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize.

Francis had recently joined the faculty of the medical school after working for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], where he had discovered the type B [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]]. According to Bookchin, \"the two-month stint in Francis's lab was Salk's first introduction to the world of [[virology]]\u2014and he was hooked.\"<ref name=Bookchin/>{{rp|25}} After graduating from medical school, Salk began his residency at New York's prestigious<ref name=Oshinsky/> [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], where he again worked in Francis's laboratory.<ref name=Oshinsky/> Salk then worked at the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health]] with Francis, on an army-commissioned project in Michigan to develop an influenza vaccine.

After successful tests on laboratory animals, on July 2, 1952, assisted by the staff at the D.T. Watson Home for Crippled Children, Salk injected 43 children with his killed-virus vaccine. A few weeks later, Salk injected children at the Polk State School for the retarded and feeble-minded. In 1954 he tested the vaccine on about one million children, known as the polio pioneers.

As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity.

Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.\n\nSalk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, ''Man's Unfolding'', and ''The Survival of the Wisest''. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:\n\n<blockquote>I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. ... People think of [[biology]] in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. ... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.<ref name=NYT4-8-80/></blockquote>\n\nHis definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/openmind_ep1234 \"Man Evolving\"] video interview, 1985, 28 minutes</ref>\n\nJust prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled ''Millennium of the Mind''.\n\n==Personal life==\nThe day after his graduation from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. [[David Oshinsky]] writes that Donna's father, Elmer Lindsay, \"a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors.\" Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his \"rather pedestrian status\" by giving himself a middle name.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nThey had three children: Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan Salk.

Getting in was tough, but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAt his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were \"barely second rate.\" There were no research laboratories; the library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. \"What made the place special,\" he writes, \"was the student body that had fought so hard to get there ... driven by their parents. ... From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more [[Nobel Prize]] winners\u2014eight\u2014and PhD recipients than any other public college except the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].\" Salk entered CCNY at the age of 15, a \"common age for a freshman who had skipped multiple grades along the way.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a child, Salk did not show any interest in medicine or science in general.

I was merely interested in things human, the human side of nature, if you like, and I continue to be interested in that.\"\n\n===Medical school===\n\nAfter City College, Salk enrolled in [[New York University]] to study medicine. According to Oshinsky, NYU based its modest reputation on famous alumni, such as [[Walter Reed]], who helped conquer [[yellow fever]]. Tuition was \"comparatively low, better still, it did not discriminate against Jews, ... while most of the surrounding medical schools\u2014[[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]\u2014had rigid [[Jewish quota|quotas]] in place.\" Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501.

He later focused more of his studies on [[Microbiology|bacteriology]] which had replaced medicine as his primary interest. He said his desire was to help humankind in general rather than single patients.<ref name=Bookchin/> \"It was the laboratory work, in particular, that gave new direction to his life.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nAccording to Salk: \"My intention was to go to medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of my first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Jonas Salk Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/jonas-salk-m-d/#interview}}</ref>\n\nConcerning his last year of medical school Salk says: \"I had an opportunity to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize.

Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.\n\nSalk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, ''Man's Unfolding'', and ''The Survival of the Wisest''. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:\n\n<blockquote>I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. ... People think of [[biology]] in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. ... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.<ref name=NYT4-8-80/></blockquote>\n\nHis definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/openmind_ep1234 \"Man Evolving\"] video interview, 1985, 28 minutes</ref>\n\nJust prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled ''Millennium of the Mind''.\n\n==Personal life==\nThe day after his graduation from medical school in 1939, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. [[David Oshinsky]] writes that Donna's father, Elmer Lindsay, \"a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors.\" Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his \"rather pedestrian status\" by giving himself a middle name.\"<ref name=Oshinsky/>\n\nThey had three children: Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan Salk.

The flagship news program ''[[News Watch 9]]'' is also bilingual and also airs on NHK General TV and the international channels and NHK World Premium.
