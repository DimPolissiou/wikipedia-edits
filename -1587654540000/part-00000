It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L. Brown|accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> In 1840, the government bought extra land from the First Nations and laid out the settlement of Orillia. The population in 1846 was about 200. The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers. A grist mill could be found about a mile away.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Construction of the Monck Road began in 1866 and was completed in 1873. A 100-mile stretch allowed for travel to [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], Ontario where other roads could be found for travel to Ottawa.<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>\n\nTransportation links with Toronto and Georgian Bay stimulated Orillia's development as a commercial centre and summer resort.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-orillia |title=Founding of Orillia |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust|accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\nThe [[village]] of Orillia was incorporated in 1867 (sharing the same birth year as [[Canada]]). By 1875 the population was 2,000 and Orillia became a town with a mayor, reeve, deputy reeve, and nine councillors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orillia.ca/en/city-hall/history.aspx |title=History | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\nOrillia was designated a [[city]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orillia.ca/en/city-hall/municipalheritagecommitteehome.aspx |title=Heritage Home Page | publisher=City of Orillia | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Stephen Leacock]]'s 1912 book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'', Orillia was used as the basis for the fictional town known as \"Mariposa\", although Leacock stated that the fictional town could really be any town. The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E. Bell (author)|William E. Bell's]] 1989 novel ''Five Days of the Ghost'' was also set in Orillia, with many readers recognizing popular local spots, including the Guardian Angels Catholic Church, the [[Samuel de Champlain]] statue in [[Couchiching Beach Park]] as well as [[Big Chief Island]] in the middle of [[Lake Couchiching]].\n\nOrillia was the first municipality in North America to introduce [[daylight saving time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/07/08/bold-attempt-at-daylight-saving-time-became-a-comic-failure-in-orillia.html |title=Bold attempt at daylight saving time became a comic failure in Orillia|publisher=Toronto Star | date=8 July 2017 | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> and had the first municipal hydroelectric transmission plant<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM52FB_FIRST_HYDRO_ELECTRIC_PLANT__Orillia_Ontario_CANADA |title=FIRST HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT - Orillia, Ontario CANADA | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> in North America.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe first recorded use of the name to describe the region, which until then had no officially sanctioned designation, was in 1820 when the name was given in [[Toronto|York]], [[Upper Canada]] by then [[Lieutenant-Governors of Ontario|Lieutenant-Governor]] Sir [[Peregrine Maitland]]. Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandmirror.com/midlandmirror/article/142346|title=Simcoe County Breaking News - Simcoe County's Online Newspaper - Simcoe.com|website=Simcoe.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nG.W.B. Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year.

It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers. A grist mill could be found about a mile away.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E.

Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

The city has experienced growth for the past fifteen years, with a population increase of over 2,000 residents (7.0 percent) since the 2001 census. The median household income in 2015 for Orillia was $55,802, which is below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\n==Government==\nOrillia is governed by the [[Orillia City Council]], which consists of eight city councillors and a mayor.\n\nThere are four wards in the city.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1969 the council was led by a reeve or mayor. Since 1969 the head of the council is the mayor.\n\n==Grape Island==\n\n'''Grape Island''' is a lake island located off Victoria Point in the north end of [[Lake Simcoe]].\n\nToday the island is occupied by about 40 private homes or cottages and residences are part of the ''Grape Island Property Owners Association'' (c. 1952).<ref name=\"GrapeIs\">{{cite news |url=https://www.orilliamatters.com/local-news/councils-grape-island-decision-not-fair-to-anyone-820211 |title=Council's Grape Island decision 'not fair to anyone' |date=January 23, 2018|first=Dave |last=Dawson |website=OrilliaMatters.com |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> Access is restricted to residents of the island with access by boat from Forest Avenue South dock to private docks on the island.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The heavy traffic at the mainland docks have resulted in tensions between island residents and residents of Victoria Point.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The city of Orillia is working on finding a solution for access to the island without inconveniencing residents in Victoria Point.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bayshorebroadcasting.ca/news_item.php?NewsID=104117 |title=Search for New Location for Grape Island Dock |date=September 11, 2018 |first=Ken |last=Hashizume |publisher=Bayshore Broadcasting |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are no vehicular roads on the island.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandmirror.com/midlandmirror/article/142346|title=Simcoe County Breaking News - Simcoe County's Online Newspaper - Simcoe.com|website=Simcoe.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nG.W.B. Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year. Marching bands from around the country participate.\n\nSince 1963, the [[Webers]] hamburger restaurant has been approximately 1&nbsp;km north of Orillia,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Webers+Restaurant/@44.6940158,-79.3988699,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2aa6784cfe299f:0x759e8003df69dd60|title=Webers Location Google Maps|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> next to [[Ontario Highway 11]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.readersdigest.ca/food/bbq/canadas-8-greatest-burger-restaurants?id=2|title=Canada's 8 Greatest Burger Restaurants|last=Sue Campbell & Jen McMorran|work=[[Reader's Digest]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/1236157--the-dish-on-cottage-country-s-famous-foodie-treats-burgers-to-butter-tarts|title=The dish on cottage country\u2019s famous foodie treats: burgers to butter tarts|last=Ogilvie|first=Megan|date=3 August 2012|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nLake St. George Golf Club is ten minutes north of Orillia.\n\n==Education==\nBoth French and English public education is offered in Orillia.\n\nThere is one Catholic French-language elementary school, ''\u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain'', operated by the [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]].<ref>[http://www.sdc.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain]</ref>\n\nStudents from this elementary school attend ''\u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance'', which is operated by the same board and is located in Barrie.<ref>[http://www.escna.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance]</ref>\n\nEnglish public education in Orillia is provided via the [[Simcoe County District School Board]], which has nine elementary and three secondary schools in the city.

From 2010 all matches are best of five.\n\nThe competition runs over eight groups, each consisting of seven players. From the league stage of the first seven groups the top four qualify for a play-off, the winner of which qualifies for the '''winners group'''. The bottom two players of each league are eliminated and the remaining four move to the next group, where they are joined by three more players until the seventh group. The winners play in the final group with the overall winner taking a place in that year's Premier League Snooker until 2012,<ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/> and in that year's [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] from 2013.\n\nThere have been eight [[maximum break]]s in the history of the tournament.

[[Scott Donaldson]] is the reigning champion.\n\n== History and format ==\nThe event was introduced in [[2008 Championship League|2008]] by [[Barry Hearn]] to provide additional competition and a qualifier to the [[Premier League Snooker]]. 25 professionals take part, there is no audience and every match is broadcast via [[internet]] only.<ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/> Players earn money for every frame won and there are also prizes for being a semi-finalist, runner-up and winner of each group, with more money involved in the winners group.\n\nIn the first two years all matches in the group stages were the best of four, meaning that the matches could ended in a draw as all the four frames were played, and the semi-finals and final was best of five. From 2010 all matches are best of five.\n\nThe competition runs over eight groups, each consisting of seven players. From the league stage of the first seven groups the top four qualify for a play-off, the winner of which qualifies for the '''winners group'''. The bottom two players of each league are eliminated and the remaining four move to the next group, where they are joined by three more players until the seventh group. The winners play in the final group with the overall winner taking a place in that year's Premier League Snooker until 2012,<ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/> and in that year's [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] from 2013.\n\nThere have been eight [[maximum break]]s in the history of the tournament.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20.

A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to.

Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1.

Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L. J. (1943). On estimates of test reliability. Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThis anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943)<ref name=c1943/> to criticize <math> \\rho_{T}</math>, but Cronbach (1951)<ref name=Cronbach/> did not comment on this problem in his article, which discusses every topics related <math> \\rho_{T}</math> and he himself<ref name=c2004/> described as being \"encyclopedic\" (p.396).\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not.

If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items. That is, <math>\\sigma^2_t=\\overline{\\sigma_{ij}}</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_T=Var(\\sum_{i=1}^k t)=k^2 \\sigma^2_t = k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} </math>\n\nLet <math> \\rho_T </math> denote the reliability when satisfying the above assumptions. <math> \\rho_T</math> is:\n\n</br><math>\\rho_T = {k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} \\over \\sigma^2_X} </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}

They find a common interest in Allison.\n\nAfter school, the duo crosses the path of the universally-disliked Daryl and his eighth-grade friend Charlie. Later that week, the four boys meet up at Josh's house where they look through the possessions of Josh's brother, who is in the marines. They find a bag of marijuana, a pair of [[nunchaku]], and a [[katana]].\n\nAfterwards the boys slash milk cartons with the katana in a nearby forest. The boys notice that Daryl is smoking a joint and has stolen the marijuana. After a tense argument, Daryl hits Josh. The two fight, resulting in Daryl being accidentally stabbed in the throat with the katana. The boys panic and decide to hide both Daryl's body and the katana.\n\nDuring the next two days of school, rumors circulate about Daryl's disappearance. Zach has nightmares and Josh doesn\u2019t attend classes. Zach wants to return to Daryl's burial site and attend Allison's upcoming party with Josh. Josh refuses to do either.\n\nZach goes to Allison's party where he is surprised to see Josh sharing his brother's weed with everyone. Zach, disturbed, leaves. Allison pursues him and they almost kiss, but Zach says he is unable to and leaves.\n\nAnother student, John Whitcomb, is found dead. Rumors speculate that he fell off a bridge. Zach suspects that John's death was not accidental. He returns to Daryl's burial site and finds the katana missing and Darryl\u2019s corpse unearthed and mutilated. He calls Charlie and tells him that he suspects Josh killed John, but Charlie dismisses it.\n\nZach goes to Josh's house and barges into Josh's room, looking for the katana or evidence of the deaths. Zach sees Allison's phone number on Josh's caller ID and Zach frantically runs look for her. Meanwhile, Josh, Allison and Meghan smoke weed at Meghan\u2019s house. Josh unwraps the katana from under a towel to show it to them.\n\nZach arrives at Meghan's house and quietly makes his way up the stairs. He hears muffled screams coming from Meghan's bedroom and opens the door to find Josh has murdered Meghan. Allison is tied and gagged in the corner, wounded but still alive. Josh locks Zach out of the room, but Zach climbs up on the roof and breaks the window to get back inside. Zach is attacked by Josh and attempts to escape, but Josh slashes his shoulder and stabs him in the leg. Zach attempts to fight him off, but Josh begins to strangle him. A neighbor intervenes, separates them, and holds Josh down.\n\nPolice and paramedics arrive at the scene. While the paramedics attend to Zach's wounds, he glances at Josh sitting in the back of a police car.\n\nMonths later, Allison has recovered and returns to school. A camera shot from the back of the classroom reveals the scars she received from the katana: three parallel lines on the back of her neck.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Owen Campbell (actor)|Owen Campbell]] as Zach

Josh locks Zach out of the room, but Zach climbs up on the roof and breaks the window to get back inside. Zach is attacked by Josh and attempts to escape, but Josh slashes his shoulder and stabs him in the leg. Zach attempts to fight him off, but Josh begins to strangle him. A neighbor intervenes, separates them, and holds Josh down.\n\nPolice and paramedics arrive at the scene. While the paramedics attend to Zach's wounds, he glances at Josh sitting in the back of a police car.\n\nMonths later, Allison has recovered and returns to school. A camera shot from the back of the classroom reveals the scars she received from the katana: three parallel lines on the back of her neck.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Owen Campbell (actor)|Owen Campbell]] as Zach Taylor \n*[[Charlie Tahan]] as Josh Templeton\n*Elizabeth Cappuccino as Allison Bannister\n*[[Max Talisman]] as Daryl Harper\n*[[Sawyer Barth]] as Charlie Barth\n*[[Amy Hargreaves]] as Karen Taylor\n*Adea Lennox as Meghan\n*Ethan Botwick as John Whitcomb\n*Anni Krueger as Mrs. Barron\n*Kortnee Simmons as Eugene\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Neil|title='Super Dark Times': Film Review;

Lake Bonneville was a pluvial lake in the sense that it formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. Lake Bonneville covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.\n\n==Geologic description==\n[[File:Lake bonneville map.svg|thumb|Lake Bonneville and other ice age [[pluvial]] lakes (17,500 years before the present), and modern remnants]]\nShorelines of Lake Bonneville are visible above Salt Lake City along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains and on other mountains throughout the Bonneville basin.<ref name=\":0\">Gilbert, G.K., 1890.

Lake Bonneville was a pluvial lake in the sense that it formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. Lake Bonneville covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.\n\n==Geologic description==\n[[File:Lake bonneville map.svg|thumb|Lake Bonneville and other ice age [[pluvial]] lakes (17,500 years before the present), and modern remnants]]\nShorelines of Lake Bonneville are visible above Salt Lake City along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains and on other mountains throughout the Bonneville basin.<ref name=\":0\">Gilbert, G.K., 1890.

She was the daughter of the novelist and lyricist [[Archibald Thomas Pechey]] and Bijou Sortain Hancock.\n\nCradock was born at her maternal grandparents' house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone. The birth was formally registered in London, in the district of [[West Ham]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: June Qtr, 1909, Phyllis Nan S. Pechey, at W. Ham, vol 4a, page 369</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelled) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: \"Fanny Craddock 1909\u20131994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.\"\n\nHer birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character! (From Bournemouth Echo) |publisher=Bournemouthecho.co.uk |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nArchibald moved the family again to [[Wroxham]] in Norfolk, c. 1927, where his creditors caught up with him and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk's bankruptcy court faced with debts of \u00a33,500. Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W. H. Allen, 1978 {{ISBN|0-491-02472-X}}</ref> which appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who didn't last very long.\nThroughout her television career the Cradocks also worked for the British Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many \"infomercials,\" instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T89IoUN43s |title=Kitchen Magic - Fanny Cradock (1963) Gas Council film NEW TRANSFER |publisher=YouTube |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Despite the BBC's ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she \"hated\" electric stoves and ovens.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6i4IdtC4w |title=Fanny Cradock on TV-am \u2013 1985 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHer series ''Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas'' is the only one of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK digital television channels [[BBC4]], [[Good Food]] and [[Food Network|Food Network UK]], usually in the run-up to Christmas.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day.

They became regulars on the chat show circuit, and also appeared on programmes such as ''[[The Generation Game]]'' and ''[[Blankety Blank]]''. Fanny appeared alone on ''[[Wogan]]'', ''Parkinson'' and ''[[TV-am]]''. When she appeared on the television chat show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' with [[Danny La Rue]] and it was revealed to her that La Rue was actually a female impersonator, she stormed off the set.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/10/broadcasting.uknews | title=Secret drugs menu of TV chef Fanny | publisher=The Guardian | date=10 September 2006 | accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> Her final [[BBC]] appearance and her final television appearance was in early 1988 on ''Windmill'' presented by Chris Serle.\n\n==Personal life==\nCradock married four times, twice bigamously. First she married Sidney A. Vernon Evans on 10 October 1926, she was 17, he was 22.<ref>GRO Register of Marriages: 1926, December Qtr, Phyllis N. Primrose Pechey & Sydney A. V. Evans, in Sheppey,  Kent, vol 2a, page 2368a</ref> Cradock married as \"Phyllis Nan Primrose Pechey\"; \"Primrose Pechey\" was a form passed down her father's side. Sidney Evans died in a plane crash on 4 February 1927,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: MAR 1927 2b 309 NEWHAVEN \u2013 Sidney A. V.

Evans, mmn = Primrose-Pechey or Pechey</ref> who was adopted by his grandparents. Thanks to Johnnie Cradock, Peter later became a [[sous-chef]] at the [[Dorchester Hotel]].\n\nBy July of the following year Cradock had become pregnant again, and married the baby's father Arthur William Chapman on 23 July.<ref>Marriage: 1928, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. V. Evans & Arthur W. Chapman, in Norwich, Norfolk, vol 4b, page 316</ref> For this marriage Cradock gave her name as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Vernon Evans.\"\n\nThe couple had a son Christopher,<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1929 4b 422 DOWNHAM \u2013 Christopher A. J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.) For this marriage Cradock went with a pared down version of her name (\"Phyllis Chapman\"), and the then 68-year-old recorded her age as 55 on the marriage certificate, even though she had a son who was nearly fifty.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/livesandtimes/Fanny-Cradock.2809175.jp |title=Fanny Cradock - People - Scotsman.com |publisher=Heritage.scotsman.com |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nShe died following a stroke on 27 December 1994; the cause of death was cited as 'cerebrovascular atherosclerosis'. Both Fanny and Johnnie were cremated at [[Langney|Langney Crematorium]], [[Eastbourne]]. There is a memorial plaque and a rosebush in the grounds of the crematorium for both of them.\n\n==Legacy==\nFanny Cradock came to the attention of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking.<ref>'Something's Burning: The Autobiography of Two Cooks\u2019 by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (1960)</ref> She famously worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook's apron, averring that women should feel cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.<ref>\u2019Fabulous Fanny Cradock: TV's Outrageous Queen of Cuisine\u2019 by Clive Ellis</ref>\n\nIn her early anonymous role as a food critic, working with Major Cradock under the name of 'Bon Viveur',<ref>''The Daily Telegraph Cook's Book'' by Bon Viveur (1964)</ref> Fanny introduced the public to unusual dishes from France and Italy, popularising the [[pizza]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>''Common Market Cookery: France'' by Fanny Cradock (22 Nov 1973)</ref> She and Johnny worked together on a touring cookery show, sponsored by the Gas Council, to show how gas could be used easily in the kitchen and, as their fame increased, Fanny's shows transferred to television, where she enjoyed 20 years of success.<ref>''Time to Remember: A Cook for All Seasons'' by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (10 Aug 1981)</ref>\n\nIn the course of her shows Fanny made frequent concessions to the economic realities of the era, suggesting cheaper alternatives which would be within reach of the housewife's purse. The BBC published her recipes and suggestions for dinner-parties in a series of booklets, consolidating her reputation as the foremost celebrity chef of her day.<ref>\u2018Giving a Dinner Party\u2019 (Publications/British Broadcasting Corporation) by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (Jun 1969)</ref>\n\n[[Marguerite Patten]] has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. [[Brian Turner (chef)|Brian Turner]] has said that he respects Fanny's career and [[Delia Smith]] has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series ''The Way We Cooked'' in an episode dedicated to Cradock and [[Graham Kerr]], [[Keith Floyd]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her [[cookery]] books sold in record numbers. In the third series of ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', [[Gordon Ramsay]] held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.\n\n==Media portrayals==\nFanny Cradock's husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as [[Betty Marsden]]'s 'Fanny Haddock' in two BBC Radio comedy shows, ''[[Beyond our Ken]]'' (1958\u201364) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201368). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' and on ''[[Benny Hill]]'', with Benny as Fanny and [[Bob Todd]] as an invariably drunk Johnnie.\n\nCradock's life has also been the subject of the plays ''Doughnuts Like Fanny's'' by [[Julia Darling]] and ''Fear of Fanny'' by Brian Fillis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodhallagency.com/index.php?art_id=000432 |title=The Knight Hall Agency Limited |publisher=Rodhallagency.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, ''Fear of Fanny'' was turned into a television drama starring [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Julia Davis]] and featuring [[Hayley Atwell]]. The production broadcast in October 2006 on [[BBC Four]] as one of a series of [[culinary]]-themed dramas.\n\n''Sucking Shrimp'' by Stephanie Theobald has Fanny Cradock as one of its central characters. To provincial Cornish heroine Rosa Barge, Cradock represents glamour, sophistication and the life she aspires to in her concoctions of a Taj Mahal out of Italian meringue and duchesse potato dyed vivid green.<ref>{{cite book | title=Sucking Shrimp | publisher=Hodder and Stoughton | year=2001 | isbn=978-0340768433}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the cabaret group 'Duckie' staged ''Duckie Loves Fanny'' as part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest's programme of events marking the locale's year-long status as London Borough of Culture.

Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character! (From Bournemouth Echo) |publisher=Bournemouthecho.co.uk |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nArchibald moved the family again to [[Wroxham]] in Norfolk, c. 1927, where his creditors caught up with him and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk's bankruptcy court faced with debts of \u00a33,500. Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W. H. Allen, 1978 {{ISBN|0-491-02472-X}}</ref> which appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who didn't last very long.\nThroughout her television career the Cradocks also worked for the British Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many \"infomercials,\" instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T89IoUN43s |title=Kitchen Magic - Fanny Cradock (1963) Gas Council film NEW TRANSFER |publisher=YouTube |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Despite the BBC's ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she \"hated\" electric stoves and ovens.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6i4IdtC4w |title=Fanny Cradock on TV-am \u2013 1985 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHer series ''Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas'' is the only one of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK digital television channels [[BBC4]], [[Good Food]] and [[Food Network|Food Network UK]], usually in the run-up to Christmas.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day.

S. V. Evans & Arthur W.

J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.)

[[Brian Turner (chef)|Brian Turner]] has said that he respects Fanny's career and [[Delia Smith]] has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series ''The Way We Cooked'' in an episode dedicated to Cradock and [[Graham Kerr]], [[Keith Floyd]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her [[cookery]] books sold in record numbers. In the third series of ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', [[Gordon Ramsay]] held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.\n\n==Media portrayals==\nFanny Cradock's husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as [[Betty Marsden]]'s 'Fanny Haddock' in two BBC Radio comedy shows, ''[[Beyond our Ken]]'' (1958\u201364) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201368). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' and on ''[[Benny Hill]]'', with Benny as Fanny and [[Bob Todd]] as an invariably drunk Johnnie.\n\nCradock's life has also been the subject of the plays ''Doughnuts Like Fanny's'' by [[Julia Darling]] and ''Fear of Fanny'' by Brian Fillis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodhallagency.com/index.php?art_id=000432 |title=The Knight Hall Agency Limited |publisher=Rodhallagency.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, ''Fear of Fanny'' was turned into a television drama starring [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Julia Davis]] and featuring [[Hayley Atwell]].

The common representation is that of a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This [[monopodial]] character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include ''[[Washingtonia]]'' and ''[[Roystonea]]''. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively [[sympodial]] genera include many of the [[rattan]]s, ''[[Guihaia]]'', and ''[[Rhapis]]''. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters and vice versa. These aberrations suggest the habit operates on a single gene.<ref name=uhl>Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) ''Genera Palmarum \u2013 A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E.

Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four [[carpel]]s. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.\n\nSubfamily '''Calamoideae''' includes the climbing palms, such as rattans. The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters ([[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, an extension of the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.\n\nSubfamily '''Nypoideae''' contains only one species, ''Nypa fruticans'',<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Palms: Biogeography, Ecology and Systematics|author=John Leslie Dowe|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Nypoideae#v=onepage&q=Nypoideae&f=false|page=83|accessdate=April 20, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202163500/http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Nypoideae&source=bl&ots=GLh89V2U04&sig=-rXN3kSbWv1-bOs8xgcDThEfC84&hl=vi&sa=X&ei=ekWRT4iCJ4TeigfavvSJBA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nypoideae&f=false|archivedate=February 2, 2014|isbn=9780643096158|year=2010}}</ref> which has large, pinnate leaves. The fruit is unusual in that it floats, and the stem is dichotomously branched, also unusual in palms.\n\nSubfamily '''Ceroxyloideae''' has small to medium-sized flowers, spirally arranged, with a [[gynoecium]] of three joined carpels.\n\nThe '''Arecoideae''' are the largest subfamily, with six diverse tribes ([[Areceae]], [[Caryoteae]], [[Cocoseae]], [[Geonomeae]], [[Iriarteeae]], and [[Podococceae]]) containing over 100 genera. All tribes have pinnate or bipinnate leaves and flowers arranged in groups of three, with a central pistillate and two staminate flowers.\n\nThe '''Phytelephantoideae''' are a [[monoecious]] subfamily. Members of this group have distinct monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts.<ref name = \"UA\"/>\n\nCurrently, few extensive phylogenetic studies of the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker'' et al.'' explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast [[DNA]] from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested the lack of a fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, [[homoplasy]] in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard [[DNA marker]]s, and character polarization.<ref>Hahn, W.J.

Palms appear to have undergone an early period of [[adaptive radiation]]. By 60&nbsp;Mya, many of the modern, specialized genera of palms appeared and became widespread and common, much more widespread than their range today. Because palms separated from the monocots earlier than other families, they developed more intrafamilial specialization and diversity.

Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity.

The common representation is that of a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This [[monopodial]] character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include ''[[Washingtonia]]'' and ''[[Roystonea]]''. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively [[sympodial]] genera include many of the [[rattan]]s, ''[[Guihaia]]'', and ''[[Rhapis]]''. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters and vice versa. These aberrations suggest the habit operates on a single gene.<ref name=uhl>Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) ''Genera Palmarum \u2013 A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E.

Moore, who organized palms into 15 major groups based mostly on general morphological characteristics. The following classification, proposed by N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield in 1987, is a revision of Moore's classification that organizes palms into six subfamilies.<ref>N. W. Uhl, J. Dransfield (1987). ''Genera palmarum: a classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore, Jr.'' (Allen Press, Lawrence, Kansas).</ref>\n\n* Coryphoideae\n* Calamoideae\n* Nypoideae\n* Ceroxyloideae\n* Arecoideae\n* Phytelephantoideae\n\nA few general traits of each subfamily are listed below.\n\nThe '''Coryphoideae''' are the most diverse subfamily, and are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group, meaning all members of the group share a common ancestor, but the group does not include all the ancestor's descendants. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four [[carpel]]s. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.\n\nSubfamily '''Calamoideae''' includes the climbing palms, such as rattans. The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters ([[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, an extension of the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.\n\nSubfamily '''Nypoideae''' contains only one species, ''Nypa fruticans'',<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Palms: Biogeography, Ecology and Systematics|author=John Leslie Dowe|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Nypoideae#v=onepage&q=Nypoideae&f=false|page=83|accessdate=April 20, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202163500/http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Nypoideae&source=bl&ots=GLh89V2U04&sig=-rXN3kSbWv1-bOs8xgcDThEfC84&hl=vi&sa=X&ei=ekWRT4iCJ4TeigfavvSJBA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nypoideae&f=false|archivedate=February 2, 2014|isbn=9780643096158|year=2010}}</ref> which has large, pinnate leaves. The fruit is unusual in that it floats, and the stem is dichotomously branched, also unusual in palms.\n\nSubfamily '''Ceroxyloideae''' has small to medium-sized flowers, spirally arranged, with a [[gynoecium]] of three joined carpels.\n\nThe '''Arecoideae''' are the largest subfamily, with six diverse tribes ([[Areceae]], [[Caryoteae]], [[Cocoseae]], [[Geonomeae]], [[Iriarteeae]], and [[Podococceae]]) containing over 100 genera. All tribes have pinnate or bipinnate leaves and flowers arranged in groups of three, with a central pistillate and two staminate flowers.\n\nThe '''Phytelephantoideae''' are a [[monoecious]] subfamily. Members of this group have distinct monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts.<ref name = \"UA\"/>\n\nCurrently, few extensive phylogenetic studies of the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker'' et al.'' explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast [[DNA]] from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested the lack of a fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, [[homoplasy]] in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard [[DNA marker]]s, and character polarization.<ref>Hahn, W.J.

The first modern species, such as ''[[Nypa fruticans| Nypa fruticans]]'' and ''[[Acrocomia|Acrocomia aculeata]]'', appeared 94&nbsp;Mya, confirmed by fossil ''Nypa'' pollen dated to 94&nbsp;Mya. Palms appear to have undergone an early period of [[adaptive radiation]]. By 60&nbsp;Mya, many of the modern, specialized genera of palms appeared and became widespread and common, much more widespread than their range today. Because palms separated from the monocots earlier than other families, they developed more intrafamilial specialization and diversity. By tracing back these diverse characteristics of palms to the basic structures of monocots, palms may be valuable in studying monocot evolution.<ref>[http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/evolution/vpe_evolution.htm Virtual Palm Encyclopedia \u2013 Evolution and the fossil record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418044328/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/evolution/vpe_evolution.htm |date=2006-04-18 }}</ref>  Several species of palms have been identified from flowers preserved in amber, including ''[[Palaeoraphe|Palaeoraphe dominicana]]'' and ''[[Roystonea palaea]]''.<ref name=\"Poinar2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Poinar |first1=G. |year=2002 |title= Fossil palm flowers in Dominican and Baltic amber|journal= Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=139 |issue = 4 |pages=361\u2013367 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8339.2002.00052.x|doi-access=free }}</ref>  Evidence can also be found in samples of [[petrified palmwood]].\n\n==Uses==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Palm nut concentrate.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.81|Canned palmnut concentrate]] -->\nHuman use of palms is as old or older than human civilization itself, starting with the cultivation of the date palm by [[Mesopotamia]]ns and other Middle Eastern peoples 5000 years or more ago.<ref name=\"FAO date palm info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0681E/t0681e02.htm |title=Date Palm Products \u2013 Introduction |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]| accessdate=2007-06-12 |author =  W.H.

The greatest risk to palms is [[habitat destruction|destruction of habitat]], especially in the [[tropical forest]]s, due to [[urbanization]], [[wood-chipping]], [[mining]], and [[conversion to farmland]]. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them.

At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.<ref name = \"VPEintro\"/>\n\nHowever, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo. Using botanical gardens for conservation also presents problems, since they can rarely house more than a few plants of any species or truly imitate the natural setting.<ref name = \"VPEconserv\"/> Also, the risk of cross-pollination can lead to hybrid species.\n\nThe Palm Specialist Group of the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) began in 1984, and has performed a series of three studies to find basic information on the status of palms in the wild, use of wild palms, and palms under cultivation. Two projects on palm conservation and use supported by the [[WWF (conservation organization)|World Wildlife Fund]] took place from 1985 to 1990 and 1986\u20131991, in the American tropics and southeast Asia, respectively. Both studies produced copious new data and publications on palms.
