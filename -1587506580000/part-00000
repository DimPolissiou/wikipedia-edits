Starting from Gaetano Chierici's theory that the pile dwellings further north represented an ancestral Roman population, Pigorini developed a theory of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] settlement of Italy from the north.\n\n==Settlements==\n[[File:Terramare abitazioni.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed Terramare houses]]\nThe Terramare, in spite of local differences, is of typical form; each settlement is trapezoidal, with streets arranged in a quadrangular pattern.

Small [[clay]] figures, chiefly of animals (though human figures are found at Castellazzo), are interesting as being practically the earliest specimens of plastic art found in Italy.\n\n==Society==\n[[File:Museo Civico Archeologico di Castelleone - Prop. Civica M.A.1 - scure.jpg|thumb|Bronze axe]]\nThe occupations of the terramare people as compared with their Neolithic predecessors may be inferred with comparative certainty. They remained hunters, but also had domesticated animals; they were fairly skilful [[metallurgist]]s, casting bronze in [[Molding (process)|mould]]s of stone and clay; they were also agriculturists, cultivating [[bean]]s, [[grape]]s, [[wheat]], and [[flax]].\n\nAccording to [[William Ridgeway]]<ref>''Who were the Romans?'' p. 16; and ''Early Age of Greece'', i. 496</ref> the dead were treated to [[inhumation]]: further investigation, however, of the cemeteries shows that both inhumation and [[cremation]] were practiced, with cremated remains placed in [[ossuaries]]; practically no objects were found in the [[urn]]s. Cremation may have been a later introduction.\n\n==Development and collapse==\nFor the early phases of the Middle Bronze Age it is plausible to think of the Terramare in terms of a polycentric settlement system, with apparently no substantial differences between one village and another. The density of dwellings rose, and in the MB2 (1550\u20131450 BC) is worthy of note. There are areas, coinciding with those that have been most extensively investigated, in which the inhabited settlements in this phase are no more than 2 kilometres one from the other. It can therefore be supposed that the entire territory was occupied by a tight-knit network of villages, a polycentric system with settlements generally covering between 1 and 2 hectares and occupied by up to 250/260 inhabitants (about 125 per hectare). At that point, the dimension of the settlements began to vary. Until the MB2, their size did not normally exceed two hectares, but during the MB3 (1450\u20131350 BC), there was a substantial increase in the surface area occupied by certain of these settlements, while others remained limited in size or disappeared altogether. This tendency was consolidated in the LBA. Several of these settlements cover an area of up to 20 hectares. The size of the embankments and ditches can reach remarkable proportions, some exceeding 30 metres in width. For the more advanced phase of the Middle Bronze Age, and above all during the Late Bronze Age (1350\u20131150 BC), we can hypothesise a greater degree of diversified territorial organisation, including centres which are larger and tending towards hegemony, adjacent to smaller sites. In certain areas during the LBA, we see a higher frequency of sites occupying a larger extension and a scant presence of small-size settlements, perhaps due to a marked tendency towards concentration of population. This trend seems to be accentuated during the advanced LBA, when the overall number of settlements decreases, with a tendency towards concentration in larger-size settlements and probable subordination of the smaller settlements to the larger ones.\n\nAround 1200 BC a serious crisis began for the terramare culture that within a few years led to the abandonment of all the settlements; the reasons for this crisis, roughly contemporaneous with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] in the eastern Mediterranean, are still not entirely clear, it seems possible that in the face of an incipient overpopulation (between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals were calculated) and depletion of natural resources, a series of drought periods led to a deep economic crisis, famine, and consequently the disruption of the political order, which caused the [[Societal collapse|collapse of society]]. Around 1150 BC the terramare were completely abandoned, with no settlements replacing them. The plains, especially in the area of Emilia, were abandoned for several centuries, and only in the Roman era they regain the density of population reached during the terramare period.\n\nIt has been suggested that the memory of the fate of the terramare culture may have lasted for centuries, until it was recorded by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], in his first book on the Roman Antiquities, as the fate of the [[Pelasgians]]. In his record the Pelasgians occupied the Po Valley up to two generations before the Trojan War, but were forced, by a series of famines of which they could not understand the reason, or find a solution, to leave their once-fertile land and move to the south, where they merged with the Aborigines.<ref name=\"Cardarelli\"/>\n\n==Theories of ethnic identity==\nGreat differences of opinion have arisen as to the origin and ethnographic relations of the Terramare population.\n\n[[Edoardo Brizio]], in his ''Epoca preistorica'' (1898), advanced a theory that the Terramare population had been the original [[Ligures|Ligurians]]. Brizio believed that the Ligures, at some early point, took to erecting pile dwellings, although why they should have abandoned their previously unprotected hut-settlements for elaborate fortifications is unclear. While Brizio did not envision invading peoples until long after the Terramare period, the pile dwellings, ramparts and moats at Terramare sites have usually seemed more akin to military defenses, than the prevention of inundation during regular flooding; for instance, Terramare buildings usually stood on hills. There are other difficulties of a similar character with Brizio's theory.\n\n[[Luigi Pigorini]] (1842\u20131925) proposed that a population derived from the Terramare culture was a dominant component of the [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] \u2013 especially in its northern and Campanian phases and the Terramare culture has been an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] population, the ancestors of the ''Italici'', i.e. the [[Italic languages|Italic]]-speaking peoples. Pigorini also attributed to the ''Italici'' a tradition of lake dwellings, modified in Italy into Terramare-style [[pile dwelling]] on dry land. <ref name=rellini1937>{{cite encyclopedia| last =Rellini | first =Ugo | encyclopedia =  Enciclopedia Italiana | title = Terramare| url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/terramare_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/| language =Italian | date =1937 | publisher =Treccani | quote =Teoria terramaricola. - Venne enunciata in modo compiuto da Gaetano Chierici fino dal 1871; importantissimo \u00e8 anche il suo scritto del 1881.

Small [[clay]] figures, chiefly of animals (though human figures are found at Castellazzo), are interesting as being practically the earliest specimens of plastic art found in Italy.\n\n==Society==\n[[File:Museo Civico Archeologico di Castelleone - Prop. Civica M.A.1 - scure.jpg|thumb|Bronze axe]]\nThe occupations of the terramare people as compared with their Neolithic predecessors may be inferred with comparative certainty. They remained hunters, but also had domesticated animals; they were fairly skilful [[metallurgist]]s, casting bronze in [[mould]]s of stone and clay; they were also agriculturists, cultivating [[bean]]s, [[grape]]s, [[wheat]], and [[flax]].\n\nAccording to [[William Ridgeway]]<ref>''Who were the Romans?'' p. 16; and ''Early Age of Greece'', i. 496</ref> the dead were treated to [[inhumation]]: further investigation, however, of the cemeteries shows that both inhumation and [[cremation]] were practiced, with cremated remains placed in [[ossuaries]]; practically no objects were found in the [[urn]]s. Cremation may have been a later introduction.\n\n==Development and collapse==\nFor the early phases of the Middle Bronze Age it is plausible to think of the Terramare in terms of a polycentric settlement system, with apparently no substantial differences between one village and another. The density of dwellings rose, and in the MB2 (1550\u20131450 BC) is worthy of note. There are areas, coinciding with those that have been most extensively investigated, in which the inhabited settlements in this phase are no more than 2 kilometres one from the other. It can therefore be supposed that the entire territory was occupied by a tight-knit network of villages, a polycentric system with settlements generally covering between 1 and 2 hectares and occupied by up to 250/260 inhabitants (about 125 per hectare). At that point, the dimension of the settlements began to vary. Until the MB2, their size did not normally exceed two hectares, but during the MB3 (1450\u20131350 BC), there was a substantial increase in the surface area occupied by certain of these settlements, while others remained limited in size or disappeared altogether. This tendency was consolidated in the LBA. Several of these settlements cover an area of up to 20 hectares. The size of the embankments and ditches can reach remarkable proportions, some exceeding 30 metres in width. For the more advanced phase of the Middle Bronze Age, and above all during the Late Bronze Age (1350\u20131150 BC), we can hypothesise a greater degree of diversified territorial organisation, including centres which are larger and tending towards hegemony, adjacent to smaller sites. In certain areas during the LBA, we see a higher frequency of sites occupying a larger extension and a scant presence of small-size settlements, perhaps due to a marked tendency towards concentration of population. This trend seems to be accentuated during the advanced LBA, when the overall number of settlements decreases, with a tendency towards concentration in larger-size settlements and probable subordination of the smaller settlements to the larger ones.\n\nAround 1200 BC a serious crisis began for the terramare culture that within a few years led to the abandonment of all the settlements; the reasons for this crisis, roughly contemporaneous with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] in the eastern Mediterranean, are still not entirely clear, it seems possible that in the face of an incipient overpopulation (between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals were calculated) and depletion of natural resources, a series of drought periods led to a deep economic crisis, famine, and consequently the disruption of the political order, which caused the [[Societal collapse|collapse of society]]. Around 1150 BC the terramare were completely abandoned, with no settlements replacing them. The plains, especially in the area of Emilia, were abandoned for several centuries, and only in the Roman era they regain the density of population reached during the terramare period.\n\nIt has been suggested that the memory of the fate of the terramare culture may have lasted for centuries, until it was recorded by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], in his first book on the Roman Antiquities, as the fate of the [[Pelasgians]]. In his record the Pelasgians occupied the Po Valley up to two generations before the Trojan War, but were forced, by a series of famines of which they could not understand the reason, or find a solution, to leave their once-fertile land and move to the south, where they merged with the Aborigines.<ref name=\"Cardarelli\"/>\n\n==Theories of ethnic identity==\nGreat differences of opinion have arisen as to the origin and ethnographic relations of the Terramare population.\n\n[[Edoardo Brizio]], in his ''Epoca preistorica'' (1898), advanced a theory that the Terramare population had been the original [[Ligures|Ligurians]]. Brizio believed that the Ligures, at some early point, took to erecting pile dwellings, although why they should have abandoned their previously unprotected hut-settlements for elaborate fortifications is unclear. While Brizio did not envision invading peoples until long after the Terramare period, the pile dwellings, ramparts and moats at Terramare sites have usually seemed more akin to military defenses, than the prevention of inundation during regular flooding; for instance, Terramare buildings usually stood on hills. There are other difficulties of a similar character with Brizio's theory.\n\n[[Luigi Pigorini]] (1842\u20131925) proposed that a population derived from the Terramare culture was a dominant component of the [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] \u2013 especially in its northern and Campanian phases and the Terramare culture has been an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] population, the ancestors of the ''Italici'', i.e. the [[Italic languages|Italic]]-speaking peoples. Pigorini also attributed to the ''Italici'' a tradition of lake dwellings, modified in Italy into Terramare-style [[pile dwelling]] on dry land. <ref name=rellini1937>{{cite encyclopedia| last =Rellini | first =Ugo | encyclopedia =  Enciclopedia Italiana | title = Terramare| url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/terramare_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/| language =Italian | date =1937 | publisher =Treccani | quote =Teoria terramaricola. - Venne enunciata in modo compiuto da Gaetano Chierici fino dal 1871; importantissimo \u00e8 anche il suo scritto del 1881.

Advanced composite [[thermoplastic]]s can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes, woven fabrics, randomly oriented fiber mat or chopped strand.

Also, it is one of the lowest cost molding methods compared with other methods such as [[transfer molding]] and [[injection molding]]; moreover it wastes relatively little material, giving it an advantage when working with expensive compounds. \n\nHowever, compression molding often provides poor product consistency and difficulty in controlling [[molding flash|flashing]], and it is not suitable for some types of parts.

Once molding is completed excess Flash may be removed. Typically, compression molding machines open along a vertical axis.\n\n==Process characteristics==\nThe use of thermoset plastic compounds characterizes this molding process from many of the other molding processes.  These thermosets can be in either preform or granule shapes.  Unlike some of the other processes we find that the materials are usually preheated and measured before molding.  This helps to reduce excess flash.  Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the plastic.  As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an inherent indefinite shelf-life and shorter cycle moulding times are widely used and examples are shown in Ref 3.\n\n==Process schematic==\nCompression molding is one of the oldest manufacturing technique for rubber molding. The process parameters includes molding time, temperature, and pressure. Usually,  a 300-400 ton clamp pressure is used. The typical mold is shaped like a clam shell. The molding press looked a lot like a ladle filled vertical press used for casting aluminum. The bottom of the mold was always the cavity. Compression molding used preforms made by an extruder/wink cutter or a roller die/die cutter. Wink meaning that 2 blades meet on center to cut the extrudate to length. For example; Molding water bottles used die cut sheets from a roller die. The sheet was 3 inch by 6 inch. The first sheet was placed- one below a core and one sheet of equal size above the core, and then the top of the mold lowered by hand or by hoist to near shut. The mold was then pushed into the press. The start button hydraulically closed the vertical press to full pressure. The mold temperature was about 350 degrees. The platens of the presses were steam heated.   When the cycle ended (about 3.5-4.0 Minutes) the press would open and the mold would be pulled out toward the operator. The operator would try to open the clam shell mold top, and then lean the top of the mold back against the press.  Exposed is the bottle with the core still inside.  While the bottle was still hot the operator would insert prongs like reverse pliers in between the bottle rubber and the steel core. The operator would then stretch the bottle at the neck over the core to free the bottle.  In preparation of compression molding baby nipples and golf ball centers the preforms were extruded. The baby nipple was a kidney shape about 2 inches tall and 1/2 inch wide in the middle.  The golf ball center preform had a 1 x 1 inch round slug.  Both slugs were designed to stand up in the mold cavity.  During the cycle the operator would load the jig with slugs.  When the mold is opened, the lower platen would lower and the mold would be hydraulically pushed ou to the operator. Therein, the heat sheet (all molded parts from that cycle were joined together by a parting line rind (flash)) were placed in a transfer cart. The next cycle began by the jig being put over the mold. The slide tray was pulled and the preforms were released into the cavity of the mold. The start button moved the lower platen back into the press and the cure cycle bagan again.  Therein the first cycle was complete.  Each operator ran an average of 4 presses. Loading an unload was done during the cycle.  The heat sheets removed from the mold were then transported to a die station. The die out station would remove the rind leaving the finished parts. With the evolution of compression molding, next was injection transfer. Basically the extruder was made part of the molding cycle.  The rubber was injected into an upper heated platen station, and then pressure was applied to transfer molten rubber to the clamped mold. The design of injection transfer and improved molds were more so plastic injection molding except the platens and molds of injection transfer are heated. In contrast plastic Injections molding shoots a hot plastic into a cold mold.\n\n==Workpiece geometry==\n\n==Setup and equipment==\n\n==Typical tools and geometry produced==\nThree types of molds used are the flash plunger-type, straight plunger-type, and the \"landed\" plunger-type molds.  The flash type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding from the mold).  The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash.  The landed plunger type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further details are explained in Ref 3.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Matrix molding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Todd, Robert H., Dell K. Allen, and Leo Alting.

{"title_page": "Tzaraath", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{short description|Disfigurative conditions of the skin, clothing and houses}}\n{{Tumah and taharah|expanded=Miscellaneous}}\n'''''Tzaraath''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \u05e6\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea {{IPA-he|tsa\u02c8\u0281a\u0295at|}}, [[Romanization|Romanized]] [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''\u1e63\u0101ra\u02bba\u1e6f''' and numerous variants of [[English language|English]] [[transliteration]], including ''saraath'', ''tzaraas'', ''tzaraat'', ''tsaraas'' and ''tsaraat'') describes disfigurative conditions of the skin, hair of the beard and head, clothing made of linen or wool, or stones of homes located in the [[land of Israel]]. All variations are mainly referred to in chapters 13\u201314 of [[Leviticus]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe noun form comes from the verb ''tzara'' (\u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2) which means \"to have a skin disease.\" The [[root word|linguistic root]] of ''tzaraath'' may mean \"smiting\", in comparison with Arabic, in reference to a Talmudical explanation that it serves as a punishment for [[sin]];<ref name=\"EncBib\">Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref> it is quite possible that ''tzaraath'' was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> and the [[Talmud]] maintains a similar view, arguing that ''tzaraath'' referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin.<ref>Sifra 60a</ref>\n\n== Translations ==\nThe [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] [[Torah]] text describes three variations of ''tzaraath'' affecting the skin: \u05e9\u05d0\u05ea, \u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea (Se'eth, Sapachath and Bahereth). The [[Septuagint]], a translation of the Hebrew Bible originally used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] and Gentile [[proselytes]], translates the term ''tzaraath'' with Greek ''lepra'' (\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1), from which the cognate \"[[leprosy]]\" was traditionally used in English Bibles. The classical Greek term ''lepra'' stems from the noun ''lepis'' \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (a scale (of a fish), which in turn stems from the verb ''lep\u00f3'' \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 (to peel), hence leprosy (literally, morbid scaliness).<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon article \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03b1 , Ion. \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03c1\u03b7 , \u1f21, (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2) cites \"A. leprosy, which makes the skin scaly, [[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' 1.138, [[Hippocrates]] ''Aphorisms'' 3.20 (plural), Prorrh.2.43 (pl.), Epid.5.9 (sg.), Morb.1.3 (sg.), Arist.Pr.887a34, [[Theophrastus]] ''Characters'' 19.2, Sud.14, [[LXX]] Leviticus 13.2.</ref> The JPS Tanakh translates it as a \"scaly affection\" in Leviticus 13:2.\n\n''Tzaraath'' is sufficiently dissimilar from leprosy to be considered a different disease altogether, despite its coincidental translation in the Septuagint. For instance, ''tzaraath'' is not contagious between individuals, whereas leprosy is slightly contagious. The ''metzora'' (Hebrew term for one afflicted with ''tzaraath'') is barred from entering Israel's encampment (in the desert) or the city of Jerusalem not because of contagiousness but because of [[Tumah and Taharah|ritual impurity]]. The [[New Testament]] describes instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy ([[Luke 5]]:10), although the precise relationship between this, ''tzaraath'', and Hansen's disease is not established.\n\n== Torah ==\nThe Torah identifies three manifestations of ''tzaraath'': as an affliction of human skin,<ref>Leviticus 13:2</ref> of garments,<ref>Leviticus 13:47</ref> and of houses.<ref>Leviticus 14:34</ref> The Torah also speaks of ''tzaraath'' on two other occasions, one in reference to [[Moses]] and the other in reference to his sister, [[Miriam]]. In Exodus 4:6\u20137, when Moses is standing before the [[burning bush]], he doubts that Jews will believe that he is the messenger of God. God provides him with two signs to prove his mission: turning his rod into a snake and then back into a rod and turning his hand into being stricken with ''tzaraath'' and then back again. Moses revealed these wonders to the elders in Exodus 4:30.\n\nIn Numbers 12:10, Miriam was stricken with ''tzaraath'' for her involvement in slandering Moses. [[Aaron]] asks Moses to cure her via extraordinary means, because he claims that he, as her own brother, cannot examine, confine or purify her. Moses prays for his sister and she is cured of the ''tzaraath'' but must remain in confinement for seven days. The Torah, however, does not indicate that she went through any purification process similar to what is normally required.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some (such as [[ArtScroll|ArtScroll/Mesorah]]) the three subdivisions of skin ''tzaraath'' are best left transliterated, rather than translated, because there are no equivalent English terms and any attempt to translate them greatly diminishes the distinctiveness and focus of the [[Hebrew]] term. Though this is not the view of the [[Jewish Publication Society]] nor of the [[Bible Society]]. Additionally, a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' is not to be performed by anyone but a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest).\n\nSome say the manifestation of ''tzaraath'' is termed a ''negah'' (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2) \"affliction\", ''nega'im'' (plural: \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd) and there are three varieties of ''nega'im'' that relate to human flesh, two of which are:\n#boils and burns (Leviticus 13:18\u201328)\n#bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, the ''negah'' of which is called a \u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 (''netek'') (Leviticus 13:29\u201344)\n\n== Mishnah ==\nThe laws of ''tzaraath'' are dealt with in Mishnah [[Nega'im]].\n\n=== Patches of the skin ===\nPatches of the skin are confirmed as ''tzaraath'' by the occurrence of one of three signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:3</ref>\n# white hair (\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df) \u2013 if at least two hairs within the confines of the ''negah'' turn white<ref name=\"lev3-10\">Leviticus 13:10</ref>\n# healthy flesh (\u05d5\u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9) \u2013 if skin of a normal appearance appears within the confines of the patch<ref name=\"lev3-10\"/>\n# spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the patch became enlarged since the time of the initial examination by the Kohen<ref>Leviticus 13:7</ref>\n\nWhereas baldness is not a form of ''tzaraath'', patches that occur on a bald scalp may be ''tzaraath'' if they meet the criteria as mentioned by the Torah. Such an eruption on a bald scalp must appear in a distinct fashion but is regulated by rules similar to that of ''nega'im'' on the skin; however, it can only occur on men. For a scalp eruption to be ''tzaraath'', the lesion must be a white patch tinged with red (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd).<ref>Leviticus 13:42</ref> This can occur in one of two places: within what are referred to as a man's posterior baldness (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea) and anterior baldness (\u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea).\n\nIf someone cuts off some skin or a part of his body to remove a ''negah'', he becomes impure, even if he had no confirming signs. He may become pure only after another ''negah'' forms.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref> The exception is when a ''negah'' appears on the tip of the [[foreskin]] and is cut off during [[circumcision]], which is permitted, because a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\"/>\n\n=== Boils and burns ===\nBoils and burns, as occur naturally as a result of an [[abscess]], blunt force trauma or thermal insult to the skin, are not ''tzaraath'' and do not carry impurity. During the healing phases of these wounds, however, if certain signs that mimic those of the aforementioned patches appear, ''tzaraath'' may occur. Confirmation is by the occurrence of one of two signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:4</ref>\n#white hair (\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05df and \u05e0\u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:20 and 13:25)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 and \u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:22 and 13:27)\n\n=== Bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard ===\nThe initial symptom of this type of ''negah'' is patches of hair loss. According to [[Maimonides]], scalp and beard ''nega'im'' are characterized by hair loss without any change to the skin of the bald spot <ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Mishnah Torah]], ''Taharah'', ''Hilchot Tuma'at Tzaraath'' 8:1</ref> The [[Tosefta]], however, maintains that the skin of the bald spot does indeed become altered in a ''negah''. There are two confirming signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:5</ref>\n#thin yellow hair (\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e7) \u2013 if at least two and a half hairs from within the bald patch turn yellow (Leviticus 13:30)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the balding spreads, according to Maimonides. According to [[Abraham ben David]], who quotes the Tosefta, this spreading would refer to spreading of a skin change as well (Leviticus 13:36).\n\n=== Inspection of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, and ''tzaraath'' determination ===\nFor all of the different types of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, there is a similar protocol put in place by the Torah for determining whether or not the skin eruption is indeed ''tzaraath''. The individual with the eruption must visit a ''[[kohen]]'', who is a male possessing direct lineage to [[Aaron]], who was the [[kohen gadol|High Priest]] and brother of [[Moses]]. The ''kohen'', trained in examining lesions and diagnosing ''tzaraath'', will examine the lesion and determine whether or not it meets the specifications of ''tzaraath''. Specifically, he will evaluate the lesion for the criteria mentioned above, except of course for the final criterion of spreading, which can only be diagnosed at a follow-up examination, should one be necessary. If during the initial examination, the characteristics of the lesion meet the criteria for ''tzaraath'', the ''kohen'' will declare the individual ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). (Leviticus 13:3, 20, 25, 30)\n\nIf the criteria are not met by the lesion during the initial examination by the ''kohen'', the individual is confined in his home for seven days, pending a follow-up examination (Leviticus 13:4, 21, 26, 31) If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' are again not met and the lesion has not spread, there is a difference in protocol depending of the type of lesion.\n* For patches of the skin, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.<ref>Leviticus 13:5,</ref>\n* For boils or burns, the ''kohen'' declares it merely a \u05e6\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea (''tzarevet'', \"scar\") and there are no further examinations (Leviticus 13:23 and 28)\n* For bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, another confinement period of seven days is imposed. However, prior to this second confinement period, the individual is shaved around the ''nesek'' (\u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u2013 \"he should be shaved but the ''nesek'' should not be shaved), leaving a rim of two hairs completely surrounding the bald spot to make any spreading recognizable<ref>Leviticus 13:33 + associated commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> (especially according to Maimonides, who asserts that these lesions manifest as pure hair loss without any concomitant skin eruption.)\n\nAfter the second confinement period of seven days, both those with patches on the skin as well as those with bald patches are re-evaluated once more.<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\">Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref> If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have still not been met, the afflicted individual is declared ''tahor'' (\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \"ritually pure\").<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> He or she, does, however, have to wash both his or her body and garments;<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> due to the confinement, he or she is considered impure in some sense.<ref>Leviticus 13:6, commentary by Rashi</ref>\n\nIf the ''negah'' was declared ritually pure and later it spread, it must be shown once again to a ''kohen'', who will then declare it ''tzaraath''.<ref>Leviticus 13:7\u20138 and 35\u201336</ref>\nThere are many other regulations regarding the inspection:\n* The ''kohen'' must be able to see the entirety of the lesion. Thus, if the skin eruption or bald spot wraps around either the body or body parts, or occurs at the tip of terminal body parts\u2014any place that would preclude the observation of the entire lesion at one time (i.e. wrapping around the torso, scalp or arm, or occurring at the tip of a finger or toe) \u2013 there can be no declaration of ''tzaraath''.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 6:7</ref>\n* In a similar vein, a ''kohen'' who is blind in one eye or who cannot see well may not perform the inspections.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:3</ref> An eligible ''kohen'' may inspect anyone, including his relatives, except himself.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:5</ref> However, it is not necessary that a ''kohen'' perform the inspection; anyone who is proficient in the laws of ''nega'im'' may perform the examination. However, only a ''kohen'' may declare purity or impurity. A non-''kohen'' examiner may inform an accompanying inexpert ''kohen'' of his determination that a ''negah'' is or is not ''tzaraath'' and the ''kohen'' declares \"purity\" or \"impurity\".<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render impurity on parts of the body that are naturally concealed by other parts of the body according to specific regulations. For skin eruptions on the legs, men are inspected standing as though they are hoeing and women standing as though they are rolling dough. For eruptions on the arms, men raise their arms as though they are picking olives and women raising their arms as though they are weaving or spinning.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 2:4\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render [[gentile]]s impure.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\"/>\n* A groom is exempt from visiting the ''kohen'' until the eighth day after his wedding for any ''nega'im'' on his flesh, garments or house. Similarly, there are no inspections carried out on the days of [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] or [[Sukkot]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:2</ref>\n* Even on the days when inspections are performed, they are only allowed for two hours each day: during the fourth and eighth hour of the day (corresponding roughly to 9\u201310 AM and 2\u20133 PM).<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:2</ref>\n\nIf, however, the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have been met, either during the initial exam or at either of the two follow-ups (when applicable) or even after a previous declaration of purity, the individual is declared ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). The individual is declared impure even if the lesion did not worsen or spread but remained the same\u2014the skin eruption must become dimmer in appearance for it to be declared pure at the second follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 + commentary of Rashi</ref>\n\n=== The ''metzora'': management of ''tzaraath'' of human flesh ===\nThe individual who is declared impure with ''tzaraath'' is referred to as either<ref>Leviticus 13:44 and 14:2, respectively</ref> a ''tzarua'' (\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2) or a ''metzora'' (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2). The ''metzora'' is shunned and must live alone outside the confines of the community (Leviticus 13:46) The ''metzora'' tears his or her garments in mourning like those who are in [[sitting shiva|mourning]] for a close family member and does not cut his or her hair.  The ''metzora'' must also cover his or her face until the upper lip in the fashion of mourners, and he or she calls out \"impure, impure\" to warn others to keep their distance ([[Rashi]] Commentary on Leviticus 13:45).\n\nThe ''metzora'' remains confined outside of the community until his ''tzaraath'' vanishes. The ''metzora'' is evaluated by a ''kohen'', who leaves the community to examine him. When the ''kohen'' observes the resolution of the ''tzaraath'', he begins a procedure that ultimately reverses the impure status of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:4).\n\n== Purification ==\n:\"\u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7 \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8 \u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e6\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05e5 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d6 \u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05d6\u05d1\"\n:\"The ''kohen'' shall command to take for the person undergoing purification (the ''metzora'') two live [[kosher]] birds, cedarwood, red string and [[ezov|hyssop]].\"\n\nThe items used in the purification ritual were specifically included to deliver a message to the ''metzora''. Although many sins may lead to this punishment, the most predominant sin to cause ''tzaraath'' is ''[[lashon hara]]'' (an \"evil tongue\",<ref>''[[Talmud#Talmud Bavli .28Babylonian Talmud.29|Bavli]]'' ''[[Arachin]]'' 16b</ref> see [[Tzaraath#Interpretations|Interpretations]] below); to speak derogatorily about others consistently to one's friends is likened to birds, who chatter endlessly (Talmud ''Arachin'' 16b). In a similar vein, the one who speaks ill of others is haughty, holding himself or herself high above others and is likened to the tall [[Cedrus libani|cedar]]. To be healed, the ''metzora'' must erase arrogance, making themselves lowly like a worm. This is a play on words\u2014the word ''tola'as'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea) means both \"red\" and \"worm\" \u2013 as well as hyssop.\n\nSpring water is placed in an earthenware vessel, over which one of the birds is slaughtered and into which the blood is allowed to run. The ''kohen'' then dips the remaining bird and other items into the bloodied water and sprinkles the ''metzora'' seven times on the back of the hand. Some say the sprinkling was done onto his or her forehead.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:1</ref> The identical procedure was performed for a house struck by ''tzaraath'', with the sprinkling done on the [[lintel]]. The slaughtered bird was buried in the presence of the ''metzora'' and the live bird was freed into the open field.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\" />\n\nThe ''metzora'' washes their garments from impurity and [[tonsure|shaves off all their hair]], save for that located in places similar to those in which ''nega'im'' are not subject to impurity (Mishnah Nega'im 2:4) The ''metzora'' then waits for seven days to begin the final steps of his or her purification ceremony (Leviticus 14:8\u20139). On the seventh day, the ''metzora'' again washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and again shaves off all of his or her hair. (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:3) On the eighth day, the ''metzora'' brings three animal sacrifices to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: a sin offering of a female [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and a guilt offering and a burnt offering, both of male lambs (Leviticus 14:10).\n\nBlood from the slaughtered guilt offering was placed on the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:14) The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the ''metzora'' was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds. To reconcile this dilemma, the ''metzora'' stuck these body parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood. The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the ''metzora''. If the ''metzora'' lost any of these body parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:9).\n\n=== The priestly gift ===\nThe remaining portion of the olive oil, called in Hebrew ''log shemen shel metzora'', is retained by the ''kohen'' at the completion of his service. This portion is listed as one of the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]].\n\n== Affliction of clothing ==\n''Tzaraath'' can also afflict garments ([[Leviticus]] 13:47). Garment ''tzaraath'' is relevant to only three materials:\n# [[wool]] (Hebrew \u05e6\u05de\u05e8)\n# [[linen]] (Hebrew \u05e4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd)\n# Two types of [[leather]] are indicated in Leviticus 13:48:\n## unworked leather (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8)\n## finished leather (\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, literally \"all worked leather\")\n\nIn a wool or linen garment, the ''tzaraath'' may appear as a uniformly existing ''negah'' within the material or as a ''negah'' limited to either only the [[weft|woof]] or [[warp (weaving)|warp]] (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1) of the garment (Leviticus 13:48).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to ''tzaraath'' as it applies to clothing:\n* Clothing belonging to a [[gentile]] are insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only sheep's wool is susceptible to a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'', although an even mixture of sheep's wool and another type of wool (camel's wool, for example) can be afflicted.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref> In a similar vein, a mixture of plant fibers containing linen is insusceptible unless it is at least half linen.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\"/>\n* The leather referred to by the Torah does not include the hides of marine animals.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:1</ref>\n* The fabric of wool or linen or leather article cannot be rendered impure by ''tzaraath'' if it is artificially dyed. If, however, the item is naturally colored (such as wool from a black sheep), it can be rendered impure.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:3</ref>\n\n=== Appearance, inspection and management of ''tzaraath'' in clothing ===\n''Tzaraath'' appears in clothing as an intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7 \u2013 ''yerakrak'') or red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd \u2013 ''adamdam'') eruption,<ref>Leviticus 13:49</ref> and must be brought to the ''[[kohen]]'' for inspection. In regards to garment ''tzaraath'', there are no criteria by which it can be declared impure upon initial examination. The garment is confined for seven days, and if on the seventh day, the ''negah'' has spread, it is a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'' and is declared impure.<ref>Leviticus 13:51</ref> Subsequent to a declaration of ''tzaraath'', the garment, whether wool, linen or leather, is completely burnt (\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3); if the ''tzaraath'' was confined to the woof or warp, only that need be burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:52</ref>\n\nUpon re-evaluation after the seven-day confinement, the ''kohen'' may instruct that the garment with the eruption be washed and confined once more for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 13:54</ref> If upon a second re-evaluation after the second seven days of confinement, the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption did not dim and did not spread, the garment is declared impure and must be completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:55</ref>\n\nIf the second re-evaluation reveals a dimming of the eruption, the ''kohen'' tears the area with the eruption from the garment and burns the torn out portion completely.<ref>Leviticus 13:56, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> The torn out area is patched to allow for a reinspection of the area for return of the ''negah''.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref> If, the eruption returns to the patch, there is no confinement period instituted and the entire garment is completely burnt.;<ref>Leviticus 13:57, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> if a ''negah'' reappears on the garment but not on the patch, the garment must be burned but the patch can be saved.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:6</ref> To recapitulate, if the ''negah'' remained as it was after the first week of confinement, it is washed and reconfined. If it remained as it was after the second week of confinement, it is burned.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\"/>\n\nIf, however, upon the second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' disappears, the garment must be immersed in a ''[[mikveh]]'' (\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4, \"ritual bath\") and is then pure.<ref>Leviticus 13:58, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\n== Affliction of housing ==\nThe third and last type of ''tzaraath'' mentioned by the Torah affects buildings.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 14:34</ref> If an individual notices an affliction on his house, he is to inform a ''[[kohen]]''. The ''kohen'' will then command that they empty the house of all of its contents prior to his inspection; this is to prevent further financial loss, because should the house be confined, everything within it became impure as well.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\">Leviticus 14:36</ref>\n\nWhen the ''kohen'' comes to perform the inspection, he looks for lesions on the wall that appear either intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05ea) or intense red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05de\u05ea) and that appear sunken below the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the wall's surface (\u05e9\u05e4\u05dc \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05e8, literally \"lower than the wall\"). If this is what he sees, the ''kohen'' exits the house and confines it for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 14:38</ref>\n\nOn the seventh day, upon re-evaluating the eruption, if the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption has spread beyond what it had been, the afflicted stones are removed, the area around the afflicted stones is scraped and both the removed stones and clay plaster are cast into a place of impurity.<ref>Leviticus 14:40-1</ref> At least two afflicted stones are necessary for removal of any stones and at least two new stones must be used to fill the void.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref> If the afflicted wall is shared by two houses owned by two neighbors, both neighbors must help to remove the afflicted stones, scrape and place the new stones, but only the owner of the house whose interior was afflicted performs the replastering. It is from this ruling that the [[proverb]] ''Oy l'rasha, oy l'scheino'' (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d5, \"Woe to the wicked! Woe to his neighbor!\") originates.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\"/>\n\nThe void is filled with new stones and clay plaster and the house is confined for another seven days. If upon a second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' has returned after new stones have been plastered in, the ''negah'' is deemed ''tzaraath'' and the entire house must be dismantled.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> If the ''negah'' does not return, the house is pronounced pure, and the same purification process mentioned in relation to ''tzaraath'' of human flesh is employed here.\n\nThere are numerous limitations put on the ''tzaraath'' that afflicts houses:\n* The house of a [[gentile]] is insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only houses that possess four walls and four corners are susceptible. Similarly, only those houses that rest on the ground are susceptible, to the exclusion of those that are suspended above ground or are built on a boat.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:1</ref>\n* ''Tzaraath'' only affects houses that are built entirely out of stones, wood and clay plaster. If any of the four walls are built or internally overlaid with [[marble]], natural outcropping of rock, [[brick]] or earthen soil, that wall is insusceptible to ''tzaraath'', and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four walls are susceptible.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:2</ref>\n* Two storey houses are treated as two distinct houses and the beams that serve as the floor of the upper storey and the roof of the lower storey are allowed to remain with whichever house remains.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 13:3</ref>\n* Houses are the only buildings that are susceptible to ''tzaraath'' (not, for example, barns or cattle stalls) and only houses that exist within the region of land originally divided among the 12 tribes, because the verse refers to ''beis eretz achuzaschem'' (\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6\u05ea\u05db\u05dd, \"a house of the land of your inheritance\"); this also excludes houses in [[Jerusalem]], because it was not given as an inheritance to any one tribe, but rather held jointly by all of [[Children of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:4, commentary of [[Pinchas Kehati]]</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n[[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch]] clams that ''tzaraath'' was not to be interpreted as a medical malady, but rather as a spiritual affliction. The verse itself arguably suggests this, as it directs those who find themselves afflicted to seek out a ''Kohen'' (priest) and not a doctor, while the Torah does permit and even encourages those who are in need of medical care to seek treatment from physicians.<ref>[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21:19</ref>\n\nThe Torah's emphasis is clearly on the ''tu{{'}}mah'' (\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \"ritual impurity \") that results from a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' because the verses focus on the ''kohen''{{'}}s declaration of \"unclean\" \u2013 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 (\"The ''kohen'' will see [the eruption] and [declare] him impure\").\n\nThe Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards ''tzaraath'' as a [[punishment]] for [[sin]]; it lists seven possible causes for ''tzaraath'':<ref>[[Talmud]] Arachin 16a</ref>\n* an ''[[lashon hara|evil tongue]]'' (malicious [[gossip]])\n* [[murder]]\n* a vain [[oath]]\n* illicit sexual intercourse\n* [[pride]]\n* [[theft]]\n* [[miser]]ly behavior\n\nOne ''[[midrash]]ic'' source categorically states that ''tzaraath'' only appeared as punishment for ''evil tongue'', while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from ''tzaraath'' only came about through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. In particular, the [[Midrash Rabba]] sees the different types of ''tzaraath'' as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:\n#the first stage in the Rabbah's view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it only required removal of the affected stones for a cure.\n#in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away, and the infection came upon one's clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure.\n#in the third stage of Rabbah's scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person's skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur.\n#in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to dwell alone.\n\nOther [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical writers]] saw ''tzaraath'' of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserliness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside prior to confinement.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> On the other hand, [[Rashi]], basing his view on the [[Leviticus Rabbah]],<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'' 17:6</ref> states that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a reward for the homeowner, arguing that the [[Israelite]] homes had previously been those of [[Canaanites]], who had hidden their valuables in the walls; the ''tzaraath'' required the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there.<ref>Leviticus 14:34, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\nRather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of ''tzaraath'' in the manner of modern doctors, [[classical rabbinical literature]] took an extremely literal view.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the [[Mishnah]] argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered ''tzaraath'';<ref>Nega'im, 8:4</ref> similarly since the biblical text mentions ''tzaraath'' occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate ''tzaraath'', and that if the boil or burn subsequently heals, it still doesn't indicate ''tzaraath'', unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body not previously diseased.<ref>Nega'im, 9:2</ref> The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a [[lentil]], those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those that occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those that occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate ''tzaraath''.<ref>Nega'im 8:1</ref><ref>Nega'im 6:8</ref>\n\nScholars suspect that these descriptions of ''tzaraath'', where it applies to skin conditions, actually refer to a number of different [[dermatology|skin diseases]],<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/><ref name=\"Wycliffe\">''Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1959/JASA3-59Spinka.html Dr. Harold Spinka, M.D.]</ref> which, owing to the undeveloped state of medical science at that period, were not distinguished.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> Of the particular situations that the Priestly Code describes as being ''tzaraath'',\n* the whitening of the skin over the whole body with sores, is considered by scholars to be most indicative of [[psoriasis]] <ref name=\"EncBib\"/><ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\">''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shai A, Vardy D, Zvulunov A |title=[Psoriasis, biblical afflictions and patients' dignity] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=479\u201382, 496 |year=2002 |pmid=12073533 |doi=}}</ref>\n* the spreading of sores is regarded by scholars as most symptomatic of [[impetigo]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n* the spreading of swellings or spots in a burn injury, according to scholars, is most probably a result of [[erysipelas]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n* in regard to subcutaneous disease where the hair has turned white\n** the additional presence of swellings or spots in a burn injury are thought by scholars most likely to be [[Cutaneous leishmaniasis|tropical sore]]s<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n** the additional presence of bodily sores, and swellings or spots where there previously had been a boil, is one of the classical symptoms of [[leprosy]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n** the additional presence of sores on the head or chin is thought by scholars to most probably indicate the presence of [[ringworm]]<ref name=\"EncBib\"/><ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n=== Symptoms of other conditions ===\nIn addition to simple [[rash]]es,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:4\u20136|}}</ref> [[inflammation]]s,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:23|}}</ref> and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28|}}</ref> the Biblical text mentions a number of other conditions that could be confused with ''tzaraath''.

Each victim of ''tzaraas'' mentioned by the Bible is stated to have received the condition due to some transgression of biblical laws,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> including [[Joab]] being cursed for the murder of [[Abner]] (whose blood was shed deceitfully in time of peace), [[Gehazi]] (for 1. rebelling against Elisha's decision to not take payment for a miracle God had worked 2. working deceitfully to take the payment 3. lying to Elisha, saying he hadn't done the thing); and [[Uzziah]] for presuming to burn incense in the Holy Temple\u2014violating a clear and direct Commandment of God (which prohibited anyone besides the priests to burn incense).\n\nIf a person was afflicted with ''tzaraath'' in their skin, they were required to wear torn clothes, keep their hair unkempt, cover the lower part of their face, cry out ''[ritually] impure, [ritually] impure'', and reside away from other people;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:45\u201346}}</ref> a few [[Medical history|medical historians]], such as [[Arturo Castiglioni]], regard this as the first model of sanitary legislation.<ref>Arturo Castiglioni, ''A history of medicine'' (p. 71)</ref> Nevertheless, this isolation isn't necessarily due to concerns over the contagiousness of the disease, but rather due to concerns about the risk of moral corruption to other people; the Talmud doesn't treat ''tzaraath'' as contagious,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> and doesn't consider non-Jewish victims of ''tzaraath'' to be ritually impure.<ref>Nega'im 3:1, 11:1</ref> The Talmud states that if ''tzaraath'' hadn't been confirmed by a [[kohen|Jewish priest]], then a [[bridegroom]] with suspected symptoms of it was allowed to postpone any isolation or inspection by a priest until a week after his [[Jewish wedding|wedding]], and if a person developed suspected symptoms of ''tzaraath'' during a [[Jewish holiday|holy day]], then the isolation and inspection by a priest could be postponed until the holy days had finished.<ref>Nega'im 3:2</ref>\n\nFabrics and clothing affected by ''tzaraath'' were required by the text to be burnt entirely,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:52|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:55|}}</ref> unless it was the form of ''tzaraath'' that faded after washing but came back after being torn out, in which case it could be considered ''ritually pure'' as soon as the ''tzaraath'' had gone, and it had subsequently been washed.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:58|}}</ref> ''Tzaraath'' infections in houses were to be treated similarly harshly according to the biblical regulations, and didn't have any exceptions; stones showing the symptoms had to be removed, and the house had to be scraped, with the removed stones and scraped-off clay being cast into a rubbish heap outside the city,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:40\u201341|}}</ref> and if the infection returned once replacement stones were laid and daubed with clay, then the whole house had to be dismantled, with the rubble again going to the tip outside the city.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:42\u201343|}}</ref> Additionally, people who had been in a house while it was infected with ''tzaraath'' was considered ritually impure until the evening came, and anyone who had eaten or slept there had to also wash their clothes.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:46\u201347|}}</ref>\n\n=== After cure ===\nWhen the priest had certified that ''tzaraath'' had been cured, the biblical text requires that the formerly infected person undergo a number of ritual events,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:1\u20133|}}</ref> some occurring straight away,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20138|}}</ref> and some occurring a week later.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9\u201332|}}</ref> According to critical scholars, these are really two independent rituals spliced together, with the first group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20138|}}, as far as ''...ritually pure''</ref> being the ritual that was originally part of the regulations for ''tzaraath'' of skin, and the other group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\u201332|}}, starting at ''After this...''</ref> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref> The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath'', also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from ''tzaraath'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:49\u201353|}}</ref> however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath''.\n\nThe first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and [[ezov]], into the blood;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20136|}}</ref> this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref> Once the surviving bird was released over open fields,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\"/> and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref> According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of [[sympathetic magic]], with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away;<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\nIn the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people),<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\"/> after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their [[eyebrow]]s, and then wash themselves.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9|}}</ref> Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard [[whole offering]], a standard [[sin offering]] (to excuse the profanity of having had ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>), and a [[guilt offering]] (to apologise for the cause of the ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>);<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:10\u201320|}}</ref> if people are too [[poverty|poor]] to afford that, the Bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used instead.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:21\u201332|}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other guilt offerings, the priest was required to put some of the blood from the sacrifice onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right [[thumb]], and right big [[toe]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:14}}</ref> then some of the oil for the sacrifice had to be poured into the priest's left palm, and applied with the priest's right forefinger onto the formerly infected person's right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:15\u201317}}</ref> and then the rest of the oil from

Similar conclusions were made by [[Reuven Kalisher]], who suggested that [[vitiligo]], as a skin discolorative disease that possesses the trio of characteristics mentioned in the Torah text, is the likely candidate of being one and the same with ''tzaraath''; those three being:\n# non-contagious and\n# cause the hair located within the discolored area to turn white (also known as [[poliosis]] or [[leukotrichia]]) and\n# can grow in size within a week to two-week period.\nThis trio of symptoms is discussed in chapter 13 of the book of [[Leviticus]] as being the tell-tale sign of ''tzaraath''. A near-identical skin discolorative disease has been labeled as vitiligo (also known as leucoderma and [[piebaldism]]). Based on [[rabbinic literature]], it has also been suggested that vitiligo exhibits parallels to the color and hues mentioned in the [[Mishna]] tractate of [[Negaim]] (ch. 1) and is in fact the ''tzaraath'' mentioned in the book of Leviticus.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Yehuda L.

All variations are mainly referred to in chapters 13\u201314 of [[Leviticus]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe noun form comes from the verb ''tzara'' (\u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2) which means \"to have a skin disease.\" The [[root word|linguistic root]] of ''tzaraath'' may mean \"smiting\", in comparison with Arabic, in reference to a Talmudical explanation that it serves as a punishment for [[sin]];<ref name=\"EncBib\">Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref> it is quite possible that ''tzaraath'' was a general term for certain types of skin disease, rather than a particular condition,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> and the [[Talmud]] maintains a similar view, arguing that ''tzaraath'' referred generally to any disease that produces sores and eruptions on the skin.<ref>Sifra 60a</ref>\n\n== Translations ==\nThe [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] [[Torah]] text describes three variations of ''tzaraath'' affecting the skin: \u05e9\u05d0\u05ea, \u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea (Se'eth, Sapachath and Bahereth). The [[Septuagint]], a translation of the Hebrew Bible originally used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] and Gentile [[proselytes]], translates the term ''tzaraath'' with Greek ''lepra'' (\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1), from which the cognate \"[[leprosy]]\" was traditionally used in English Bibles. The classical Greek term ''lepra'' stems from the noun ''lepis'' \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2 (a scale (of a fish), which in turn stems from the verb ''lep\u00f3'' \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 (to peel), hence leprosy (literally, morbid scaliness).<ref>Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon article \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03b1 , Ion. \u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1-\u03c1\u03b7 , \u1f21, (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c2) cites \"A. leprosy, which makes the skin scaly, [[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' 1.138, [[Hippocrates]] ''Aphorisms'' 3.20 (plural), Prorrh.2.43 (pl.), Epid.5.9 (sg.), Morb.1.3 (sg.), Arist.Pr.887a34, [[Theophrastus]] ''Characters'' 19.2, Sud.14, [[LXX]] Leviticus 13.2.</ref> The JPS Tanakh translates it as a \"scaly affection\" in Leviticus 13:2.\n\n''Tzaraath'' is sufficiently dissimilar from leprosy to be considered a different disease altogether, despite its coincidental translation in the Septuagint. For instance, ''tzaraath'' is not contagious between individuals, whereas leprosy is slightly contagious. The ''metzora'' (Hebrew term for one afflicted with ''tzaraath'') is barred from entering Israel's encampment (in the desert) or the city of Jerusalem not because of contagiousness but because of [[Tumah and Taharah|ritual impurity]]. The [[New Testament]] describes instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy ([[Luke 5]]:10), although the precise relationship between this, ''tzaraath'', and Hansen's disease is not established.\n\n== Torah ==\nThe Torah identifies three manifestations of ''tzaraath'': as an affliction of human skin,<ref>Leviticus 13:2</ref> of garments,<ref>Leviticus 13:47</ref> and of houses.<ref>Leviticus 14:34</ref> The Torah also speaks of ''tzaraath'' on two other occasions, one in reference to [[Moses]] and the other in reference to his sister, [[Miriam]]. In Exodus 4:6\u20137, when Moses is standing before the [[burning bush]], he doubts that Jews will believe that he is the messenger of God. God provides him with two signs to prove his mission: turning his rod into a snake and then back into a rod and turning his hand into being stricken with ''tzaraath'' and then back again. Moses revealed these wonders to the elders in Exodus 4:30.\n\nIn Numbers 12:10, Miriam was stricken with ''tzaraath'' for her involvement in slandering Moses. [[Aaron]] asks Moses to cure her via extraordinary means, because he claims that he, as her own brother, cannot examine, confine or purify her. Moses prays for his sister and she is cured of the ''tzaraath'' but must remain in confinement for seven days. The Torah, however, does not indicate that she went through any purification process similar to what is normally required.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some (such as [[ArtScroll|ArtScroll/Mesorah]]) the three subdivisions of skin ''tzaraath'' are best left transliterated, rather than translated, because there are no equivalent English terms and any attempt to translate them greatly diminishes the distinctiveness and focus of the [[Hebrew]] term. Though this is not the view of the [[Jewish Publication Society]] nor of the [[Bible Society]]. Additionally, a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' is not to be performed by anyone but a ''[[kohen]]'' (Jewish priest).\n\nSome say the manifestation of ''tzaraath'' is termed a ''negah'' (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2) \"affliction\", ''nega'im'' (plural: \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd) and there are three varieties of ''nega'im'' that relate to human flesh, two of which are:\n#boils and burns (Leviticus 13:18\u201328)\n#bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, the ''negah'' of which is called a \u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 (''netek'') (Leviticus 13:29\u201344)\n\n== Mishnah ==\nThe laws of ''tzaraath'' are dealt with in Mishnah [[Nega'im]].\n\n=== Patches of the skin ===\nPatches of the skin are confirmed as ''tzaraath'' by the occurrence of one of three signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:3</ref>\n# white hair (\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df) \u2013 if at least two hairs within the confines of the ''negah'' turn white<ref name=\"lev3-10\">Leviticus 13:10</ref>\n# healthy flesh (\u05d5\u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9) \u2013 if skin of a normal appearance appears within the confines of the patch<ref name=\"lev3-10\"/>\n# spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the patch became enlarged since the time of the initial examination by the Kohen<ref>Leviticus 13:7</ref>\n\nWhereas baldness is not a form of ''tzaraath'', patches that occur on a bald scalp may be ''tzaraath'' if they meet the criteria as mentioned by the Torah. Such an eruption on a bald scalp must appear in a distinct fashion but is regulated by rules similar to that of ''nega'im'' on the skin; however, it can only occur on men. For a scalp eruption to be ''tzaraath'', the lesion must be a white patch tinged with red (\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd).<ref>Leviticus 13:42</ref> This can occur in one of two places: within what are referred to as a man's posterior baldness (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d7\u05ea) and anterior baldness (\u05d2\u05d1\u05d7\u05ea).\n\nIf someone cuts off some skin or a part of his body to remove a ''negah'', he becomes impure, even if he had no confirming signs. He may become pure only after another ''negah'' forms.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 7:5</ref> The exception is when a ''negah'' appears on the tip of the [[foreskin]] and is cut off during [[circumcision]], which is permitted, because a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 7:5\"/>\n\n=== Boils and burns ===\nBoils and burns, as occur naturally as a result of an [[abscess]], blunt force trauma or thermal insult to the skin, are not ''tzaraath'' and do not carry impurity. During the healing phases of these wounds, however, if certain signs that mimic those of the aforementioned patches appear, ''tzaraath'' may occur. Confirmation is by the occurrence of one of two signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:4</ref>\n#white hair (\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05dc\u05d1\u05df and \u05e0\u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05d1\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:20 and 13:25)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 and \u05d0\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 similar to that in patches (Leviticus 13:22 and 13:27)\n\n=== Bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard ===\nThe initial symptom of this type of ''negah'' is patches of hair loss. According to [[Maimonides]], scalp and beard ''nega'im'' are characterized by hair loss without any change to the skin of the bald spot <ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Mishnah Torah]], ''Taharah'', ''Hilchot Tuma'at Tzaraath'' 8:1</ref> The [[Tosefta]], however, maintains that the skin of the bald spot does indeed become altered in a ''negah''. There are two confirming signs:<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:5</ref>\n#thin yellow hair (\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5 \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4\u05d1 \u05d3\u05e7) \u2013 if at least two and a half hairs from within the bald patch turn yellow (Leviticus 13:30)\n#spreading (\u05d5\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8) \u2013 if the balding spreads, according to Maimonides. According to [[Abraham ben David]], who quotes the Tosefta, this spreading would refer to spreading of a skin change as well (Leviticus 13:36).\n\n=== Inspection of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, and ''tzaraath'' determination ===\nFor all of the different types of ''nega'im'' of human flesh, there is a similar protocol put in place by the Torah for determining whether or not the skin eruption is indeed ''tzaraath''. The individual with the eruption must visit a ''[[kohen]]'', who is a male possessing direct lineage to [[Aaron]], who was the [[kohen gadol|High Priest]] and brother of [[Moses]]. The ''kohen'', trained in examining lesions and diagnosing ''tzaraath'', will examine the lesion and determine whether or not it meets the specifications of ''tzaraath''. Specifically, he will evaluate the lesion for the criteria mentioned above, except of course for the final criterion of spreading, which can only be diagnosed at a follow-up examination, should one be necessary. If during the initial examination, the characteristics of the lesion meet the criteria for ''tzaraath'', the ''kohen'' will declare the individual ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). (Leviticus 13:3, 20, 25, 30)\n\nIf the criteria are not met by the lesion during the initial examination by the ''kohen'', the individual is confined in his home for seven days, pending a follow-up examination (Leviticus 13:4, 21, 26, 31) If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' are again not met and the lesion has not spread, there is a difference in protocol depending of the type of lesion.\n* For patches of the skin, another confinement period of seven days is imposed.<ref>Leviticus 13:5,</ref>\n* For boils or burns, the ''kohen'' declares it merely a \u05e6\u05e8\u05d1\u05ea (''tzarevet'', \"scar\") and there are no further examinations (Leviticus 13:23 and 28)\n* For bald patches or lesions of the scalp or beard, another confinement period of seven days is imposed. However, prior to this second confinement period, the individual is shaved around the ''nesek'' (\u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d7 \u2013 \"he should be shaved but the ''nesek'' should not be shaved), leaving a rim of two hairs completely surrounding the bald spot to make any spreading recognizable<ref>Leviticus 13:33 + associated commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> (especially according to Maimonides, who asserts that these lesions manifest as pure hair loss without any concomitant skin eruption.)\n\nAfter the second confinement period of seven days, both those with patches on the skin as well as those with bald patches are re-evaluated once more.<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\">Leviticus 13:6 and 34</ref> If the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have still not been met, the afflicted individual is declared ''tahor'' (\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8, \"ritually pure\").<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> He or she, does, however, have to wash both his or her body and garments;<ref name=\"Leviticus 13:6 and 34\"/> due to the confinement, he or she is considered impure in some sense.<ref>Leviticus 13:6, commentary by Rashi</ref>\n\nIf the ''negah'' was declared ritually pure and later it spread, it must be shown once again to a ''kohen'', who will then declare it ''tzaraath''.<ref>Leviticus 13:7\u20138 and 35\u201336</ref>\nThere are many other regulations regarding the inspection:\n* The ''kohen'' must be able to see the entirety of the lesion. Thus, if the skin eruption or bald spot wraps around either the body or body parts, or occurs at the tip of terminal body parts\u2014any place that would preclude the observation of the entire lesion at one time (i.e. wrapping around the torso, scalp or arm, or occurring at the tip of a finger or toe) \u2013 there can be no declaration of ''tzaraath''.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 6:7</ref>\n* In a similar vein, a ''kohen'' who is blind in one eye or who cannot see well may not perform the inspections.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:3</ref> An eligible ''kohen'' may inspect anyone, including his relatives, except himself.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:5</ref> However, it is not necessary that a ''kohen'' perform the inspection; anyone who is proficient in the laws of ''nega'im'' may perform the examination. However, only a ''kohen'' may declare purity or impurity. A non-''kohen'' examiner may inform an accompanying inexpert ''kohen'' of his determination that a ''negah'' is or is not ''tzaraath'' and the ''kohen'' declares \"purity\" or \"impurity\".<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:1</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render impurity on parts of the body that are naturally concealed by other parts of the body according to specific regulations. For skin eruptions on the legs, men are inspected standing as though they are hoeing and women standing as though they are rolling dough. For eruptions on the arms, men raise their arms as though they are picking olives and women raising their arms as though they are weaving or spinning.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 2:4\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:4</ref>\n* ''Nega'im'' do not render [[gentile]]s impure.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 3:1\"/>\n* A groom is exempt from visiting the ''kohen'' until the eighth day after his wedding for any ''nega'im'' on his flesh, garments or house. Similarly, there are no inspections carried out on the days of [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] or [[Sukkot]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 3:2</ref>\n* Even on the days when inspections are performed, they are only allowed for two hours each day: during the fourth and eighth hour of the day (corresponding roughly to 9\u201310 AM and 2\u20133 PM).<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 2:2</ref>\n\nIf, however, the criteria for ''tzaraath'' have been met, either during the initial exam or at either of the two follow-ups (when applicable) or even after a previous declaration of purity, the individual is declared ''[[tumah|tamei]]'' (\u05d8\u05de\u05d0, \"ritually impure\"). The individual is declared impure even if the lesion did not worsen or spread but remained the same\u2014the skin eruption must become dimmer in appearance for it to be declared pure at the second follow-up examination.<ref>Leviticus 13:6 + commentary of Rashi</ref>\n\n=== The ''metzora'': management of ''tzaraath'' of human flesh ===\nThe individual who is declared impure with ''tzaraath'' is referred to as either<ref>Leviticus 13:44 and 14:2, respectively</ref> a ''tzarua'' (\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2) or a ''metzora'' (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2). The ''metzora'' is shunned and must live alone outside the confines of the community (Leviticus 13:46) The ''metzora'' tears his or her garments in mourning like those who are in [[sitting shiva|mourning]] for a close family member and does not cut his or her hair.  The ''metzora'' must also cover his or her face until the upper lip in the fashion of mourners, and he or she calls out \"impure, impure\" to warn others to keep their distance ([[Rashi]] Commentary on Leviticus 13:45).\n\nThe ''metzora'' remains confined outside of the community until his ''tzaraath'' vanishes. The ''metzora'' is evaluated by a ''kohen'', who leaves the community to examine him. When the ''kohen'' observes the resolution of the ''tzaraath'', he begins a procedure that ultimately reverses the impure status of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:4).\n\n== Purification ==\n:\"\u05d5\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7 \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d4\u05e8 \u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e6\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05e5 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d6 \u05d5\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05d6\u05d1\"\n:\"The ''kohen'' shall command to take for the person undergoing purification (the ''metzora'') two live [[kosher]] birds, cedarwood, red string and [[ezov|hyssop]].\"\n\nThe items used in the purification ritual were specifically included to deliver a message to the ''metzora''. Although many sins may lead to this punishment, the most predominant sin to cause ''tzaraath'' is ''[[lashon hara]]'' (an \"evil tongue\",<ref>''[[Talmud#Talmud Bavli .28Babylonian Talmud.29|Bavli]]'' ''[[Arachin]]'' 16b</ref> see [[Tzaraath#Interpretations|Interpretations]] below); to speak derogatorily about others consistently to one's friends is likened to birds, who chatter endlessly (Talmud ''Arachin'' 16b). In a similar vein, the one who speaks ill of others is haughty, holding himself or herself high above others and is likened to the tall [[Cedrus libani|cedar]]. To be healed, the ''metzora'' must erase arrogance, making themselves lowly like a worm. This is a play on words\u2014the word ''tola'as'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05ea) means both \"red\" and \"worm\" \u2013 as well as hyssop.\n\nSpring water is placed in an earthenware vessel, over which one of the birds is slaughtered and into which the blood is allowed to run. The ''kohen'' then dips the remaining bird and other items into the bloodied water and sprinkles the ''metzora'' seven times on the back of the hand. Some say the sprinkling was done onto his or her forehead.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:1</ref> The identical procedure was performed for a house struck by ''tzaraath'', with the sprinkling done on the [[lintel]]. The slaughtered bird was buried in the presence of the ''metzora'' and the live bird was freed into the open field.<ref name=\"MishnahNegaim\" />\n\nThe ''metzora'' washes their garments from impurity and [[tonsure|shaves off all their hair]], save for that located in places similar to those in which ''nega'im'' are not subject to impurity (Mishnah Nega'im 2:4) The ''metzora'' then waits for seven days to begin the final steps of his or her purification ceremony (Leviticus 14:8\u20139). On the seventh day, the ''metzora'' again washes the garments he or she had been wearing from impurity and again shaves off all of his or her hair. (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:3) On the eighth day, the ''metzora'' brings three animal sacrifices to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: a sin offering of a female [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and a guilt offering and a burnt offering, both of male lambs (Leviticus 14:10).\n\nBlood from the slaughtered guilt offering was placed on the right ear, right thumb and right big toe of the ''metzora'' (Leviticus 14:14) The need for this to be done was cause for some complication, because the ''metzora'' was not allowed into Temple grounds prior to his purification process and the blood of the offering was not allowed out of the Temple grounds. To reconcile this dilemma, the ''metzora'' stuck these body parts through the gateway one at a time to receive the blood. The same was done with the oil from the flour offerings of the ''metzora''. If the ''metzora'' lost any of these body parts after he was ready for purification, he could never obtain purification (Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 14:9).\n\n=== The priestly gift ===\nThe remaining portion of the olive oil, called in Hebrew ''log shemen shel metzora'', is retained by the ''kohen'' at the completion of his service. This portion is listed as one of the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]].\n\n== Affliction of clothing ==\n''Tzaraath'' can also afflict garments ([[Leviticus]] 13:47). Garment ''tzaraath'' is relevant to only three materials:\n# [[wool]] (Hebrew \u05e6\u05de\u05e8)\n# [[linen]] (Hebrew \u05e4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd)\n# Two types of [[leather]] are indicated in Leviticus 13:48:\n## unworked leather (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8)\n## finished leather (\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8, literally \"all worked leather\")\n\nIn a wool or linen garment, the ''tzaraath'' may appear as a uniformly existing ''negah'' within the material or as a ''negah'' limited to either only the [[weft|woof]] or [[warp (weaving)|warp]] (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1) of the garment (Leviticus 13:48).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to ''tzaraath'' as it applies to clothing:\n* Clothing belonging to a [[gentile]] are insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only sheep's wool is susceptible to a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'', although an even mixture of sheep's wool and another type of wool (camel's wool, for example) can be afflicted.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:2</ref> In a similar vein, a mixture of plant fibers containing linen is insusceptible unless it is at least half linen.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:2\"/>\n* The leather referred to by the Torah does not include the hides of marine animals.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:1</ref>\n* The fabric of wool or linen or leather article cannot be rendered impure by ''tzaraath'' if it is artificially dyed. If, however, the item is naturally colored (such as wool from a black sheep), it can be rendered impure.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:3</ref>\n\n=== Appearance, inspection and management of ''tzaraath'' in clothing ===\n''Tzaraath'' appears in clothing as an intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7 \u2013 ''yerakrak'') or red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05dd \u2013 ''adamdam'') eruption,<ref>Leviticus 13:49</ref> and must be brought to the ''[[kohen]]'' for inspection. In regards to garment ''tzaraath'', there are no criteria by which it can be declared impure upon initial examination. The garment is confined for seven days, and if on the seventh day, the ''negah'' has spread, it is a ''negah'' of ''tzaraath'' and is declared impure.<ref>Leviticus 13:51</ref> Subsequent to a declaration of ''tzaraath'', the garment, whether wool, linen or leather, is completely burnt (\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3); if the ''tzaraath'' was confined to the woof or warp, only that need be burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:52</ref>\n\nUpon re-evaluation after the seven-day confinement, the ''kohen'' may instruct that the garment with the eruption be washed and confined once more for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 13:54</ref> If upon a second re-evaluation after the second seven days of confinement, the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption did not dim and did not spread, the garment is declared impure and must be completely burnt.<ref>Leviticus 13:55</ref>\n\nIf the second re-evaluation reveals a dimming of the eruption, the ''kohen'' tears the area with the eruption from the garment and burns the torn out portion completely.<ref>Leviticus 13:56, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> The torn out area is patched to allow for a reinspection of the area for return of the ''negah''.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:5</ref> If, the eruption returns to the patch, there is no confinement period instituted and the entire garment is completely burnt.;<ref>Leviticus 13:57, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref> if a ''negah'' reappears on the garment but not on the patch, the garment must be burned but the patch can be saved.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 11:6</ref> To recapitulate, if the ''negah'' remained as it was after the first week of confinement, it is washed and reconfined. If it remained as it was after the second week of confinement, it is burned.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 11:5\"/>\n\nIf, however, upon the second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' disappears, the garment must be immersed in a ''[[mikveh]]'' (\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4, \"ritual bath\") and is then pure.<ref>Leviticus 13:58, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\n== Affliction of housing ==\nThe third and last type of ''tzaraath'' mentioned by the Torah affects buildings.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 14:34</ref> If an individual notices an affliction on his house, he is to inform a ''[[kohen]]''. The ''kohen'' will then command that they empty the house of all of its contents prior to his inspection; this is to prevent further financial loss, because should the house be confined, everything within it became impure as well.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\">Leviticus 14:36</ref>\n\nWhen the ''kohen'' comes to perform the inspection, he looks for lesions on the wall that appear either intense green (\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05ea) or intense red (\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d3\u05de\u05ea) and that appear sunken below the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the wall's surface (\u05e9\u05e4\u05dc \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05e7\u05d9\u05e8, literally \"lower than the wall\"). If this is what he sees, the ''kohen'' exits the house and confines it for seven days.<ref>Leviticus 14:38</ref>\n\nOn the seventh day, upon re-evaluating the eruption, if the ''kohen'' sees that the eruption has spread beyond what it had been, the afflicted stones are removed, the area around the afflicted stones is scraped and both the removed stones and clay plaster are cast into a place of impurity.<ref>Leviticus 14:40-1</ref> At least two afflicted stones are necessary for removal of any stones and at least two new stones must be used to fill the void.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\">Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:6</ref> If the afflicted wall is shared by two houses owned by two neighbors, both neighbors must help to remove the afflicted stones, scrape and place the new stones, but only the owner of the house whose interior was afflicted performs the replastering. It is from this ruling that the [[proverb]] ''Oy l'rasha, oy l'scheino'' (\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d5, \"Woe to the wicked! Woe to his neighbor!\") originates.<ref name=\"Mishnah Nega'im 12:6\"/>\n\nThe void is filled with new stones and clay plaster and the house is confined for another seven days. If upon a second re-evaluation, the ''negah'' has returned after new stones have been plastered in, the ''negah'' is deemed ''tzaraath'' and the entire house must be dismantled.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> If the ''negah'' does not return, the house is pronounced pure, and the same purification process mentioned in relation to ''tzaraath'' of human flesh is employed here.\n\nThere are numerous limitations put on the ''tzaraath'' that afflicts houses:\n* The house of a [[gentile]] is insusceptible to ''tzaraath''.\n* Only houses that possess four walls and four corners are susceptible. Similarly, only those houses that rest on the ground are susceptible, to the exclusion of those that are suspended above ground or are built on a boat.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:1</ref>\n* ''Tzaraath'' only affects houses that are built entirely out of stones, wood and clay plaster. If any of the four walls are built or internally overlaid with [[marble]], natural outcropping of rock, [[brick]] or earthen soil, that wall is insusceptible to ''tzaraath'', and a house cannot be rendered impure unless all four walls are susceptible.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:2</ref>\n* Two storey houses are treated as two distinct houses and the beams that serve as the floor of the upper storey and the roof of the lower storey are allowed to remain with whichever house remains.<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 13:3</ref>\n* Houses are the only buildings that are susceptible to ''tzaraath'' (not, for example, barns or cattle stalls) and only houses that exist within the region of land originally divided among the 12 tribes, because the verse refers to ''beis eretz achuzaschem'' (\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d6\u05ea\u05db\u05dd, \"a house of the land of your inheritance\"); this also excludes houses in [[Jerusalem]], because it was not given as an inheritance to any one tribe, but rather held jointly by all of [[Children of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Mishnah ''Nega'im'' 12:4, commentary of [[Pinchas Kehati]]</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n[[Samson Raphael Hirsch|Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch]] clams that ''tzaraath'' was not to be interpreted as a medical malady, but rather as a spiritual affliction. The verse itself arguably suggests this, as it directs those who find themselves afflicted to seek out a ''Kohen'' (priest) and not a doctor, while the Torah does permit and even encourages those who are in need of medical care to seek treatment from physicians.<ref>[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21:19</ref>\n\nThe Torah's emphasis is clearly on the ''tu{{'}}mah'' (\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d4, \"ritual impurity \") that results from a diagnosis of ''tzaraath'' because the verses focus on the ''kohen''{{'}}s declaration of \"unclean\" \u2013 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05d5\u05d8\u05de\u05d0 \u05d0\u05ea\u05d5 (\"The ''kohen'' will see [the eruption] and [declare] him impure\").\n\nThe Talmud, and the majority of historic Jewish literature in general, regards ''tzaraath'' as a [[punishment]] for [[sin]]; it lists seven possible causes for ''tzaraath'':<ref>[[Talmud]] Arachin 16a</ref>\n* an ''[[lashon hara|evil tongue]]'' (malicious [[gossip]])\n* [[murder]]\n* a vain [[oath]]\n* illicit sexual intercourse\n* [[pride]]\n* [[theft]]\n* [[miser]]ly behavior\n\nOne ''[[midrash]]ic'' source categorically states that ''tzaraath'' only appeared as punishment for ''evil tongue'', while others add further reasons to the list in the Talmud. Unlike the modern medical approach, which seeks to cure by natural means, the classical Jewish sources argue that cure from ''tzaraath'' only came about through [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] and forgiveness. In particular, the [[Midrash Rabba]] sees the different types of ''tzaraath'' as increasing levels of punishment, which could be curtailed at any stage if repentance was made:\n#the first stage in the Rabbah's view was the infection of homes, and if repentance came here it only required removal of the affected stones for a cure.\n#in the second stage, the entire house must be torn down as the ''tzaraath'' would not go away, and the infection came upon one's clothes; if repentance came here it required only washing of the clothes for a cure.\n#in the third stage of Rabbah's scheme, the clothes must be burnt, and the infection enters the person's skin; if repentance occurs here then purification could occur.\n#in the fourth stage, which only occurs when the person has completely refused to repent, the person is forced to dwell alone.\n\nOther [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical writers]] saw ''tzaraath'' of houses as having a practical benefit. According to one, as well as being a punishment for miserliness, it also demonstrated that the house owner was lying, if they had said they did not own certain objects neighbours had asked to borrow, since the biblical regulations require the house owner to take all their possessions outside prior to confinement.<ref name=\"Leviticus 14:36\"/> On the other hand, [[Rashi]], basing his view on the [[Leviticus Rabbah]],<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'' 17:6</ref> states that ''tzaraath'' of houses was a reward for the homeowner, arguing that the [[Israelite]] homes had previously been those of [[Canaanites]], who had hidden their valuables in the walls; the ''tzaraath'' required the house owner to remove the bricks, and so find the treasures hidden there.<ref>Leviticus 14:34, commentary of [[Rashi]]</ref>\n\nRather than following the biblical descriptions of the symptoms of ''tzaraath'' in the manner of modern doctors, [[classical rabbinical literature]] took an extremely literal view.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> In the group of symptoms where the hair of the inflicted region has turned white, the [[Mishnah]] argues that plucking out the white hair was all that was required for the disease not to be considered ''tzaraath'';<ref>Nega'im, 8:4</ref> similarly since the biblical text mentions ''tzaraath'' occurring where boils had previously healed, but not where unhealed boils exist, the Mishnah maintains that the appearance of the other symptoms in an unhealed boil or burn do not indicate ''tzaraath'', and that if the boil or burn subsequently heals, it still doesn't indicate ''tzaraath'', unless the other symptoms occur in parts of the body not previously diseased.<ref>Nega'im, 9:2</ref> The Mishnah also argues that sores smaller than the size of a [[lentil]], those on the extremities of the body (such as the fingers, toes, ears, nose, breasts, etc.), those that occur in the location of an unhealed boil or burn, and those that occur in hairy parts of the body, do not indicate ''tzaraath''.<ref>Nega'im 8:1</ref><ref>Nega'im 6:8</ref>\n\nScholars suspect that these descriptions of ''tzaraath'', where it applies to skin conditions, actually refer to a number of different [[dermatology|skin diseases]],<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/><ref name=\"Wycliffe\">''Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1959/JASA3-59Spinka.html Dr. Harold Spinka, M.D.]</ref> which, owing to the undeveloped state of medical science at that period, were not distinguished.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> Of the particular situations that the Priestly Code describes as being ''tzaraath'',\n* the whitening of the skin over the whole body with sores, is considered by scholars to be most indicative of [[psoriasis]] <ref name=\"EncBib\"/><ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\">''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shai A, Vardy D, Zvulunov A |title=[Psoriasis, biblical afflictions and patients' dignity] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=479\u201382, 496 |year=2002 |pmid=12073533 |doi=}}</ref>\n* the spreading of sores is regarded by scholars as most symptomatic of [[impetigo]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n* the spreading of swellings or spots in a burn injury, according to scholars, is most probably a result of [[erysipelas]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n* in regard to subcutaneous disease where the hair has turned white\n** the additional presence of swellings or spots in a burn injury are thought by scholars most likely to be [[Cutaneous leishmaniasis|tropical sore]]s<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n** the additional presence of bodily sores, and swellings or spots where there previously had been a boil, is one of the classical symptoms of [[leprosy]]<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n** the additional presence of sores on the head or chin is thought by scholars to most probably indicate the presence of [[ringworm]]<ref name=\"EncBib\"/><ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\n=== Symptoms of other conditions ===\nIn addition to simple [[rash]]es,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:4\u20136|}}</ref> [[inflammation]]s,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:23|}}</ref> and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:28|}}</ref> the Biblical text mentions a number of other conditions that could be confused with ''tzaraath''.

Each victim of ''tzaraas'' mentioned by the Bible is stated to have received the condition due to some transgression of biblical laws,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> including [[Joab]] being cursed for the murder of [[Abner]] (whose blood was shed deceitfully in time of peace), [[Gehazi]] (for 1. rebelling against Elisha's decision to not take payment for a miracle God had worked 2. working deceitfully to take the payment 3. lying to Elisha, saying he hadn't done the thing); and [[Uzziah]] for presuming to burn incense in the Holy Temple\u2014violating a clear and direct Commandment of God (which prohibited anyone besides the priests to burn incense).\n\nIf a person was afflicted with ''tzaraath'' in their skin, they were required to wear torn clothes, keep their hair unkempt, cover the lower part of their face, cry out ''[ritually] impure, [ritually] impure'', and reside away from other people;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:45\u201346}}</ref> a few [[Medical history|medical historians]], such as [[Arturo Castiglioni]], regard this as the first model of sanitary legislation.<ref>Arturo Castiglioni, ''A history of medicine'' (p. 71)</ref> Nevertheless, this isolation isn't necessarily due to concerns over the contagiousness of the disease, but rather due to concerns about the risk of moral corruption to other people; the Talmud doesn't treat ''tzaraath'' as contagious,<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> and doesn't consider non-Jewish victims of ''tzaraath'' to be ritually impure.<ref>Nega'im 3:1, 11:1</ref> The Talmud states that if ''tzaraath'' hadn't been confirmed by a [[kohen|Jewish priest]], then a [[bridegroom]] with suspected symptoms of it was allowed to postpone any isolation or inspection by a priest until a week after his [[Jewish wedding|wedding]], and if a person developed suspected symptoms of ''tzaraath'' during a [[Jewish holiday|holy day]], then the isolation and inspection by a priest could be postponed until the holy days had finished.<ref>Nega'im 3:2</ref>\n\nFabrics and clothing affected by ''tzaraath'' were required by the text to be burnt entirely,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:52|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:55|}}</ref> unless it was the form of ''tzaraath'' that faded after washing but came back after being torn out, in which case it could be considered ''ritually pure'' as soon as the ''tzaraath'' had gone, and it had subsequently been washed.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|13:58|}}</ref> ''Tzaraath'' infections in houses were to be treated similarly harshly according to the biblical regulations, and didn't have any exceptions; stones showing the symptoms had to be removed, and the house had to be scraped, with the removed stones and scraped-off clay being cast into a rubbish heap outside the city,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:40\u201341|}}</ref> and if the infection returned once replacement stones were laid and daubed with clay, then the whole house had to be dismantled, with the rubble again going to the tip outside the city.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:42\u201343|}}</ref> Additionally, people who had been in a house while it was infected with ''tzaraath'' was considered ritually impure until the evening came, and anyone who had eaten or slept there had to also wash their clothes.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:46\u201347|}}</ref>\n\n=== After cure ===\nWhen the priest had certified that ''tzaraath'' had been cured, the biblical text requires that the formerly infected person undergo a number of ritual events,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:1\u20133|}}</ref> some occurring straight away,<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20138|}}</ref> and some occurring a week later.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9\u201332|}}</ref> According to critical scholars, these are really two independent rituals spliced together, with the first group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20138|}}, as far as ''...ritually pure''</ref> being the ritual that was originally part of the regulations for ''tzaraath'' of skin, and the other group<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\u201332|}}, starting at ''After this...''</ref> being a later attempt at replacing the first group of rituals, so that the regulations fitted better with the sacrifice-centric view of the Aaronid priesthood.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref> The biblical text states that a ritual, almost identical to the first group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath'', also had to be carried out for houses that had been cured of infections from ''tzaraath'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:49\u201353|}}</ref> however, there is no further ritual for houses that could parallel the second group of rituals for skin-''tzaraath''.\n\nThe first group of requirements are that the formerly infected person kills a (ritually pure) bird over fresh water, in a clay pot, and dips another living bird, together with cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and [[ezov]], into the blood;<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:4\u20136|}}</ref> this combination was used to sprinkle the formerly infected person seven times with the blood.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7|}}</ref> Once the surviving bird was released over open fields,<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:7\"/> and the formerly infected person had shaved off all their hair, and bathed themselves and their clothes in water, they were counted as ritually pure.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\">{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8|}}</ref> According to biblical scholars, this ritual is primarily an example of [[sympathetic magic]], with the running water and living bird being symbolic representations of ritual impurity going away;<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> killing animals over running water was a widespread ancient custom.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/> The cedar and ezob have more practical applications, with cedarwood having medicinal properties, and ezob being a good implement to use for sprinkling.<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>\n\nIn the second group of requirements, having completed the first group, the formerly infected person is required to avoid their own home for a week (although they may mix with other people),<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8\"/> after which they must shave off absolutely all of their hair, including their [[eyebrow]]s, and then wash themselves.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:9|}}</ref> Having done this, the formerly infected individual was required to make a standard [[whole offering]], a standard [[sin offering]] (to excuse the profanity of having had ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>), and a [[guilt offering]] (to apologise for the cause of the ''tzaraath''<ref name=\"Peake's commentary on the Bible\"/>);<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:10\u201320|}}</ref> if people are too [[poverty|poor]] to afford that, the Bible allows the standard alternative set of sacrificial victims to be used

Similar conclusions were made by [[Reuven Kalisher]], who suggested that [[vitiligo]], as a skin discolorative disease that possesses the trio of characteristics mentioned in the Torah text, is the likely candidate of being one and the same with ''tzaraath''; those three being:\n# non-contagious and\n# cause the hair located within the discolored area to turn white (also known as [[poliosis]] or [[leukotrichia]]) and\n# can grow in size within a week to two-week period.\nThis trio of symptoms is discussed in chapter 13 of the book of [[Leviticus]] as being the tell-tale sign of ''tzaraath''. A near-identical skin discolorative disease has been labeled as vitiligo (also known as leucoderma and [[piebaldism]]). Based on [[rabbinic literature]], it has also been suggested that vitiligo exhibits parallels to the color and hues mentioned in the [[Mishna]] tractate of [[Negaim]] (ch. 1) and is in fact the ''tzaraath'' mentioned in the book of Leviticus.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Yehuda L.

The complex also has two large hotels, the Delta Ottawa City Centre (410 rooms) and [[Ottawa Marriott Hotel]] (487 rooms). The buildings are linked by an underground shopping complex.

Towers A and B are located on the south side of Queen Street while tower C is on the north of Queen. The buildings are mostly home to various federal government workers, with the [[Department of Transport (Canada)|Department of Transport]], headquartered in Tower C, being the largest tenant.\n\nFor almost a century the area had been home to the city's [[streetcar]] garages. The streetcar system was closed in 1959. The land was purchased later by developer [[Robert Campeau]]. He conceived an ambitious plan to recentre Ottawa's downtown on the site.  The scheme faced several barriers, the most important of which was that for many years buildings in downtown Ottawa faced a 45.7 metre (150&nbsp;foot) height restriction so the [[Peace Tower]] would dominate the skyline. Despite strong opposition from Ottawa mayor [[Charlotte Whitton]], the rule was changed to allow the only somewhat taller Towers A and B to be constructed. These two towers were completed in 1968. That same year Campeau began lobbying to build the much taller Tower C. Originally hoping to build a 145-metre (475&nbsp;foot) tower (which would have made it about 42 storeys), although approved by the city, the [[National Capital Commission]] allowed it to only be 112 metres (367&nbsp;feet) (29 storeys), but it was, and remains, the tallest building in the city.\n\nIn the early 1980s Campeau proposed building a fourth even taller tower but a deep recession and a glut of Ottawa office space ended these plans. The buildings also began to suffer a variety of problems including [[asbestos]], [[Mold (fungus)|mould]], a fire and allegations of [[Sick Building Syndrome]]. In the late 1980s Towers A and B were gutted and completely renovated. Campeau's business empire was also struggling and after failed expansion attempts in the United States his company collapsed.  In 1996 its remnants, including Place de Ville, were bought by the Reichmann's [[Olympia and York]] (O&Y).\n\nIn 2000 O&Y announced that work would begin on a third phase of the Place de Ville complex.  This would consist of two new towers one 18 storeys and the other 12.  They would be built on the large parking lot across from Tower B.  Several other downtown building projects and another economic downturn put these plans on hold, however.  In February 2005 O&Y announced it would be selling most of its Canadian holdings, including Place de Ville.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nSince September 14, 2019, the complex is directly linked to [[Lyon Station]] of the [[Confederation Line]] which is situated underground between the two phases of Place de Ville. One entrance is integrated into the south fa\u00e7ade of the Podium building, while a second entrance can be found within the underground shopping concourse. \n\nThe complex boasts the city's largest underground parking garage with space for 974 cars.\n\n==Future developments==\n\nPlace de Ville is now managed by [[Brookfield Properties]]. Plans have been filed with the City of Ottawa to replace the 4 storey 'Podium' building with a 19 floor office tower. A two storey link would connect tower C with this new building and include wider, brighter escalators to the underground concourse.\n\nBrookfield also owns a large surface parking lot taking up half a block across Kent Street from Place de Ville phase I that could see construction of over half a million square feet of office space. The parking lot will be partially closed during the construction of the Confederation Line to allow the builders to use the lot as a staging area and a central point from which to dig the downtown subway portion of the system.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of tallest buildings in Ottawa-Gatineau]]\n*[[Confederation Line]]\n*[[Underground City]]\n*[[Robert Campeau]]\n*[[Brookfield Properties]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/building/detail.cfm?BID=222&RID=250 Place de Ville I - BPO Properties]\n*[http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/building/detail.cfm?BID=222&RID=250 Place de Ville II - BPO Properties]\n*[http://app01.ottawa.ca/postingplans/appDetails.jsf?lang=en&appId=__7TBR2F]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Place De Ville}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Skyscrapers in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:International style architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Brookfield Properties buildings]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Canada]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper hotels in Canada]]\n[[Category:Retail buildings in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox building\n| name               = Place de Ville\n| image              = Place de Ville C.JPG\n| image_size         = \n| caption            = Tower C of Place de Ville\n| location           = Lyon and Queen Street<br>[[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| coordinates        = {{coord|45.4194|-75.7045|region:CA-ON|display=inline,title}}\n| map_type           = Canada Ontario\n| start_date         = 1965\n| completion_date    = 1972\n| building_type      = Commercial offices and hotels\n| antenna_spire      = None\n| roof               = Tower A: {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}}<br> Tower B: {{convert|87|m|abbr=on}}<br> Tower C: {{convert|112|m|abbr=on}}<br> Delta Hotel: {{convert|91|m|abbr=on}}<br> Marriott Hotel: {{convert|96|m|abbr=on}}\n| top_floor          = 29\n| floor_count        = Tower A: 22<br> Tower B: 22<br> Tower C: 29<br> Delta Hotel: 25<br> Marriott Hotel: 26\n| elevator_count     = Tower A: 6<br> Tower B: 6<br> Tower C: 12\n| rooms              = Delta: 411<br> Marriott: 486 \n| floor_area         = {{convert|1200000|sqft|abbr=on}}\n| structural_engineer= \n| main_contractor    = [[Campeau Corporation]]\n| developer          = [[Campeau Corporation]]\n| owner              = [[Brookfield Properties]]\n| management         = [[Brookfield Properties]]\n| references         = <ref>http://brookfieldofficeproperties.com/content/portfolio-2904.html#/CanadaMarkets/Ottawa</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Place de Ville''' is a complex of [[office tower]]s in [[Downtown Ottawa|downtown]] [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The buildings are mostly home to various federal government workers, with the [[Department of Transport (Canada)|Department of Transport]], headquartered in Tower C, being the largest tenant.\n\nFor almost a century the area had been home to the city's [[streetcar]] garages. The streetcar system was closed in 1959. The land was purchased later by developer [[Robert Campeau]]. He conceived an ambitious plan to recentre Ottawa's downtown on the site.  The scheme faced several barriers, the most important of which was that for many years buildings in downtown Ottawa faced a 45.7 metre (150&nbsp;foot) height restriction so the [[Peace Tower]] would dominate the skyline. Despite strong opposition from Ottawa mayor [[Charlotte Whitton]], the rule was changed to allow the only somewhat taller Towers A and B to be constructed. These two towers were completed in 1968. That same year Campeau began lobbying to build the much taller Tower C. Originally hoping to build a 145-metre (475&nbsp;foot) tower (which would have made it about 42 storeys), although approved by the city, the [[National Capital Commission]] allowed it to only be 112 metres (367&nbsp;feet) (29 storeys), but it was, and remains, the tallest building in the city.\n\nIn the early 1980s Campeau proposed building a fourth even taller tower but a deep recession and a glut of Ottawa office space ended these plans. The buildings also began to suffer a variety of problems including [[asbestos]], [[mould]], a fire and allegations of [[Sick Building Syndrome]]. In the late 1980s Towers A and B were gutted and completely renovated. Campeau's business empire was also struggling and after failed expansion attempts in the United States his company collapsed.  In 1996 its remnants, including Place de Ville, were bought by the Reichmann's [[Olympia and York]] (O&Y).\n\nIn 2000 O&Y announced that work would begin on a third phase of the Place de Ville complex.  This would consist of two new towers one 18 storeys and the other 12.  They would be built on the large parking lot across from Tower B.  Several other downtown building projects and another economic downturn put these plans on hold, however.  In February 2005 O&Y announced it would be selling most of its Canadian holdings, including Place de Ville.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nSince September 14, 2019, the complex is directly linked to [[Lyon Station]] of the [[Confederation Line]] which is situated underground between the two phases of Place de Ville. One entrance is integrated into the south fa\u00e7ade of the Podium building, while a second entrance can be found within the underground shopping concourse. \n\nThe complex boasts the city's largest underground parking garage with space for 974 cars.\n\n==Future developments==\n\nPlace de Ville is now managed by [[Brookfield Properties]]. Plans have been filed with the City of Ottawa to replace the 4 storey 'Podium' building with a 19 floor office tower. A two storey link would connect tower C with this new building and include wider, brighter escalators to the underground concourse.\n\nBrookfield also owns a large surface parking lot taking up half a block across Kent Street from Place de Ville phase I that could see construction of over half a million square feet of office space. The parking lot will be partially closed during the construction of the Confederation Line to allow the builders to use the lot as a staging area and a central point from which to dig the downtown subway portion of the system.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of tallest buildings in Ottawa-Gatineau]]\n*[[Confederation Line]]\n*[[Underground City]]\n*[[Robert Campeau]]\n*[[Brookfield Properties]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/building/detail.cfm?BID=222&RID=250 Place de Ville I - BPO Properties]\n*[http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/building/detail.cfm?BID=222&RID=250 Place de Ville II - BPO Properties]\n*[http://app01.ottawa.ca/postingplans/appDetails.jsf?lang=en&appId=__7TBR2F]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Place De Ville}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Skyscrapers in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:International style architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Brookfield Properties buildings]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Canada]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper hotels in Canada]]\n[[Category:Retail buildings in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_Ville"}

Trains]].<ref name=AT1 /> They are [[electric multiple unit]]s using [[Fiat Ferroviaria]]'s [[tilting train]] [[Pendolino]] technology and built by [[Alstom]]. Fifty-three units were originally built between 2001 and 2004 for operation on the [[West Coast Main Line]] (WCML). The 8-car units were all later lengthened to 9 cars, then an additional four trains and also a further 62 cars were built between 2009 and 2012. The trains of the original batch were the last to be assembled at Alstom's [[Washwood Heath]] plant, before its closure in 2005. The remaining trains in the fleet were built in Italy.\n\nThe Class 390 ''Pendolino'' is one of the fastest domestic electric multiple units operating in Britain, with a design speed of {{cvt|140|mph|0}}; however, limitations to track signalling systems restrict the trains to a maximum speed of {{cvt|125|mph|-1}} in service. In September 2006, the Pendolino set a new speed record, completing the {{cvt|401|mi|adj=on}} length of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Glasgow Central to London Euston in 3&nbsp;hours, 55&nbsp;minutes, beating the 4-hour-14-minute record for the southbound run previously set in 1981 by its ancestor, [[British Rail]]'s [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT). The APT retains the ultimate speed record for this route, having completed the northbound journey between London Euston and Glasgow Central in 3&nbsp;hours 52&nbsp;minutes in 1984, which included a five-minute delay due to a signal fault.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5369808.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title= Virgin train breaks speed record |date=22 September 2006 |access-date=2 December 2015  |quote=Virgin Trains made the 401 mile journey in three hours and 55 minutes - knocking 19 minutes off the record set 25 years ago}}</ref> The fleet is maintained at [[Longsight Electric TMD|Longsight TMD]] near {{Stnlnk|Manchester Piccadilly}} station.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:390001 First Class Internal.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of First Class]]\n\nDuring 1997, private operator [[Virgin Rail Group]] started operating the [[InterCity West Coast]] franchise, taking over from state-owned operator [[British Rail]]. Virgin had been awarded the franchise having made a commitment to replace the locomotives and rolling stock in use on the route, namely the [[British Rail Class 86]], [[British Rail Class 87|87]] and [[British Rail Class 90|90]] [[electric locomotive]]s and [[British Rail Mark 2|Mark 2]] and [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaching stock, with brand new [[tilting train]]s. Following negotiations with several manufacturers, Virgin placed an order with [[Alstom]]/[[Fiat Ferroviaria]] to produce the envisioned tilting train, which was known by the name ''Pendolino'' and was later designated under [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification#1973 numbering and classification - TOPS|TOPS]] as the ''Class 390''.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe purpose of tilt on the Pendolino was to maintain passenger comfort levels when traversing curves at high speed by reducing the sideways forces on the train's occupants, minimising their tendency to slide across the carriage.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The train was designed to be visually impressive: the concept design for the Pendolino was originally produced by industrial design firm Priestman Goode in cooperation with JHL and Start Design and many aspects of the finished product, such as the shaping of its aerodynamic nose and much of the train's interior areas, can be attributed to them.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe concept of deploying tilting trains on the [[West Coast Main Line]] was not an original one. During the 1980s and 1990s, British Rail had developed several plans to introduce new trains and pursued the development of the revolutionary, but ultimately unsuccessful, [[British Rail Class 370|Class 370]] [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT) for a protracted period.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Some years after the cancellation of the APT, British Rail had intended to replace the existing fleet of trains on the West Coast Main Line (in conjunction with a planned route modernisation) as part of the [[InterCity 250]] project, but this was cancelled by the government shortly before the [[Privatisation of British Rail]] during the late 1990s.\n\nThe original Pendolino order was for 54 nine-carriage sets, costing \u00a3500 million.<ref name = \"knig 2000\"/> As originally planned, a pre-series test train was scheduled to be completed and to be in active testing by July 2000, while the first Pendolino was to enter revenue service during March 2001. It was expected that the whole fleet would be delivered by May 2002.<ref name=\"knig 2000\">{{cite magazine |last=Knight |first=Stephen |url=https://railm.blob.core.windows.net/website/1/rail-archive/rail-345.pdf |title=Virgin's first West Coast tilt train 'on test by July 2000' |magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP Apex Publications]] |issn=09534563 |oclc=49953699 |date=2 December 1998 |issue=345 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520054904/https://railm.blob.core.windows.net/website/1/rail-archive/rail-345.pdf |archive-date=20 May 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Pendolinos were intended to run at service speeds of up to {{cvt|140|mph|0}}. Railtrack, therefore, embarked on a modernisation of the West Coast Main Line to allow for the faster line speeds.<ref name = \"knig 2000\"/> However, the programme ran into serious difficulties. By its end, it was almost four times over-budget, had been delayed by a number of years, and had not improved the infrastructure as much as had been planned. Consequently, and in a manner reminiscent of the introduction of the [[InterCity 225]], the lack of signalling upgrades resulted in the maximum line speed being set at {{cvt|125|mph|-1}}. Although the Pendolino's in-service top speed is well below British Rail's hopes for the APT, which was to reach up to {{cvt|155|mph|-1}}, it does match the maximum speed of {{cvt|125|mph|-1}} for the APT in passenger service.\n\nFiat Ferroviaria introduced its first tilting trains during the 1970s. They were first operated on the Italian railways in 1976.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Fiat Ferroviaria supplied much of the content of the Class 390, including the unit's bodyshell and the bogies, while final assembly was carried out at Washwood Heath. The tilting technology was developed by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft|SIG]] Switzerland (later Fiat-SIG, today Alstom). Each car uses a pair of [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] [[actuator]]s to achieve the desired tilting angle. The train can tilt to a maximum of eight degrees, at which point one side of the train is {{cvt|380|mm}} higher above the track than the other. In contrast to other Fiat Ferroviaria tilting trains which use [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] tilting actuators, the electromechanical system offers lower maintenance cost and higher efficiency.<ref name=\"samath\">{{cite web |url= http://www.samathieson.com/bigtrain.htm |publisher= Mathieson, SA |date= March 2002 |title= Full tilt: Virgin's 140mph Pendolino trains |access-date=13 May 2011 |archive-date=27 September 2013  |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124004/http://www.samathieson.com/bigtrain.htm  }}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Pendolino at Beck Foot - geograph.org.uk - 358839.jpg|thumb|right|An unidentified [[Virgin Trains]] Pendolino tilting into one of the many curves on the northern part of the WCML.]]\n\nThe Pendolino is a high-speed [[electric multiple unit]] train, which incorporates [[Fiat Ferroviaria]]'s [[tilting train]] [[Pendolino]] technology. According to Ian Scoley of the design firm Priestman Goode, the design of the Pendolino is \"more reminiscent of an aircraft than a train\".<ref name = \"samath\"/> It has a maximum design speed of {{cvt|140|mph|0}}, which requires compatible infrastructure to do so. A nine-carriage Pendolino reportedly weighs around 471 tonnes, which is equivalent to a dozen fully laden lorries.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The structure of the Pendolino is largely composed of extruded aluminium panels; allegedly, this material is responsible for the train's exterior surface being considerably smoother than its steel counterparts.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The cross-section of the bodyshell is deliberately [[tapering (mathematics)|tapered]]; this shaping is a necessary requirement imposed by the train's ability to tilt around corners. To avoid the risk of striking passing trains or static structures whilst a carriage is being tilted, it necessitates that the body be narrower towards the top than it is at wheel height.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe nose of the Pendolino is manufactured out of composite materials and [[Molding (process)|mould]]ed in a similar fashion as has been used to produce the shells of [[racing car]]s.<ref name = \"samath\"/> This construction methodology has been claimed to have been readily compatible with the aerodynamic contouring techniques practised while also retaining considerable structural strength. Allegedly, at one stage of development, the nose was intended to [[tapering (mathematics)|taper]] as far forwards as {{cvt|7|m|ft}}, similar to the noses of [[Japan]]ese [[Shinkansen|bullet trains]].<ref name = \"samath\"/> However, as the design was refined, this was reduced to a tapering length of just {{cvt|3.5|m|ftin}} due to design constraints, while a roof fairing extends the curvature rearwards by a further {{cvt|3|m|ftin}}, located directly above and behind the driver's windscreen. To validate its performance, the forward section of the trains was subject to considerable aerodynamic testing to prove its suitability for high-speed operations.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Tilting===\nThe Pendolino features an actively actuated tilt system.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Each of the carriages can [[wikt:tilt|tilt]] up to eight degrees from the horizontal; this is done for the purpose of better managing the forces imposed between high speed trains and the track while traversing corners. On top of this, the lines of the Network Rail network are often [[Cant (road/rail)|cant]]ed up to six degrees, akin to a shallow-banked [[cyclodrome]]; when combined with the Pendolino's tilt system, the train can reportedly comfortably take curves at a 20 per cent greater speed than it otherwise would be able to do so.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n \nThe active tilting mechanism is achieved using electrically operated tilt activators, which are situated under each carriage.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Unlike some alternative systems, which are pre-programmed to tilt at sections of a pre-determined route, the Pendolino's tilt system actively detects the upcoming corners using sensors and tilts appropriately to correspond. As tilting may not be appropriate or possible at some locations along the route, such as when travelling close to bridges and tunnels, the tilt mechanism can be disabled by an onboard system, called the ''Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision'' (TASS). This system relies upon trackside [[beacon]]s, which are typically spaced around five miles from one another, to transmit data to the train; this information, as well as temporarily locking-out the tilting mechanism from being used on relevant stretches of track, also relays the maximum permissible speeds for the adjacent corners.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Safety===\nThe Pendolino incorporates several different onboard safety systems, including the [[Automatic Warning System]] (AWS) and the [[Train Protection Warning System]] (TPWS); it was also planned to install compatible equipment for the [[European Train Control System]] (ETCS).<ref name = \"samath\"/> These systems automatically deliver situational warnings regarding the relevant signals and speed limits to the driver and, if not reacted to appropriately, are able to bring the train to a complete halt. Unlike most trains, it also features a ''Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision'' (TASS) system, which is used to control the onboard tilting mechanism.<ref name = \"samath\"/> In the event of an accident, each Pendolino also incorporates a [[train event recorder|black box data recorder]]; another structural measure, designed to help dissipate the forces involved in an incident involving a severe collision, are the [[crumple zone|crush zone]]s, which can reportedly absorb three times the forces of existing [[InterCity 125|High Speed Trains]].<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe Pendolino features relatively shallow windows in comparison to trains such as the Voyager; visually, the windows are linked by a black livery line to form a continuous band running along the length of the train. A combination of structural constraints and internal configuration selections had determined the narrowness of the windows; the adoption of larger windows would have intrinsically weakened the bodyshell of each carriage. Reportedly, consideration was given to the adoption of asymmetric window layout during the design process, but this was ultimately discarded in favour of the arrangement used in service instead.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nDue to these design choices, the Pendolino has a very high level of structural integrity. In the [[Grayrigg derailment]] incident, where the unit involved was travelling at a speed of {{cvt|95|mph|-1}} and derailed at a set of points sending the carriages off the track and down a bank, only a single person died. Furthermore, the majority of passengers were not even seriously injured due to the carriages' structural properties.\n\n=== Traction systems ===\nThe Pendolino's propulsion system incorporates Alstom's Onix traction drive system, which controls 12 separate [[traction motor]]s, each capable of providing up to {{convert|570|hp}}.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Combined, they are capable of producing a rate of acceleration of up to 0.43 ms<sup>\u22122</sup>, which enables the train to accelerate from stationary to {{cvt|60|mph|-1}} within 60 seconds. Power for each ''Pendolino'' is supplied in the form of 25,000 [[volt]]s [[Alternating current|AC]], and is delivered via the [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] infrastructure installed across its route.<ref name = \"samath\"/> A particularly unusual measure, which was adopted to account for the train's tilting ability, is incorporated into the [[pantograph]], the roof-mounted mechanism which connects the train to the overhead wires; it also features an active tilting system, which moves the pantograph to a precise angle in opposition to the direction of the carriages' tilt, allowing contact with the overhead catenary to be smoothly maintained.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Passenger amenities===\nThe ''Pendolino'' features a number of amenities and innovations, such as a walk-in shop in place of the traditional buffet/restaurant car and the extensive presence of passenger visual information systems, which are installed on both the inside of the car ends and on the outside of the doors themselves.<ref name = \"samath\"/> In response to criticisms of the pressure-operated automatic gangway doors fitted to the [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] and [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark 4]] carriages (which could easily be held open by items of luggage resting on the floor sensor, allowing draughts into the passenger saloon), the gangway doors of the ''Pendolino'' have press buttons instead. To assist the boarding process, the doors incorporate automatically extending steps, which deploy when the doors open; this feature is claimed to have been first used on the [[APT-P]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOriginally, every seat had an integrated on-board entertainment system, which featured radio stations, including [[Virgin Radio]], several [[BBC Radio|BBC station]]s, and a number of pre-recorded music channels. Up-to-date information on the available channels was provided via listing booklets, which were available on board. [[Headphones]] were necessary to listen, which could be purchased at the shop.<ref name = \"samath\"/> During March 2010, this system was replaced by onboard [[WiFi]] provided by mobile operator [[T-Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/voucher/vt-headphones.pdf |title=Please note: Virgin Trains onboard entertainment system no longer functions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820205927/http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/voucher/vt-headphones.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |access-date=18 November 2010  |website=[[Virgin Trains]]}}</ref> First class passengers were provided with a 240 volt [[AC power plugs and sockets#British and compatible standards|mains power socket]] at each seat.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe ''Pendolino'' uses an electronic seat reservations system.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Each seat has a small [[dot-matrix]] [[LCD]] installed near the top. If the seat has been reserved, the display shows the station the seat is booked from until that station has been passed: after that point, it displays \"Available unless occupied\". The display can also show the name of the passenger if this has been entered at the time of booking. This information is provided by the onboard Train Management System (TMS), which downloads current data via mobile operator [[Vodafone]]\u2019s wireless network from the national Customer Reservation System shared by all train operators.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The TMS is also used to provide route information to the passenger visual information systems.

Four additional Savigliano-built 11-car units (nos. 390 154-157) were delivered at the same time, to support service enhancements.

Pendolinos started to operate services to {{Stnlnk|Glasgow Central}}, and by the end of summer, in theory, all services north of Preston were worked by Class 390 units. This allowed the final [[British Rail Class 90|Class 90]] locomotives to be withdrawn, and inroads were made into the main [[British Rail Class 87|Class 87]] fleet. It was expected that all locomotive-hauled trains would have been replaced by the end of 2004, but the Pendolinos suffered from several technical problems, which granted the Class 87s a temporary reprieve. By January 2005, only eight locomotives remained, for use on peak London Euston-|Birmingham New Street services.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAnother development during 2004 was the clearing of the units for the [[North Wales Coast Line]] from {{stnlnk|Crewe}} to {{stnlnk|Holyhead}}. This line is not electrified, so Virgin's [[British Rail Class 57|Class 57/3]] ''Thunderbird'' [[diesel locomotive]]s were used to haul the Pendolinos. After Virgin Trains lost the [[Virgin CrossCountry|CrossCountry franchise]], the company decided to allocate its remaining [[British Rail Class 221|Class 221]] ''Super Voyagers'' to the coastal line, ending the practice of hauling ''Pendolinos'' from Crewe and thus making several Class 57 locomotives redundant. These locomotives have special [[Dellner coupling]] adaptors and electrical systems to make them compatible with Pendolino trains, allowing failed units to be rescued quicker. The Class 57s are also used when engineering works force Pendolino services to run over non-electrified diversionary routes.\n\nThe entire ''Pendolino'' fleet is allocated to Alstom's [[Longsight Electric TMD|Manchester Traincare Centre]] at [[Longsight]], where heavy maintenance is carried out. Longsight has a hoist on which an entire Pendolino set can be lifted. Lighter maintenance, cleaning and overnight stabling are carried out at Alstom's other centres: Wembley (London), [[Oxley TRSMD|Oxley]] (Wolverhampton), [[Edge Hill, Liverpool|Edge Hill]] (Liverpool) and Polmadie (Glasgow).\n\nOn 5 April 2012, the first 11-car Pendolino entered service on the London-Birmingham-Wolverhampton and London-Manchester routes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Fleet liveries and names===\n\nAll sets were delivered in Virgin Trains livery of silver bodysides with black areas around the windows, red roofs and red cab-sides with the red areas on the cabs were separated from the silver with a curved white band. Doors were originally painted with grey and white stripes. These were re-vinyled in plain grey in 2015. All 53 of the original sets were given cast nameplates in a standard style bearing the word Pendolino on the top of each name although several sets were subsequently renamed with similar replacement cast nameplates being fitted. New cast names were applied to the additional four sets after they had initially entered service without names.\n\nFrom September 2017 onwards, the fleet was repainted by Alstom in [[Widnes]] into a new livery known as \"flowing silk\", featuring plain white bodysides, black roofs and a vinyl applied red swoosh around the driving cab intended to visually represent a moving piece of silk.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globalrailwayreview.com/news/62566/virgin-trains-pendolino-new-look/ |title=Virgin Trains\u2019 Pendolino has been given a new look |website=Global Railway Review |publisher=Russell Publishing |location=Brasted, Kent |date=18 September 2017 |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.virgintrains.co.uk/about/media-room#/pressreleases/new-lick-of-paint-for-virgin-trains-pendolino-2150541 |title=New lick of paint for Virgin Trains\u2019 Pendolino |publisher=[[Virgin Trains]] |date=16 September 2017 |access-date=5 May 2018 |archive-date=17 June 2018  |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131614354900/http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/about/media-room/#/pressreleases/new-lick-of-paint-for-virgin-trains-pendolino-2150541}}</ref> The livery was designed to use neutral colours at the behest of the [[Department for Transport]] to allow for an easier rebranding.<ref name=TRUK191>{{cite magazine |title=New livery for Virgin Pendolinos |magazine=[[Today's Railways UK]] |issue=191 |date=November 2017 |page=70 |publisher=Platform 5 Publishing |issn=14759713 |location=Sheffield|}}</ref> The first set to wear this livery was 390 010.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/virgin-trains-first-repainted-pendolino-back-in-traffic |title=Virgin Trains' first repainted Pendolino back in traffic |magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]] |publisher=[[Bauer Consumer Media]] |location=Peterborough|issn=09534563 |issue=836 |page=12 |date=18 September 2017 |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref> All of the nine-car sets were repainted with 390 050 being the last to be treated in August 2018, with repaints then commencing on the eleven-car sets.

The result has been severe overcrowding on some services, something that Virgin has somewhat mitigated through the increased frequency of service, and with the increase to 11-car formations.\n\nThe smaller size of the ''Pendolino'' windows has attracted comment and, in fact, the window size is unprecedented for British railway rolling stock. The wider window pillars mean that in some standard class carriages, 22.5% of the seats are parallel with either no window or only a limited portion of one, however the roll-over strength of the bodyshell was commented on regarding the crashworthiness performance of the train in the RAIB Accident Report into the derailment at Grayrigg.<ref>{{cite report |title=Derailment at Grayrigg 23 February 2007 |page=151 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Rail Accident Investigation Branch]] |url=https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports/derailment-at-grayrigg |date=14 July 2011 |access-date=13 November 2019  |via=[[gov.uk]]}}\n</ref>\n\n===Grayrigg derailment===\n{{Main|Grayrigg derailment}}\n[[File:VirginPendolinoDerailment.jpg|thumb|The scene at the Grayrigg derailment]]\nOn 23 February 2007, a faulty set of [[Railroad switch|points]] caused a Virgin Trains ''Pendolino'' to [[derailment|derail]] near [[Grayrigg]] in Cumbria.

Four new sets have been built with 11 cars, and 31 existing sets lengthened to 11 cars.<ref>The DfT accreditation process document specified 31 lengthened sets, with options for lengthening a further 21 sets and procuring a further 23 full sets.

Trains]].<ref name=AT1 /> They are [[electric multiple unit]]s using [[Fiat Ferroviaria]]'s [[tilting train]] [[Pendolino]] technology and built by [[Alstom]]. Fifty-three units were originally built between 2001 and 2004 for operation on the [[West Coast Main Line]] (WCML). The 8-car units were all later lengthened to 9 cars, then an additional four trains and also a further 62 cars were built between 2009 and 2012. The trains of the original batch were the last to be assembled at Alstom's [[Washwood Heath]] plant, before its closure in 2005. The remaining trains in the fleet were built in Italy.\n\nThe Class 390 ''Pendolino'' is one of the fastest domestic electric multiple units operating in Britain, with a design speed of {{cvt|140|mph|0}}; however, limitations to track signalling systems restrict the trains to a maximum speed of {{cvt|125|mph|-1}} in service. In September 2006, the Pendolino set a new speed record, completing the {{cvt|401|mi|adj=on}} length of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Glasgow Central to London Euston in 3&nbsp;hours, 55&nbsp;minutes, beating the 4-hour-14-minute record for the southbound run previously set in 1981 by its ancestor, [[British Rail]]'s [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT). The APT retains the ultimate speed record for this route, having completed the northbound journey between London Euston and Glasgow Central in 3&nbsp;hours 52&nbsp;minutes in 1984, which included a five-minute delay due to a signal fault.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5369808.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title= Virgin train breaks speed record |date=22 September 2006 |access-date=2 December 2015  |quote=Virgin Trains made the 401 mile journey in three hours and 55 minutes - knocking 19 minutes off the record set 25 years ago}}</ref> The fleet is maintained at [[Longsight Electric TMD|Longsight TMD]] near {{Stnlnk|Manchester Piccadilly}} station.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:390001 First Class Internal.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of First Class]]\n\nDuring 1997, private operator [[Virgin Rail Group]] started operating the [[InterCity West Coast]] franchise, taking over from state-owned operator [[British Rail]]. Virgin had been awarded the franchise having made a commitment to replace the locomotives and rolling stock in use on the route, namely the [[British Rail Class 86]], [[British Rail Class 87|87]] and [[British Rail Class 90|90]] [[electric locomotive]]s and [[British Rail Mark 2|Mark 2]] and [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaching stock, with brand new [[tilting train]]s. Following negotiations with several manufacturers, Virgin placed an order with [[Alstom]]/[[Fiat Ferroviaria]] to produce the envisioned tilting train, which was known by the name ''Pendolino'' and was later designated under [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification#1973 numbering and classification - TOPS|TOPS]] as the ''Class 390''.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe purpose of tilt on the Pendolino was to maintain passenger comfort levels when traversing curves at high speed by reducing the sideways forces on the train's occupants, minimising their tendency to slide across the carriage.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The train was designed to be visually impressive: the concept design for the Pendolino was originally produced by industrial design firm Priestman Goode in cooperation with JHL and Start Design and many aspects of the finished product, such as the shaping of its aerodynamic nose and much of the train's interior areas, can be attributed to them.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe concept of deploying tilting trains on the [[West Coast Main Line]] was not an original one. During the 1980s and 1990s, British Rail had developed several plans to introduce new trains and pursued the development of the revolutionary, but ultimately unsuccessful, [[British Rail Class 370|Class 370]] [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT) for a protracted period.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Some years after the cancellation of the APT, British Rail had intended to replace the existing fleet of trains on the West Coast Main Line (in conjunction with a planned route modernisation) as part of the [[InterCity 250]] project, but this was cancelled by the government shortly before the [[Privatisation of British Rail]] during the late 1990s.\n\nThe original Pendolino order was for 54 nine-carriage sets, costing \u00a3500 million.<ref name = \"knig 2000\"/> As originally planned, a pre-series test train was scheduled to be completed and to be in active testing by July 2000, while the first Pendolino was to enter revenue service during March 2001. It was expected that the whole fleet would be delivered by May 2002.<ref name=\"knig 2000\">{{cite magazine |last=Knight |first=Stephen |url=https://railm.blob.core.windows.net/website/1/rail-archive/rail-345.pdf |title=Virgin's first West Coast tilt train 'on test by July 2000' |magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP Apex Publications]] |issn=09534563 |oclc=49953699 |date=2 December 1998 |issue=345 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520054904/https://railm.blob.core.windows.net/website/1/rail-archive/rail-345.pdf |archive-date=20 May 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Pendolinos were intended to run at service speeds of up to {{cvt|140|mph|0}}. Railtrack, therefore, embarked on a modernisation of the West Coast Main Line to allow for the faster line speeds.<ref name = \"knig 2000\"/> However, the programme ran into serious difficulties. By its end, it was almost four times over-budget, had been delayed by a number of years, and had not improved the infrastructure as much as had been planned. Consequently, and in a manner reminiscent of the introduction of the [[InterCity 225]], the lack of signalling upgrades resulted in the maximum line speed being set at {{cvt|125|mph|-1}}. Although the Pendolino's in-service top speed is well below British Rail's hopes for the APT, which was to reach up to {{cvt|155|mph|-1}}, it does match the maximum speed of {{cvt|125|mph|-1}} for the APT in passenger service.\n\nFiat Ferroviaria introduced its first tilting trains during the 1970s. They were first operated on the Italian railways in 1976.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Fiat Ferroviaria supplied much of the content of the Class 390, including the unit's bodyshell and the bogies, while final assembly was carried out at Washwood Heath. The tilting technology was developed by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft|SIG]] Switzerland (later Fiat-SIG, today Alstom). Each car uses a pair of [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] [[actuator]]s to achieve the desired tilting angle. The train can tilt to a maximum of eight degrees, at which point one side of the train is {{cvt|380|mm}} higher above the track than the other. In contrast to other Fiat Ferroviaria tilting trains which use [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] tilting actuators, the electromechanical system offers lower maintenance cost and higher efficiency.<ref name=\"samath\">{{cite web |url= http://www.samathieson.com/bigtrain.htm |publisher= Mathieson, SA |date= March 2002 |title= Full tilt: Virgin's 140mph Pendolino trains |access-date=13 May 2011 |archive-date=27 September 2013  |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124004/http://www.samathieson.com/bigtrain.htm  }}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Pendolino at Beck Foot - geograph.org.uk - 358839.jpg|thumb|right|An unidentified [[Virgin Trains]] Pendolino tilting into one of the many curves on the northern part of the WCML.]]\n\nThe Pendolino is a high-speed [[electric multiple unit]] train, which incorporates [[Fiat Ferroviaria]]'s [[tilting train]] [[Pendolino]] technology. According to Ian Scoley of the design firm Priestman Goode, the design of the Pendolino is \"more reminiscent of an aircraft than a train\".<ref name = \"samath\"/> It has a maximum design speed of {{cvt|140|mph|0}}, which requires compatible infrastructure to do so. A nine-carriage Pendolino reportedly weighs around 471 tonnes, which is equivalent to a dozen fully laden lorries.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The structure of the Pendolino is largely composed of extruded aluminium panels; allegedly, this material is responsible for the train's exterior surface being considerably smoother than its steel counterparts.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The cross-section of the bodyshell is deliberately [[tapering (mathematics)|tapered]]; this shaping is a necessary requirement imposed by the train's ability to tilt around corners. To avoid the risk of striking passing trains or static structures whilst a carriage is being tilted, it necessitates that the body be narrower towards the top than it is at wheel height.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe nose of the Pendolino is manufactured out of composite materials and [[mould]]ed in a similar fashion as has been used to produce the shells of [[racing car]]s.<ref name = \"samath\"/> This construction methodology has been claimed to have been readily compatible with the aerodynamic contouring techniques practised while also retaining considerable structural strength. Allegedly, at one stage of development, the nose was intended to [[tapering (mathematics)|taper]] as far forwards as {{cvt|7|m|ft}}, similar to the noses of [[Japan]]ese [[Shinkansen|bullet trains]].<ref name = \"samath\"/> However, as the design was refined, this was reduced to a tapering length of just {{cvt|3.5|m|ftin}} due to design constraints, while a roof fairing extends the curvature rearwards by a further {{cvt|3|m|ftin}}, located directly above and behind the driver's windscreen. To validate its performance, the forward section of the trains was subject to considerable aerodynamic testing to prove its suitability for high-speed operations.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Tilting===\nThe Pendolino features an actively actuated tilt system.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Each of the carriages can [[wikt:tilt|tilt]] up to eight degrees from the horizontal; this is done for the purpose of better managing the forces imposed between high speed trains and the track while traversing corners. On top of this, the lines of the Network Rail network are often [[Cant (road/rail)|cant]]ed up to six degrees, akin to a shallow-banked [[cyclodrome]]; when combined with the Pendolino's tilt system, the train can reportedly comfortably take curves at a 20 per cent greater speed than it otherwise would be able to do so.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n \nThe active tilting mechanism is achieved using electrically operated tilt activators, which are situated under each carriage.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Unlike some alternative systems, which are pre-programmed to tilt at sections of a pre-determined route, the Pendolino's tilt system actively detects the upcoming corners using sensors and tilts appropriately to correspond. As tilting may not be appropriate or possible at some locations along the route, such as when travelling close to bridges and tunnels, the tilt mechanism can be disabled by an onboard system, called the ''Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision'' (TASS). This system relies upon trackside [[beacon]]s, which are typically spaced around five miles from one another, to transmit data to the train; this information, as well as temporarily locking-out the tilting mechanism from being used on relevant stretches of track, also relays the maximum permissible speeds for the adjacent corners.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Safety===\nThe Pendolino incorporates several different onboard safety systems, including the [[Automatic Warning System]] (AWS) and the [[Train Protection Warning System]] (TPWS); it was also planned to install compatible equipment for the [[European Train Control System]] (ETCS).<ref name = \"samath\"/> These systems automatically deliver situational warnings regarding the relevant signals and speed limits to the driver and, if not reacted to appropriately, are able to bring the train to a complete halt. Unlike most trains, it also features a ''Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision'' (TASS) system, which is used to control the onboard tilting mechanism.<ref name = \"samath\"/> In the event of an accident, each Pendolino also incorporates a [[train event recorder|black box data recorder]]; another structural measure, designed to help dissipate the forces involved in an incident involving a severe collision, are the [[crumple zone|crush zone]]s, which can reportedly absorb three times the forces of existing [[InterCity 125|High Speed Trains]].<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe Pendolino features relatively shallow windows in comparison to trains such as the Voyager; visually, the windows are linked by a black livery line to form a continuous band running along the length of the train. A combination of structural constraints and internal configuration selections had determined the narrowness of the windows; the adoption of larger windows would have intrinsically weakened the bodyshell of each carriage. Reportedly, consideration was given to the adoption of asymmetric window layout during the design process, but this was ultimately discarded in favour of the arrangement used in service instead.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nDue to these design choices, the Pendolino has a very high level of structural integrity. In the [[Grayrigg derailment]] incident, where the unit involved was travelling at a speed of {{cvt|95|mph|-1}} and derailed at a set of points sending the carriages off the track and down a bank, only a single person died. Furthermore, the majority of passengers were not even seriously injured due to the carriages' structural properties.\n\n=== Traction systems ===\nThe Pendolino's propulsion system incorporates Alstom's Onix traction drive system, which controls 12 separate [[traction motor]]s, each capable of providing up to {{convert|570|hp}}.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Combined, they are capable of producing a rate of acceleration of up to 0.43 ms<sup>\u22122</sup>, which enables the train to accelerate from stationary to {{cvt|60|mph|-1}} within 60 seconds. Power for each ''Pendolino'' is supplied in the form of 25,000 [[volt]]s [[Alternating current|AC]], and is delivered via the [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] infrastructure installed across its route.<ref name = \"samath\"/> A particularly unusual measure, which was adopted to account for the train's tilting ability, is incorporated into the [[pantograph]], the roof-mounted mechanism which connects the train to the overhead wires; it also features an active tilting system, which moves the pantograph to a precise angle in opposition to the direction of the carriages' tilt, allowing contact with the overhead catenary to be smoothly maintained.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Passenger amenities===\nThe ''Pendolino'' features a number of amenities and innovations, such as a walk-in shop in place of the traditional buffet/restaurant car and the extensive presence of passenger visual information systems, which are installed on both the inside of the car ends and on the outside of the doors themselves.<ref name = \"samath\"/> In response to criticisms of the pressure-operated automatic gangway doors fitted to the [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] and [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark 4]] carriages (which could easily be held open by items of luggage resting on the floor sensor, allowing draughts into the passenger saloon), the gangway doors of the ''Pendolino'' have press buttons instead. To assist the boarding process, the doors incorporate automatically extending steps, which deploy when the doors open; this feature is claimed to have been first used on the [[APT-P]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOriginally, every seat had an integrated on-board entertainment system, which featured radio stations, including [[Virgin Radio]], several [[BBC Radio|BBC station]]s, and a number of pre-recorded music channels. Up-to-date information on the available channels was provided via listing booklets, which were available on board. [[Headphones]] were necessary to listen, which could be purchased at the shop.<ref name = \"samath\"/> During March 2010, this system was replaced by onboard [[WiFi]] provided by mobile operator [[T-Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/voucher/vt-headphones.pdf |title=Please note: Virgin Trains onboard entertainment system no longer functions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820205927/http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/voucher/vt-headphones.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |access-date=18 November 2010  |website=[[Virgin Trains]]}}</ref> First class passengers were provided with a 240 volt [[AC power plugs and sockets#British and compatible standards|mains power socket]] at each seat.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\nThe ''Pendolino'' uses an electronic seat reservations system.<ref name = \"samath\"/> Each seat has a small [[dot-matrix]] [[LCD]] installed near the top. If the seat has been reserved, the display shows the station the seat is booked from until that station has been passed: after that point, it displays \"Available unless occupied\". The display can also show the name of the passenger if this has been entered at the time of booking. This information is provided by the onboard Train Management System (TMS), which downloads current data via mobile operator [[Vodafone]]\u2019s wireless network from the national Customer Reservation System shared by all train operators.<ref name = \"samath\"/> The TMS is also used to provide route information to the passenger visual information systems. If a train is rescheduled, the system can rapidly be updated and the displayed information changed to reflect the new schedule.<ref name = \"samath\"/>\n\n===Consist===\nThe original 53-set Pendolino fleet was delivered in nine-car formation, with vehicles built at the former [[Metro-Cammell]] [[Washwood Heath]] plant (by then owned by [[Alstom]]), in Birmingham. 31 sets were later extended to 11-car formation, with the addition of two new carriages (the 653xx Trailer Standards and the 689xx Motor Standards), built by Alstom at [[Savigliano]], in [[Italy]]. Four additional Savigliano-built 11-car units (nos. 390 154-157) were delivered at the same time, to support service enhancements. The unit formation, as of January 2015 (and still at the conclusion of the Virgin Trains franchise, in December 2019), is described in the table below, with vehicles listed in the order they are formed in the unit:<ref>{{cite web|title=Seating Plan |url=http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/global/seating-plan.pdf |website=[[Virgin Trains]] |access-date=24 January 2015 |archive-date=31 March 2010  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331143850/http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/assets/pdf/global/seating-plan.pdf }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2|Vehicle numbers\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Type\n!rowspan=2 align=left|Description\n!colspan=4|Seating\n|-\n!Letter\n!1ST\n!STD\n!Toilets\n|-\n|align=center|69101-69157\n|DMRF\n|Driving motor: first class open with kitchen\n|align=center|K\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|-\n|align=center|-\n|-\n|align=center|69401-69457\n|MF\n|Intermediate motor: first class open (with disabled seating)\n|align=center|J\n|align=center|37\n|align=center|-\n|align=center|1(D)\n|-\n|align=center|69501-69557\n|PTF\n|Intermediate trailer with pantograph: first class open\n|align=center|H\n|align=center|44\n|align=center|-\n|align=center|1\n|-\n|align=center|696xx\n|MF\n|Intermediate motor: first class open<br>''11 car sets only.

Pendolinos started to operate services to {{Stnlnk|Glasgow Central}}, and by the end of summer, in theory, all services north of Preston were worked by Class 390 units. This allowed the final [[British Rail Class 90|Class 90]] locomotives to be withdrawn, and inroads were made into the main [[British Rail Class 87|Class 87]] fleet. It was expected that all locomotive-hauled trains would have been replaced by the end of 2004, but the Pendolinos suffered from several technical problems, which granted the Class 87s a temporary reprieve. By January 2005, only eight locomotives remained, for use on peak London Euston-|Birmingham New Street services.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAnother development during 2004 was the clearing of the units for the [[North Wales Coast Line]] from {{stnlnk|Crewe}} to {{stnlnk|Holyhead}}. This line is not electrified, so Virgin's [[British Rail Class 57|Class 57/3]] ''Thunderbird'' [[diesel locomotive]]s were used to haul the Pendolinos. After Virgin Trains lost the [[Virgin CrossCountry|CrossCountry franchise]], the company decided to allocate its remaining [[British Rail Class 221|Class 221]] ''Super Voyagers'' to the coastal line, ending the practice of hauling ''Pendolinos'' from Crewe and thus making several Class 57 locomotives redundant. These locomotives have special [[Dellner coupling]] adaptors and electrical systems to make them compatible with Pendolino trains, allowing failed units to be rescued quicker. The Class 57s are also used when engineering works force Pendolino services to run over non-electrified diversionary routes.\n\nThe entire ''Pendolino'' fleet is allocated to Alstom's [[Longsight Electric TMD|Manchester Traincare Centre]] at [[Longsight]], where heavy maintenance is carried out. Longsight has a hoist on which an entire Pendolino set can be lifted. Lighter maintenance, cleaning and overnight stabling are carried out at Alstom's other centres: Wembley (London), [[Oxley TRSMD|Oxley]] (Wolverhampton), [[Edge Hill, Liverpool|Edge Hill]] (Liverpool) and Polmadie (Glasgow).\n\nOn 5 April 2012, the first 11-car Pendolino entered service on the London-Birmingham-Wolverhampton and London-Manchester routes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Fleet liveries and names===\n\nAll sets were delivered in Virgin Trains livery of silver bodysides with black areas around the windows, red roofs and red cab-sides with the red areas on the cabs were separated from the silver with a curved white band. Doors were originally painted with grey and white stripes. These were re-vinyled in plain grey in 2015. All 53 of the original sets were given cast nameplates in a standard style bearing the word Pendolino on the top of each name although several sets were subsequently renamed with similar replacement cast nameplates being fitted. New cast names were applied to the additional four sets after they had initially entered service without names.\n\nFrom September 2017 onwards, the fleet was repainted by Alstom in [[Widnes]] into a new livery known as \"flowing silk\", featuring plain white bodysides, black roofs and a vinyl applied red swoosh around the driving cab intended to visually represent a moving piece of silk.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globalrailwayreview.com/news/62566/virgin-trains-pendolino-new-look/ |title=Virgin Trains\u2019 Pendolino has been given a new look |website=Global Railway Review |publisher=Russell Publishing |location=Brasted, Kent |date=18 September 2017 |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.virgintrains.co.uk/about/media-room#/pressreleases/new-lick-of-paint-for-virgin-trains-pendolino-2150541 |title=New lick of paint for Virgin Trains\u2019 Pendolino |publisher=[[Virgin Trains]] |date=16 September 2017 |access-date=5 May 2018 |archive-date=17 June 2018  |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131614354900/http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/about/media-room/#/pressreleases/new-lick-of-paint-for-virgin-trains-pendolino-2150541}}</ref> The livery was designed to use neutral colours at the behest of the [[Department for Transport]] to allow for an easier rebranding.<ref name=TRUK191>{{cite magazine |title=New livery for Virgin Pendolinos |magazine=[[Today's Railways UK]] |issue=191 |date=November 2017 |page=70 |publisher=Platform 5 Publishing |issn=14759713 |location=Sheffield|}}</ref> The first set to wear this livery was 390 010.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/virgin-trains-first-repainted-pendolino-back-in-traffic |title=Virgin Trains' first repainted Pendolino back in traffic |magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]] |publisher=[[Bauer Consumer Media]] |location=Peterborough|issn=09534563 |issue=836 |page=12 |date=18 September 2017 |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref> All of the nine-car sets were repainted with 390 050 being the last to be treated in August 2018, with repaints then commencing on the eleven-car sets.

The result has been severe overcrowding on some services, something that Virgin has somewhat mitigated through the increased frequency of service, and with the increase to 11-car formations.\n\nThe smaller size of the ''Pendolino'' windows has attracted comment and, in fact, the window size is unprecedented for British railway rolling stock. The wider window pillars mean that in some standard class carriages, 22.5% of the seats are parallel with either no window or only a limited portion of one, however the roll-over strength of the bodyshell was commented on regarding the crashworthiness performance of the train in the RAIB Accident Report into the derailment at Grayrigg.<ref>{{cite report |title=Derailment at Grayrigg 23 February 2007 |page=151 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Rail Accident Investigation Branch]] |url=https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports/derailment-at-grayrigg |date=14 July 2011 |access-date=13 November 2019  |via=[[gov.uk]]}}\n</ref>\n\n===Grayrigg derailment===\n{{Main|Grayrigg derailment}}\n[[File:VirginPendolinoDerailment.jpg|thumb|The scene at the Grayrigg derailment]]\nOn 23 February 2007, a faulty set of [[Railroad switch|points]] caused a Virgin Trains ''Pendolino'' to [[derailment|derail]] near [[Grayrigg]] in Cumbria.

Aunt Em tells her to \"find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble\". This prompts her to walk off by herself, musing to Toto, \"Some place where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat, or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon, beyond the rain...\", at which point she begins singing.\n\n==Background==\nComposer Harold Arlen and lyricist Yip Harburg often worked in tandem, Harburg generally suggesting an idea or title for Arlen to set to music, before Harburg contributed the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Gary |title='Over the Rainbow': The Story Behind the Song of the Century |url=https://news.columbia.edu/news/over-rainbow-story-behind-song-century |website=Columbia News |accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref> For their work together on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', Harburg claimed his inspiration was \"a ballad for a little girl who... was in trouble and... wanted to get away from... Kansas. A dry, arid, colorless place. She had never seen anything colorful in her life except the rainbow\". Arlen decided the idea needed \"a melody with a long broad line\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisch |first1=Walter |title=Arlen and Harburg's Over the Rainbow |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=20}}</ref>\n\nBy the time all the other songs for the film had been written, however, Arlen was feeling the pressure of not having the required song for the Kansas scene. Arlen would often carry blank pieces of music manuscript in his pockets to jot down short melodic ideas. Arlen described how the inspiration for the melody to \"Over the Rainbow\" came to him suddenly while his wife Anya drove:\n\n\u201cI said to Mrs. Arlen... \u2018let\u2019s go to Grauman\u2019s Chinese ... You drive the car, I don\u2019t feel too well right now.\u2019 I wasn't thinking of work. I wasn't consciously thinking of work, I just wanted to relax. And as we drove by Schwab's Drug Store on Sunset I said, \u2018Pull over, please.\u2019 ... And we stopped and I really don't know why \u2014bless the muses\u2014 and I took out my little bit of manuscript and put down what you know now as \u2018Over the Rainbow.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alonso |first1=Harriet Hyman |title=Yip Harburg: Legendary Lyricist and Human Rights Activist |date=2012 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=106}}</ref>\n\nThe song was originally sung in [[A-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garland |first1=Judy |title=Over the Rainbow |url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0076720 |website=MusicNotes |accessdate=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Arlen later wrote the contrasting bridge section based on the idea of 'a child's piano exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisch |first1=Walter |title=Arlen and Harburg's Over the Rainbow |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=22}}</ref> The theme of Over the Rainbow has a very striking harmonic and melodic similarity with the theme of the interlude (known as Ratcliff's Dream) of the opera [[Guglielmo Ratcliff]] by [[Pietro Mascagni]], composed in 1895.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==''The Wizard of Oz''==\nThe \"Over the Rainbow\" and Kansas scenes were directed by the uncredited [[King Vidor]], because the film's main director, [[Victor Fleming]], was called in by [[David O. Selznick]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] to direct ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Fleming would later return to oversee the editing and post-production on ''The Wizard of Oz''. The song was initially deleted from the film after a preview in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], because MGM chief executive [[Louis B. Mayer]] thought it \"slowed down the picture,\" was being far over the heads over its targeted children audience, and sounded \"like something for [[Jeanette MacDonald]], not for a little girl singing in a barnyard\". Fleming, producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], associate producer [[Arthur Freed]], and [[Roger Edens]], who was [[Judy Garland]]'s vocal coach and mentor, fought together to have the song reinserted back into the film and they eventually won.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAt the start of the film, part of the song is played by the MGM orchestra over the opening credits. A reprise of the song was deleted after being filmed. The reprise was to be sung by Dorothy while she was locked in the Wicked Witch's castle, helplessly awaiting death as the hourglass is running out. Although the visual portion of that reprise is presumably lost, the soundtrack still exists and was included in the 2-CD Deluxe Edition of the film's soundtrack released by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 1995. In that intense rendition, Dorothy cries her way through it, unable to finish, concluding with, \"I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" This phrase was retained in the film and is followed immediately by Aunt Em's brief appearance in the crystal ball, where she is soon replaced by the visage of the Wicked Witch, ([[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]), mocking and taunting Dorothy before turning the camera toward her cackle. Another instrumental version is played in the underscore in the final scene and over the closing credits.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Recordings by Judy Garland==\n{{Listen |filename = Over The Rainbow.ogg |title = \"Over the Rainbow\" from ''The Wizard of Oz'' |description = A sample of the original version of \"Over the Rainbow\" from ''The Wizard of Oz'', sung by Judy Garland}}\n\nOn October 7, 1938, Judy Garland recorded the song on the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] soundstage with an arrangement by [[Murray Cutter]]. In September 1939, a [[studio recording]] of the song, not from the film soundtrack, was recorded and released as a single for [[Decca Records|Decca]]. In March 1940, that same recording was included on a Decca 78 four-record [[Studio recording|studio cast album]] entitled ''The Wizard of Oz''. Although this isn't the version that appeared in the film, Decca continued to release the \"cast album\" into the 1960s after it was reissued on disc, a 33{{fraction|1|3}}-rpm album.\n\nThe film version of \"Over the Rainbow\" was unavailable to the public until the soundtrack was released by MGM in 1956 to coincide with the television premiere of ''The Wizard of Oz''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejudyroom.com/discography/soundtracks/ozlp.html |title=''The Wizard of Oz'' Soundtracks (MGM label) |website=The Judy Room |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927025302/http://www.thejudyroom.com/discography/soundtracks/ozlp.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011}}</ref> The soundtrack version has been re-released several times over the years, including a deluxe edition by [[Rhino Records|Rhino]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thejudyroom.com/discography/soundtracks/ozcddeluxe.html|title=''The Wizard of Oz'' (Rhino Movie Music label) |website=The Judy Room|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126183613/http://thejudyroom.com/discography/soundtracks/ozcddeluxe.html |archivedate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Wizard of Oz'' appeared in 1939, \"Over the Rainbow\" became Garland's [[signature song]].

Aunt Em tells her to \"find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble\". This prompts her to walk off by herself, musing to Toto, \"Some place where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat, or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon, beyond the rain...\", at which point she begins singing.\n\n==Background==\nComposer Harold Arlen and lyricist Yip Harburg often worked in tandem, Harburg generally suggesting an idea or title for Arlen to set to music, before Harburg contributed the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Gary |title='Over the Rainbow': The Story Behind the Song of the Century |url=https://news.columbia.edu/news/over-rainbow-story-behind-song-century |website=Columbia News |accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref> For their work together on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', Harburg claimed his inspiration was \"a ballad for a little girl who... was in trouble and... wanted to get away from... Kansas. A dry, arid, colorless place. She had never seen anything colorful in her life except the rainbow\". Arlen decided the idea needed \"a melody with a long broad line\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisch |first1=Walter |title=Arlen and Harburg's Over the Rainbow |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=20}}</ref>\n\nBy the time all the other songs for the film had been written, however, Arlen was feeling the pressure of not having the required song for the Kansas scene. Arlen would often carry blank pieces of music manuscript in his pockets to jot down short melodic ideas. Arlen described how the inspiration for the melody to \"Over the Rainbow\" came to him suddenly while his wife Anya drove:\n\n\u201cI said to Mrs. Arlen... \u2018let\u2019s go to Grauman\u2019s Chinese ... You drive the car, I don\u2019t feel too well right now.\u2019 I wasn't thinking of work. I wasn't consciously thinking of work, I just wanted to relax. And as we drove by Schwab's Drug Store on Sunset I said, \u2018Pull over, please.\u2019 ... And we stopped and I really don't know why \u2014bless the muses\u2014 and I took out my little bit of manuscript and put down what you know now as \u2018Over the Rainbow.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alonso |first1=Harriet Hyman |title=Yip Harburg: Legendary Lyricist and Human Rights Activist |date=2012 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=106}}</ref>\n\nThe song was originally sung in [[A-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garland |first1=Judy |title=Over the Rainbow |url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0076720 |website=MusicNotes |accessdate=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Arlen later wrote the contrasting bridge section based on the idea of 'a child's piano exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisch |first1=Walter |title=Arlen and Harburg's Over the Rainbow |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=22}}</ref> The theme of Over the Rainbow has a very striking harmonic and melodic similarity with the theme of the interlude (known as Ratcliff's Dream) of the opera [[Guglielmo Ratcliff]] by [[Pietro Mascagni]], composed in 1895.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==''The Wizard of Oz''==\nThe \"Over the Rainbow\" and Kansas scenes were directed by the uncredited [[King Vidor]], because the film's main director, [[Victor Fleming]], was called in by [[David O. Selznick]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] to direct ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Fleming would later return to oversee the editing and post-production on ''The Wizard of Oz''. The song was initially deleted from the film after a preview in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], because MGM chief executive [[Louis B. Mayer]] thought it \"slowed down the picture,\" was being far over the heads over its targeted children audience, and sounded \"like something for [[Jeanette MacDonald]], not for a little girl singing in a barnyard\". Fleming, producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], associate producer [[Arthur Freed]], and [[Roger Edens]], who was [[Judy Garland]]'s vocal coach and mentor, fought together to have the song reinserted back into the film and they eventually won.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAt the start of the film, part of the song is played by the MGM orchestra over the opening credits. A reprise of the song was deleted after being filmed. The reprise was to be sung by Dorothy while she was locked in the Wicked Witch's castle, helplessly awaiting death as the hourglass is running out. Although the visual portion of that reprise is presumably lost, the soundtrack still exists and was included in the 2-CD Deluxe Edition of the film's soundtrack released by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 1995. In that intense rendition, Dorothy cries her way through it, unable to finish, concluding with, \"I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" This phrase was retained in the film and is followed immediately by Aunt Em's brief appearance in the crystal ball, where she is soon replaced by the visage of the Wicked Witch, ([[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]), mocking and taunting Dorothy before turning the camera toward her cackle. Another instrumental version is played in the underscore in the final scene and over the closing credits.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Recordings by Judy Garland==\n{{Listen |filename = Over The Rainbow.ogg |title = \"Over the Rainbow\" from ''The Wizard of Oz'' |description = A sample of the original version of \"Over the Rainbow\" from ''The Wizard of Oz'', sung by Judy Garland}}\n\nOn October 7, 1938, Judy Garland recorded the song on the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] soundstage with an arrangement by [[Murray Cutter]]. In September 1939, a [[studio recording]] of the song, not from the film soundtrack, was recorded and released as a single for [[Decca Records|Decca]]. In March 1940, that same recording was included on a Decca 78 four-record [[Studio recording|studio cast album]] entitled ''The Wizard of Oz''.

Such rules include the way in which the participants should look and the way in which they approach, dance with and leave their partner. [[Etiquette]] can vary in its specification and stringency between different [[style of dance|styles of dance]].\n\nWhy is dance etiquette important? It makes the difference between having a happy or unhappy dancing experience. It helps you avoid offending or upsetting your partner and other dancers. It helps you build a good reputation for yourself as a dancer.\n\n== Asking For A Dance ==\nWhen asking for a dance, it is best to stay with traditional phrases:\n*\t``May I have this dance?''\n*\t``Would you like to dance?''\n*\t``Care to dance?''\n*\t``Shall we dance?''\nIn the past men typically have followed the tradition that a man asked a woman to dance. This practice has changed over the years and today woman should feel equally comfortable asking a partner for a dance, no matter the setting. \n\n== Cutting In ==\nCutting in is a process in dancing where a person interrupts two dance partners and claims the partner of one. \nIf a gentleman or woman would like to dance with a someone who is already dancing with another person, he/she may cut in by approaching the dancing couple, tapping the him/her on the shoulder, and asking, \u201cMay I cut in?\u201d \"May I finish this dance?\" etc.\nIt is inappropriate for either member of the dancing pair to refuse the request to cut in.\u00a0If the first gentlemen or woman would like to dance with the other individual again, he/she must wait until the next dance to ask him/her to cut in.\n\n== Declining A Dance/Being Declined ==\n\nBeing declined is always hard to experience for both individuals. Dance etiquette requires that one should avoid declining a dance under most circumstances. For example, there is no correct way of refusing an invitation on the basis of preferring to dance with someone else. According to tradition, the only graceful way of declining a dance is either voice\n* You do not know the dance, \n* You need to take a rest, or \n* You have promised the dance to someone else. \nDancers are encouraged to use discretion and restraint when exercising this option. In some situations, the simplest best way may be to say \u201cNo, Thank You.\u201d \nResponding to a \u201cNo, Thank You\u201d can be tough, but don\u2019t read into it too much. They were polite and honest and maybe just don\u2019t want to dance. Dealing with rejection can show your true colors as well so, move on and go ask someone else, while smiling. \n\n== Dance Hygiene ==\nDance involves an activity where people may be in close contact. Before dancing make sure to\n* Be sure to bathe, \n* Wear deodorant,\n* Keep in mind of your breath, you may need a mint. \nThese are all things everyone should do daily but especially when dancing with a partner. \nMake sure to keep fingernails trimmed and/or out of harm\u2019s way. \n\n\n== Western social dance rules ==\n* The dancers move counter clockwise (from above) around the floor.\n* When things go wrong on the dance floor always apologize. Generally it does not matter who is at fault.\n* If you are moving more slowly than other dancers keep to the center of the floor.\n* If you are engaged in conversation move off the dance floor.\n* To cross the room either dance across the floor or walk around the perimeter.\n* Carry food and beverages around the perimeter. Wipe up your own spills.\n* While dancing, do not give dance tips unless asked. If asked, just give tips about what you were asked about. When engaged in giving a lengthy tip, or if you stop dancing to discuss it, move off the dance floor. And, above all, don't give that person tips again until they ask you again.\n* The traditional rule about declining dances was that you could politely turn down a request to dance only by saying something like \"No, thank you. I'm sitting this one out.\" or \"I'd be happy to dance with you later. I just need to rest now\", and that if you turn down a request to dance, to be polite, it was considered important that you not dance at all during the dance in question. Many dance groups today have abandoned this rule, and explicitly say that it's always ok to decline a dance with a simple \"no, thank you\", and no reason need be given.\n* Don't just dance with your favorite dancers. It's called \"social\" dancing for a reason.\n* It is always up to the [[Lead and follow|follow, not the lead]], to set the distance between the partners. However, if the lead feels like he is being held too closely for comfort or safety, they might say something like \"If you move away a little bit, I'll be able to lead you more safely.\" If either partner is not being allowed to set what they feel is a comfortable and safe distance, they should feel free to say that they need to sit down to rest, or something else equally polite.\n* Be aware of sight lines between ourselves, other dancers and the audience when onstage and offstage.\n\n{{Portal|Society}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Ballroom Etiquette ...
