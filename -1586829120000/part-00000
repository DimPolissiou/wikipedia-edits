The device features an [[Apple A4]] [[SoC]], a 9.7\" touchscreen display, and, on certain variants, the capability of accessing cellular networks. Using the [[iOS]] operating system, the iPad can [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions, which include the ability to play [[Video game|games]] and access [[reference work|references]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]] software and [[social network service]]s can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]].\n\nThe device was announced and unveiled on January 26, 2010 at a media conference. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the [[United States|USA]], followed by the release of the \"Wi-Fi + Cellular\" variant on April 30. On May 28, 2010, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nThe device received positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and [[netbook]]s. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, 3 million iPads were sold. By the launch of the [[iPad 2]], Apple sold more than 15 million iPads.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple announced the iPad 2 and reduced the price of the 1st-generation iPad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8357861/Apple-iPad-2-Steve-Jobs-makes-surprise-launch-appearance.html|title=Apple iPad 2: Steve Jobs makes surprise launch appearance|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/03/02/first-generation-ipad-prices-reduced-by-100/|title=First-Generation iPad Prices Reduced by $100|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech about the company:<ref name=\"panzarino20121002\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years/ | title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years | work=The Next Web | date=October 2, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Panzarino, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"[Our] strategy is really simple.

[[tablet computer]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] as the first in the [[iPad]] lineup. The device features an Apple A4 processor, a 9.7\" touchscreen display, and, on certain variants, the capability of accessing cellular networks. Using the [[iOS]] operating system, the iPad can [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions, which include the ability to play [[Video game|games]] and access [[reference work|references]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]] software and [[social network service]]s can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]].\n\nThe device was announced and unveiled on January 26, 2010 at a media conference. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the [[United States|USA]], followed by the release of the \"Wi-Fi + Cellular\" variant on April 30. On May 28, 2010, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nThe device received positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and [[netbook]]s. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, 3 million iPads were sold. By the launch of the [[iPad 2]], Apple sold more than 15 million iPads.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple announced the iPad 2 and reduced the price of the 1st-generation iPad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8357861/Apple-iPad-2-Steve-Jobs-makes-surprise-launch-appearance.html|title=Apple iPad 2: Steve Jobs makes surprise launch appearance|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/03/02/first-generation-ipad-prices-reduced-by-100/|title=First-Generation iPad Prices Reduced by $100|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech about the company:<ref name=\"panzarino20121002\">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years/ | title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years | work=The Next Web | date=October 2, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Panzarino, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"[Our] strategy is really simple.

It is the story of a 20-year-old orphan called Faltu (faltu in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] means worthless, junk) and his search for the man who has fathered him. This is also the account of a village and its people, woven around a narrative with myriad moments and a lot of dramatic events.\n\nRanirghat is a village made up of refugees from the then [[East Pakistan]]. (Its current population is 148.) The lives of the villagers take a new turn when a census official questions Faltu's parentage. While it is well known that Faltu is the son of Sureswari Dasi aka Suri Khepi (a mad woman on the street played [[Indrani Haldar]]), no one knows who his father is. Neither does Faltu nor he has even bothered with the question. He was happy with what he was doing &mdash; driving a bus and ferrying villagers.\n\nThe census official's question opens a [[Pandora's box]]. It turns out that many apparently upright men in the village &mdash; including Ismail ([[Biplab Chatterjee]]), who brought up Faltu and taught him driving &mdash; raped Suri Khepi, taking advantage of her mental condition. Everybody knows that Faltu's father is one of them, but nobody is sure of who that is. Faltu is not particularly concerned. He is more interested in earning his living, and pursuing his love interest &mdash; Tuktuki ([[Manjari Fadnis]]).\n\nA government order brings in bad news for the villagers of Ranirghat. As part of \"development\" plans, the government wants to construct a bridge from the village across the river and villagers have to vacate. They agree to do so but, before parting ways, they want Faltu and Tuktuki to marry to make up for what they had done to Suri Khepi. A guilty feeling haunts all the rapists.\n\nThe elders of the village call a meeting to organize the marriage. When they propose the marriage to Tuktuki's father, he flatly disagrees in a weird manner. He goes to Faltu and discloses that he also had raped Suri Khepi: The marriage should not occur as Faltu and Tuktuki are stepbrother and sister. Tuktuki overheard this. She commits suicide, and the next morning she is found hanging from a tree. The villagers of Ranirghat left with pain-stricken hearts, while the background narrator declares that \"with a proud and wounded heart, and several questions in mind, the undefeated Faltu drives on.\"\n\nAs the construction work of the bridge goes on, the last bit of film captures a night sequence at the construction site: an engineer, sensing the presence of any unknown one, turns on his torch on the person. The last scene freezes there, showing another mad woman trying to drink water from the streamlets pouring down from the upper iron structure. Like the case of Suri Khepi, perhaps this was the beginning of another story of committing sins.\n\nThe entire story deals with human relations and how the guilt of having done something wrong haunts everyone in the village. They want to make up for their sins, but end up opening a new can of worms and spoiling a marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Yash Pandit]] as Faltu\n*[[Manjari Fadnis]] as Tuktuki\n*[[Soumitra Chatterjee]] as Potter\n*[[Indrani Haldar]] as Suri Khepi \n*[[Nirmal Kumar]] as Priest\n*[[Sumanta Mukherjee]]\n*[[Debesh Roy Chowdhury]]\n*Masood Akhtar\n*[[Pradip Mukherjee]]\n\n==Crew==\n* '''Producer(s)''': [[Arindam Chaudhuri]] Planman Motion Pictures\n* '''Director''': [[Anjan Das]]\n*'''Story''':[[Syed Mustafa Siraj]]\n*'''Production Design''':\n*'''Dialogue''':\n*'''Lyrics''':\n*'''Editing''': Sanjeeb Dutta\n*'''Cinematography''': Shirsha Roy\n*'''Art:''' [[Samir Chanda]]\n*'''Sound:''' Anup Mukherjee\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n* A rich audio-visual experience &mdash; ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'' of Kolkata (8 stars out of 10)<ref>{{cite news |first=Mandira  |last=Mitra |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=  Hitting hard, lyrically|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060224/asp/etc/story_5890818.asp |work= |publisher=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]] |date=24 February 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref>\n* Anjan Das has meticulously crafted each scene in the film...

Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty. This forces Russ to turn informant against Ruth, who Roy intends to turn informant on Marty. Instead, Russ and his brother Boyd plan to rob and kill Marty to finance a life on the run.

Marty and Wendy learn this is the home of businessman and political donor Charles Wilkes and meet him to persuade him to back the legislation. Helen shows the Byrdes video of Ash using Del's credit card in Chicago. She will overlook Del's death (and Garcia's) in exchange for \"reparations\" from the Snells but does not tell Marty what will be satisfactory. At Darlene's insistence, the Snells refuse to offer money, but Jacob understands a life must be paid, so he kills Ash to save Darlene.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made.

It was based in [[Central Java]], and later in [[East Java]]. Established by King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the kingdom was ruled by the [[Sailendra]] dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive [[rice farming]], and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society,<ref name=\"Peradaban35\">{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=35 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref> had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of [[Candi of Indonesia|temple construction]].  Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in [[Yogyakarta|Mataram]] ([[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], all quite close to present-day city of [[Yogyakarta]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2012/02/18/04155621/Kisah.Mataram.di.Poros.Kedu-Prambanan|title=Kisah Mataram di Poros Kedu-Prambanan - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2012-02-18|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-09-08|language=id}}</ref> At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire\u2014not only in Java, but also in [[Srivijaya|Sumatra]], [[Bali]], [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], Indianized kingdoms of the [[Philippines]], and the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"Laguna Copperplate Inscription\">[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Ligor inscription\">[[Ligor inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Coed\u00e8s, George 1968\">Coed\u00e8s, George (1968).

Civil war followed.  The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the [[Sanjaya dynasty|Shivaist dynasty]] of Medang kingdom in [[Java]] led by [[Rakai Pikatan]] and the [[Shailendra dynasty|Buddhist dynasty]] of [[Srivijaya]] kingdom in [[Sumatra]] led by [[Balaputradewa]]. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the [[Kahuripan|Kahuripan kingdom]] led by [[Airlangga]], son of [[Udayana Warmadewa|Udayana]] of Bali.<ref>{{harvp|Brown|2003|p=23}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:BUDDINGH(1) p281 - RUINEN VAN PRAMBANAN, TJANDI SEWOE.jpg|thumb|right|A lithograph of ''[[Sewu|Tjandi Sewoe]]'' ruins near Prambanan, circa 1859|alt=|220x220px]]\nIn the early 19th century, the discovery of numerous ruins of [[Candi of Indonesia|great monuments]]\u2014such as [[Borobudur]], [[Sewu]] and [[Prambanan]]\u2014 which dominated the landscape of the [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain|Kewu]] plains in [[Yogyakarta Special Region|Yogyakarta]] and [[Central Java]], caught the attention of some historians and scholars in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Raffles1814\">{{cite book|title=The History of Java|author=Thomas Stamford Raffles|authorlink=Sir Thomas Raffles|year=1817|edition=1978|isbn=0-19-580347-7|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> This spurred [[archaeology|archaeological]] studies to uncover the history of this ancient civilisation.\n\nThe history of the Mataram area as the capital of the Central Javanese Medang kingdom is also part of the historical ''Yawadvipa'' or ''Bhumijava'' (the land of [[Java]]), and the classical Javanese civilisation. The [[India]]ns collectively called them as ''Yawadvipa'', the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] refer to them as ''Chvea'', the [[China|Chinese]] called them as ''Shepo'', ''Chopo'' or ''Chao-wa'', the Arabs called them as ''Jawi'' or ''Jawah'', and Srivijayan refer to them as ''Bhumijava''. The native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] most often refer to their lands and country simply as ''Jawi'' (Java), while the name of their ''nagara'' (country) is often based on their capital. The only foreign source mentioning ''Mda\u03b7'' was found from the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Philippines inscription]], dated 822 saka (900).<ref>{{cite web | title=The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary | first=Postma | last=Antoon | url=http://ojs.philippinestudies.net/index.php/ps/article/download/1033/1018 | publisher=Philippine Studies, Ateneo de Manila University | location=Loyola Heights, Quezon City, the Philippines | page=186 | accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borobudur]], the largest single Buddhist structure in the world, one of the monuments constructed by the [[Shailendra dynasty|Sailendran]] of the Medang Kingdom.|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nThere are no comprehensive written records that have survived in Java except numbers of ''prasasti'' (inscriptions) written on stones or copper plates. These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of [[Sannaha]] (Sanna's sister) ascended to the throne. He conquered the areas around his kingdom, and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all of his subjects.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Drs. R.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]. Most notable of these temples are [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temple. The [[Sailendra]]s are known as the ardent temple builder.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89}} This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty\u2014the [[Sailendra]]s\u2014and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\n====The great builder====\n[[File:Kalasan Temple from the south-south-east, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Kalasan]] temple was mentioned in [[Kalasan inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]].]]\n\n[[Panangkaran]] (r. 760\u2014780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kala\u00e7a village to a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' (Buddhist monastic community).<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

This hilltop compound was actually not a religious structure; consist of series of gates, ramparts, fortified walls, dry moats, walled enclosure, terraces and building bases.

Initially probably it was intended as a secluded hilltop Buddhist monastery, as mentioned in the Abhayagiri Vihara inscription.

The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780.

He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person.

He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines.

He appointed the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N. J. Krom]], and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as [[Slamet Muljana]] equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\n====Expansion to Bali====\n[[File:Buddha Manjucri from Goa Raja cave Bali.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] from [[Goa Gajah]] cave, Bali, demonstrated the influence of Javanese Medang Mataram Sailendran art.]]\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} According to [[Gedangan inscription]] (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. She later succeeded by her son [[Makutawangsa Wardhana]] c. 985. According to [[Pucangan inscription]] (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named [[Mahendradatta]], Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son [[Dharmawangsa|Dharmawangsa Tguh]] c. 990s.\n\nA later king, [[Dharmawangsa]], moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern [[Madiun]]. Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power. Previously the [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu which refer to a Srivijayan attack.\n\n====War against Srivijaya====\n[[File:032 Avadana Level 1, Ship and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Borobudur ship|Javanese vessel]] depicted in Borobudur.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills.

Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.<ref name=\"Kulke\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\n====Mahapralaya====\n[[File:Java, predating Nganjuk style, 10th century - Bodhisattva Padmapani - 1967.149 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddhist bronze figure depicting Boddhisattva Padmapani, 10th-century dated from late period of Medang Kingdom.]]\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt.

With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n# The commoners that formed the majority of kingdom's population.\n# The king with his royal family, including those nobles, landlords and the member of elite ruling class that depends on the king's court and his dynasty. Can be commonly called \"the palace/court people\".\n# The religious figures and religious authorities. The priests class; brahmins and monks, includes the lower rank servants employed in temple compounds and monasteries.<ref>de Casparis, 1954: 56</ref>\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple \u2014 especially Borobudur reliefs \u2014 the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=55\u201356 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n# '''The nobles''', the king and the royal families, landlords, nobles and those that related to ruling elites. They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' ''sima'' land to fund the construction and maintenance of a ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] golden artefacts attest to the wealth, art, and culture as well as the aesthetic achievement of the Medang Kingdom. The artefacts show the intricate artwork and technical mastery of the ancient Javanese [[goldsmith]].

Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist [[Kalasan]] temple, linked to [[Kalasan inscription]] (778 CE) and King [[Panangkaran]]. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\nIt was also during this period that numbers of dharmic scriptures either Hindu or Buddhist, has made their way from [[India]] into [[Javanese culture]]. For example, the tales of Buddhist [[Jataka]]s and [[Lalitavistara]], also Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] were adopted into Javanese version.

The [[India]]ns collectively called them as ''Yawadvipa'', the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] refer to them as ''Chvea'', the [[China|Chinese]] called them as ''Shepo'', ''Chopo'' or ''Chao-wa'', the Arabs called them as ''Jawi'' or ''Jawah'', and Srivijayan refer to them as ''Bhumijava''. The native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] most often refer to their lands and country simply as ''Jawi'' (Java), while the name of their ''nagara'' (country) is often based on their capital.

These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]. Most notable of these temples are [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temple. The [[Sailendra]]s are known as the ardent temple builder.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89}} This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty\u2014the [[Sailendra]]s\u2014and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\n====The great builder====\n[[File:Kalasan Temple from the south-south-east, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Kalasan]] temple was mentioned in [[Kalasan inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]].]]\n\n[[Panangkaran]] (r. 760\u2014780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kala\u00e7a village to a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' (Buddhist monastic community).<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780. This massive temple complex with total of 249 structures was the grandest of its time, and probably served as the official state's temple that conducted important stately religious ceremonies.<ref>{{Citation|work=Harian Kompas via Youtube|title=Candi Sewu Mandala Suci Manjusrigrha|author1=Gunawan Kartapranata|author2=Septa Inigopatria|author3=Emille Junior|date=2015-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riCSpUwgoJQ|access-date=2018-09-08}}</ref>\n\n====The great conqueror====\n[[File:Candi Sewu viewed from the south, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|left|The construction of [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple was mentioned in [[Manjusrigrha inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]] and completed during [[Dharanindra]] reign.]]\nThere are some reports that naval Javanese raiders invaded [[T\u0129nh H\u1ea3i qu\u00e2n|Tran-nam]] in 767, [[Champa]] in 774, and Champa again in 787.<ref name=Maspero>{{cite book|author=Maspero, G.|year=2002|title=The Champa Kingdom|location=Bangkok| publisher=White Lotus Co., Ltd.|isbn=9747534991|page=48,166,50}}</ref> The successor of Panangkaran was [[Dharanindra]] (r. 780\u2014800) or commonly known as King Indra. He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person. Dharanindra seems to be a valiant and warlike character, as he embarked on military naval expedition overseas and has brought Sailendras' control on [[Ligor]] in Malay Peninsula.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nKing Indra seems to continue the builder tradition of his predecessor. He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines.

He appointed the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N. J. Krom]], and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as [[Slamet Muljana]] equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\n====Expansion to Bali====\n[[File:Buddha Manjucri from Goa Raja cave Bali.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] from [[Goa Gajah]] cave, Bali, demonstrated the influence of Javanese Medang Mataram Sailendran art.]]\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} According to [[Gedangan inscription]] (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. She later succeeded by her son [[Makutawangsa Wardhana]] c. 985. According to [[Pucangan inscription]] (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named [[Mahendradatta]], Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son [[Dharmawangsa|Dharmawangsa Tguh]] c. 990s.\n\nA later king, [[Dharmawangsa]], moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern [[Madiun]]. Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power. Previously the [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu which refer to a Srivijayan attack.\n\n====War against Srivijaya====\n[[File:032 Avadana Level 1, Ship and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Borobudur ship|Javanese vessel]] depicted in Borobudur.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of ''San-fo-qi'' dispatched by the king Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, informed that a Buddhist temple had been erected in their country to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.<ref name=\"Kulke\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\n====Mahapralaya====\n[[File:Java, predating Nganjuk style, 10th century - Bodhisattva Padmapani - 1967.149 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddhist bronze figure depicting Boddhisattva Padmapani, 10th-century dated from late period of Medang Kingdom.]]\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt.

This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked.\n\nThis calamity was recorded in Javanese account as the ''pralaya'' (the debacle) the death of the Mataram kingdom.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144}} With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the capital, under military pressure from Srivijaya, the kingdom finally collapsed and fell to chaos. With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n# The commoners that formed the majority of kingdom's population.\n# The king with his royal family, including those nobles, landlords and the member of elite ruling class that depends on the king's court and his dynasty. Can be commonly called \"the palace/court people\".\n# The religious figures and religious authorities. The priests class; brahmins and monks, includes the lower rank servants employed in temple compounds and monasteries.<ref>de Casparis, 1954: 56</ref>\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple \u2014 especially Borobudur reliefs \u2014 the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=55\u201356 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n# '''The nobles''', the king and the royal families, landlords, nobles and those that related to ruling elites. They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty.

The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics.

Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist [[Kalasan]] temple, linked to [[Kalasan inscription]] (778 CE) and King [[Panangkaran]]. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation.

Nontok misuses a divine weapon given to him by Shiva. The four-armed Mohini-Vishnu enchants Nontok and then attacks him. In his last moments, the demon accuses Vishnu of foul play saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then attacked him. Vishnu decrees that in his next birth, Nontok will be born as the ten-headed demon [[Ravana]] and Vishnu will be a mortal man called [[Rama]]. He will then fight him and defeat him.<ref name = \"P67\"/>\n\nIn a lesser-known tale in the ''[[Ganesha Purana]]'' (900\u20131400 CE) the wise asura king Virochana is rewarded a magical crown by the sun-god [[Surya]]. The crown shields him against all harm. Vishnu as Mohini then enchants Virochana and steals his crown. The demon, thus unprotected, is killed by Vishnu.<ref name=\"Pattanaik_70-1\">Pattanaik (2001), pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nAnother South Indian legend about the demon Araka associates Mohini with [[Krishna]] (an [[avatar]] of Vishnu) rather than the god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna takes the form of the beautiful Mohini and marries him.

Shiva is overcome by [[K\u0101ma]] (love and desire) in this version of mythology. Shiva's unfailing energy falls from his eye on the ground creating ores of silver and gold. Vishnu then states that emotions are difficult to overcome, and states that Maya will become a half of Shiva's Ardhanarisvara aspect. Shiva then extols Vishnu's power.<ref name=\"jarow\"/><ref name=\"Goudriaan pp. 42\u201343\"/>\n \nThe ''[[Tripura Rahasya|Tripurarahasya]]'', a south Indian [[Shakta]] text, retells the story, giving more importance to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears that he may be burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the supreme ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess [[Tripura Sundari|Tripura]], who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his energy spills from his eyes, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.<ref name = \"G43\">Goudriaan p. 43</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' when the wandering sage [[Narada]] tells Shiva about Vishnu's Mohini form that deluded the demons, Shiva dismisses him. Shiva and his wife Parvati go to Vishnu's home. Shiva asks him to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Vishnu smiles, again meditates on the Goddess of Shri Lalita Mahatripurasundari and transforms himself into Mohini. Overcome by desire, Shiva embraces Mohini to discharge his seed from his eyes which falls on the ground leading to the birth the god Maha-[[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] (\"The Great Teacher\"). Mohini disappears, while Shiva returns home with Parvati.<ref>Doniger (1999) pp. 263\u201365</ref><ref name=Vanita69>Vanita & Kidwai (2001), p. 69</ref> While the narrative of events vary widely, the events are generally interpreted as \"leela\" between the Gods leading to the creation of Shasta, who was to be born of Shiva and Vishnu to defeat the evil Mahishasuri.\n\nShasta is identified primarily with two regional deities: [[Ayyappan|Ayyappa]] from [[Kerala]] and the Tamil [[Aiyanar]]. He is also identified with the classical Hindu gods [[Murugan|Skanda]] and [[Hanuman]].<ref name = \"D64\">Doniger (1999) p. 264</ref> One of the variants of the story says that instead of a biological origin, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's energy, which is discharged upon embracing Mohini.<ref>Pattanaik (2001), p. 76</ref> Ayyappa is referred to as ''Hariharaputra'', \"the son of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara)\", and grows up to be a great hero.<ref name=Vanita94>Vanita & Kidwai (2001), p. 94</ref>\n\nThe Tamil text ''Kanda Puranam'' narrates about the birth of Shasta identified with Aiyanar. The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva's ''[[Shakti]]'' (wife and power) Parvati in a male form. The legend begins with Shiva's request and Vishnu's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form, that he assumed for the distribution of amrita. Shiva falls in love with Mohini and proposes a union with her. Mohini-Vishnu declines saying that union of two same gender women was unfruitful. Shiva informs Mohini-Vishnu that he was just one of forms of his Shakti. Thereafter, their union resulted in the birth of a dark boy with red locks, who was named Hariharaputra. Further, he was also known as Shasta and Aiyannar.<ref name=\"Dani\u00e9lou\"/><ref name=\"kandha\"/>\n\nIn the ''[[Agni Purana]]'', as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, drops of his energy from his eyes falls on the ground and become ''[[linga]]s'', Shiva's symbols. His energy also generates the monkey-god [[Hanuman]], who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana.<ref name=\"Pattanaik_74\">Pattanaik (2001), p. 74</ref> [[Shiva Purana]] says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was collected and poured into the ear of [[A\u00f1jan\u0101]], who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva.<ref name=\"Dani\u00e9lou\"/> The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kodaganallur Ramaswami Srinivasa Iyengar|title=Asian variations in Ramayana  |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU92nFk5fU4C&pg=PA268&dq=mohini+ramayana&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=1#v=onepage&q=mohini&f=false}}</ref> Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.<ref name = \"Shiva\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale continues with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka (\"eldest brother\") remains intact.<ref name=\"holt\"/> Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.\n\n[[File:Wood carving detail2 - Vishnu Mohini.jpg|thumb|left|Mohini seduces the sages.

Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are performing rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva takes the form of an attractive young beggar ([[Bhikshatana]]) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva.

Aravan agrees to become the sacrificial victim for the ''Kalappali'' (\"sacrifice to the battlefield\") to ensure the victory of the [[Pandavas]], his father, and his uncles. Before being sacrificed to goddess [[Kali]], Aravan asks three boons from Krishna, the guide of the Pandavas. The third boon was that Aravan should be married before the sacrifice so that he could get the right of cremation and funerary offerings (bachelors were buried). This third boon, however, is found only in the folk cults. To fulfill this wish in the Kuttantavar cult myth, Krishna turns into Mohini, marries Aravan, and spends the night with him.

She is portrayed as a <nowiki>''femme fatale''</nowiki>, an enchantress, who maddens lovers, sometimes leading them to their doom. Mohini is introduced into the [[Hindu mythology]] in the narrative epic of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

These tales relate, among other things, the birth of the god [[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] and the destruction of [[Bhasmasura]], the ash-demon.

Nontok misuses a divine weapon given to him by Shiva. The four-armed Mohini-Vishnu enchants Nontok and then attacks him. In his last moments, the demon accuses Vishnu of foul play saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then attacked him. Vishnu decrees that in his next birth, Nontok will be born as the ten-headed demon [[Ravana]] and Vishnu will be a mortal man called [[Rama]]. He will then fight him and defeat him.<ref name = \"P67\"/>\n\nIn a lesser-known tale in the ''[[Ganesha Purana]]'' (900\u20131400 CE) the wise asura king Virochana is rewarded a magical crown by the sun-god [[Surya]]. The crown shields him against all harm. Vishnu as Mohini then enchants Virochana and steals his crown.

The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna takes the form of the beautiful Mohini and marries him.

Shiva is overcome by [[K\u0101ma]] (love and desire) in this version of mythology. Shiva's unfailing energy falls from his eye on the ground creating ores of silver and gold. Vishnu then states that emotions are difficult to overcome, and states that Maya will become a half of Shiva's Ardhanarisvara aspect. Shiva then extols Vishnu's power.<ref name=\"jarow\"/><ref name=\"Goudriaan pp. 42\u201343\"/>\n \nThe ''[[Tripura Rahasya|Tripurarahasya]]'', a south Indian [[Shakta]] text, retells the story, giving more importance to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears that he may be burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the supreme ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess [[Tripura Sundari|Tripura]], who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his energy spills from his eyes, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.<ref name = \"G43\">Goudriaan p. 43</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' when the wandering sage [[Narada]] tells Shiva about Vishnu's Mohini form that deluded the demons, Shiva dismisses him. Shiva and his wife Parvati go to Vishnu's home. Shiva asks him to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Vishnu smiles, again meditates on the Goddess of Shri Lalita Mahatripurasundari and transforms himself into Mohini. Overcome by desire, Shiva embraces Mohini to discharge his seed from his eyes which falls on the ground leading to the birth the god Maha-[[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] (\"The Great Teacher\"). Mohini disappears, while Shiva returns home with Parvati.<ref>Doniger (1999) pp. 263\u201365</ref><ref name=Vanita69>Vanita & Kidwai (2001), p. 69</ref> While the narrative of events vary widely, the events are generally interpreted as \"leela\" between the Gods leading to the creation of Shasta, who was to be born of Shiva and Vishnu to defeat the evil Mahishasuri.\n\nShasta is identified primarily with two regional deities: [[Ayyappan|Ayyappa]] from [[Kerala]] and the Tamil [[Aiyanar]]. He is also identified with the classical Hindu gods [[Murugan|Skanda]] and [[Hanuman]].<ref name = \"D64\">Doniger (1999) p. 264</ref> One of the variants of the story says that instead of a biological origin, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's energy, which is discharged upon embracing Mohini.<ref>Pattanaik (2001), p. 76</ref> Ayyappa is referred to as ''Hariharaputra'', \"the son of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara)\", and grows up to be a great hero.<ref name=Vanita94>Vanita & Kidwai (2001), p. 94</ref>\n\nThe Tamil text ''Kanda Puranam'' narrates about the birth of Shasta identified with Aiyanar. The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva's ''[[Shakti]]'' (wife and power) Parvati in a male form. The legend begins with Shiva's request and Vishnu's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form, that he assumed for the distribution of amrita. Shiva falls in love with Mohini and proposes a union with her. Mohini-Vishnu declines saying that union of two same gender women was unfruitful. Shiva informs Mohini-Vishnu that he was just one of forms of his Shakti. Thereafter, their union resulted in the birth of a dark boy with red locks, who was named Hariharaputra. Further, he was also known as Shasta and Aiyannar.<ref name=\"Dani\u00e9lou\"/><ref name=\"kandha\"/>\n\nIn the ''[[Agni Purana]]'', as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, drops of his energy from his eyes falls on the ground and become ''[[linga]]s'', Shiva's symbols. His energy also generates the monkey-god [[Hanuman]], who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana.<ref name=\"Pattanaik_74\">Pattanaik (2001), p. 74</ref> [[Shiva Purana]] says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was collected and poured into the ear of [[A\u00f1jan\u0101]], who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva.<ref name=\"Dani\u00e9lou\"/> The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kodaganallur Ramaswami Srinivasa Iyengar|title=Asian variations in Ramayana  |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU92nFk5fU4C&pg=PA268&dq=mohini+ramayana&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=1#v=onepage&q=mohini&f=false}}</ref> Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.<ref name = \"Shiva\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale continues with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka (\"eldest brother\") remains intact.<ref name=\"holt\"/> Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.\n\n[[File:Wood carving detail2 - Vishnu Mohini.jpg|thumb|left|Mohini seduces the sages.

The sages pray to her, as their phalluses point to her.]]\n\nMohini plays a lesser role in a Shaiva legend in the ''[[Skanda Purana]]''. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are performing rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva takes the form of an attractive young beggar ([[Bhikshatana]]) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva.

Aravan agrees to become the sacrificial victim for the ''Kalappali'' (\"sacrifice to the battlefield\") to ensure the victory of the [[Pandavas]], his father, and his uncles. Before being sacrificed to goddess [[Kali]], Aravan asks three boons from Krishna, the guide of the Pandavas. The third boon was that Aravan should be married before the sacrifice so that he could get the right of cremation and funerary offerings (bachelors were buried). This third boon, however, is found only in the folk cults. To fulfill this wish in the Kuttantavar cult myth, Krishna turns into Mohini, marries Aravan, and spends the night with him. Then after the sacrifice, Mohini laments Aravan's death, breaking her bangles, beating her breasts, and discarding her bridal finery. She then returns to the original form of Krishna.<ref name = \"Hiltebeitel322ff\">Hiltebeitel (1988) pp. 322\u20134</ref> The legend of the marriage of Aravan and Krishna in his female form as Mohini, and Mohini-Krishna's widowhood after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an eighteen-day annual festival in the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil month]] of Cittirai (April\u2013May) at Koovagam.

Mohini is a disillusion, Vishnu's ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''.<ref name = \"P67\">Pattanaik (2001), p. 67</ref>\n\nStories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to \"suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction\".<ref name=Vanita70>Vanita & Kidwai (2001), p. 70</ref> Pattanaik writes while Westerners may interpret the Shiva-Mohini union as homosexual, traditional Hindus do not agree to this interpretation.<ref name=\"Pattanaik_16\">Pattanaik (2001), pp. 16\u201317</ref> He also writes that those focusing only on homoeroticism miss the narrative's deeper metaphysical significance: Mohini's femininity represents the material aspect of reality, and Mohini's seduction is another attempt to induce the ascetic Shiva into taking an interest in worldly matters. Only Vishnu has the power to \"enchant\" Shiva; a demon who tried to enchant and hurt Shiva in form of a woman was killed in the attempt.<ref name=\"Pattanaik_73\">Pattanaik (2001), p. 73</ref>\n\nAnother interpretation posits that the Mohini tale suggests that Vishnu's ''maya'' blinds even supernatural beings. Mohini is \"the impersonation of the magically delusive nature of existence which fetters all beings to the rounds of births and deaths and vicissitudes of life.\"<ref name = \"G44\"/> Mohini also does not have an independent existence; she exists only as a temporary delusion, and is absorbed back into Vishnu after serving her purpose.<ref name = \"D64\"/>\n\nThe legend of the union of Mohini-Vishnu and Shiva may also be written as part of the desire to have a common child of the two cosmic patriarchs of Hinduism.<ref name = \"D273\">Dongier p. 273</ref>\n\n==Worship==\n\nOn the fifth day of [[Brahmotsavam]], [[Venkateshwara]] is dressed as Mohini and paraded in a grand procession.<ref name=\"Pattanaik65\">Pattanaik (2001). p. 65.</ref>\n\nIn [[Goa]], Mohini is worshipped as [[Mahalasa]] or Mahalasa Narayani.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;...

Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives.

The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels.

The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30.

Finding the game too difficult to play through during testing, he created a cheat code to give the player a full set of power-ups (normally attained gradually throughout the game).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> After entering the sequence using the controller when the game was paused the player received all available power-ups. The mistake was discovered after the release, but developers decided to leave it there, as removing it could result in new bugs and glitches. The sequence was easy enough to remember for testers and simultaneously sufficiently hard to enter accidentally during the gameplay for unsuspecting users.\n\nThe Konami Code was thus included in the series' other [[sequel]]s and spin-offs, with some key differences:\n* In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version of ''[[Gradius III]]'', the original code destroys the player's ship. However, replacing {{key press|\u2190}} and {{key press|\u2192}} with the {{key press|L}} and {{key press|R}} triggers of the SNES controller powers up the ship.\n* In the most recent iteration of the series\u2014''[[Gradius Rebirth]]'' on the Wii\u2014the [[Wii Remote]]'s {{key press|1}} and {{key press|2}} buttons fill in for {{key press|A}} and {{key press|B}}, respectively.\n\nThe code has been subsequently re-used in a large number of [[#List of Konami code games|other games]] and a varied version of the code is now used in the Opera Browser to activate hidden advanced settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techdows.com/2014/06/use-konami-code-to-enable-power-user-settings-in-opera.html|title=Use Konami Code to Enable Power User Settings in Opera - Techdows|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Variations of the Konami Code==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2017}} \nThe original version of the cheat code was designed for the NES controller. The exact sequence varies from game to game and has been adapted to fit the button layouts of different [[video game console]]s, mostly the {{key press|A}} and {{key press|B}} buttons. For example:\n* Any code for a [[PlayStation]] controller, which uses shapes instead of letters, would use \"{{pskeypress|X}}, {{pskeypress|O}}\", appearing even in Konami's ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' series, input on the dance pad.\n* In mobile phone games by Konami, they are replaced by {{key press|5}} {{key press|7}} {{key press|3}} on the numerical pad, which is the [[goroawase]] pronunciation for \"konami\"; 5 is pronounced ''go'', 7 can be pronounced ''nana'' or just ''na'' for short, and 3 is usually pronounced as 'san' but has an alternative pronunciation of 'mi'. Together, this becomes go-na-mi.\n* 573 is also used extensively in the [[Dance Dance Revolution]] series; the original board for [[DDR 1stMIX]] (also used in many other Konami designs) was called [[System 573]], the maximum combo in several difficult songs (such as [[MAX 300]]) is 573, highscores often start out at 573 000 or similar, and so on.\n\nThese deviations may occur for purely operational reasons (e.g., if the code must be entered while the game is paused, the code might be altered to avoid resuming), to keep powerful upgrades better concealed while still referencing Konami, or through a programming error.\n\nCuriously, the \"B\" and \"A\" buttons were switched for the code when used in the 1991 NES game ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/563469-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-the-manhattan/cheats|title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project Cheats, Codes, and Secrets for NES - GameFAQs|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite the differences, though, these codes are still often referred to in general discussion as \"Konami Code\", \"Conami Kode\", or, less commonly, \"Pseudo-Konami Code\".\n\nA common misconception is that the code ends with Start or Select Start. In many titles, the player must press Start after entering the code in order to start a game, or press Select to switch to two-player mode and then start the game, leading to the confusion.\n\n== List of Konami code games ==\n\n===''Gradius'' series===\n*'''''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''''' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]]) \u2013 The first use of the code.

However, if the player enters the code and substitutes the {{key press|L}} and {{key press|R}} buttons for {{key press|Left}} and {{key press|Right}}, the powerups are applied without penalty.  Entering {{key press|Down}}{{key press|Down}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|Right}}{{key press|Left}}{{key press|Right}}{{key press|Left}}{{key press|A}}{{key press|B}} will result in full powerups, but subtracts one life per use.  {{key press|Down}}{{key press|Down}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|R}}{{key press|L}}{{key press|R}}{{key press|L}}{{key press|A}}{{key press|B}} gives full powerups followed shortly by self-destruction.\n*'''''[[Gradius IV Fukkatsu]]''''' ([[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]) \u2013 Pausing the game and entering the code activates all powerups except for Speed Up and Double.\n*'''''[[Gradius V]]''''' ([[PlayStation 2|PS2]]) \u2013 Pressing {{key press|Up}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|Down}}{{key press|Down}}{{key press|Left}}{{key press|Right}}{{key press|Left}}{{key press|Right}}{{key press|L1}}{{key press|R1}} while paused gives full powerups, including the Laser weapon.

If the two-player option is picked using the {{key press|Select}} button before or after entering the code, both players will have 30 lives. In the Japanese version, the 30 lives code can be used alongside a stage select code exclusive to that version. The codes were removed from the special ''Contra 4'' version.\n* '''''[[Super Contra|Super C]]''''' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]) \u2013 Entering the code({{key press|Right}}{{key press|Left}}{{key press|Down}}{{key press|Up}}{{key press|A}}{{key press|B}}{{key press|Start}}) before the title screen appears, gives the player 10 lives in US version of the game while in Japanese version the code gives 30 lives. If the two-player option is picked using the {{key press|Select}} button before or after entering the code, both players will have 10 lives. This is different than the original game which offered 30 lives to a player. The codes were removed from the special ''Contra 4'' version. To access sound mode in Japanese/US version enter the code Hold({{key press|A}}{{key press|B}}) and press {{key press|Start}}.

Entering the code with the normal buttons during play in the Pause menu will power-up whatever weapons the player is currently carrying. The code can only be entered once per stage, as inputting it a second time will kill off the player, taking away a life. This code has no effect on the Easy setting, where all the weapons picked by the player are upgraded by default.

Finding the game too difficult to play through during testing, he created a cheat code to give the player a full set of power-ups (normally attained gradually throughout the game).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> After entering the sequence using the controller when the game was paused the player received all available power-ups. The mistake was discovered after the release, but developers decided to leave it there, as removing it could result in new bugs and glitches. The sequence was easy enough to remember for testers and simultaneously sufficiently hard to enter accidentally during the gameplay for unsuspecting users.\n\nThe Konami Code was thus included in the series' other [[sequel]]s and spin-offs, with some key differences:\n* In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] version of ''[[Gradius III]]'', the original code destroys the player's ship. However, replacing {{key press|\u2190}} and {{key press|\u2192}} with the {{key press|L}} and {{key press|R}} triggers of the SNES controller powers up the ship.\n* In the most recent iteration of the series\u2014''[[Gradius Rebirth]]'' on the Wii\u2014the [[Wii Remote]]'s {{key press|1}} and {{key press|2}} buttons fill in for {{key press|A}} and {{key press|B}}, respectively.\n\nThe code has been subsequently re-used in a large number of [[#List of Konami code games|other games]] and a varied version of the code is now used in the Opera Browser to activate hidden advanced settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techdows.com/2014/06/use-konami-code-to-enable-power-user-settings-in-opera.html|title=Use Konami Code to Enable Power User Settings in Opera - Techdows|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Variations of the Konami Code==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2017}} \nThe original version of the cheat code was designed for the NES controller. The exact sequence varies from game to game and has been adapted to fit the button layouts of different [[video game console]]s, mostly the {{key press|A}} and {{key press|B}} buttons. For example:\n* Any code for a [[PlayStation]] controller, which uses shapes instead of letters, would use \"{{pskeypress|X}}, {{pskeypress|O}}\", appearing even in Konami's ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' series, input on the dance pad.\n* In mobile phone games by Konami, they are replaced by {{key press|5}} {{key press|7}} {{key press|3}} on the numerical pad, which is the [[goroawase]] pronunciation for \"konami\"; 5 is pronounced ''go'', 7 can be pronounced ''nana'' or just ''na'' for short, and 3 is usually pronounced as 'san' but has an alternative pronunciation of 'mi'. Together, this becomes go-na-mi.\n* 573 is also used extensively in the [[Dance Dance Revolution]] series; the original board for [[DDR 1stMIX]] (also used in many other Konami designs) was called [[System 573]], the maximum combo in several difficult songs (such as [[MAX 300]]) is 573, highscores often start out at 573 000 or similar, and so on.\n\nThese deviations may occur for purely operational reasons (e.g., if the code must be entered while the game is paused, the code might be altered to avoid resuming), to keep powerful upgrades better concealed while still referencing Konami, or through a programming error.\n\nCuriously, the \"B\" and \"A\" buttons were switched for the code when used in the 1991 NES game ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/563469-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-the-manhattan/cheats|title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project Cheats, Codes, and Secrets for NES - GameFAQs|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite the differences, though, these codes are still often referred to in general discussion as \"Konami Code\", \"Conami Kode\", or, less commonly, \"Pseudo-Konami Code\".\n\nA common misconception is that the code ends with Start or Select Start. In many titles, the player must press Start after entering the code in order to start a game, or press Select to switch to two-player mode and then start the game, leading to the confusion.\n\n== List of Konami code games ==\n\n===''Gradius'' series===\n*'''''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]''''' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]]) \u2013 The first use of the code.

He scored 12 Grand Prix wins and six pole positions. In [[1981 Formula One season|1981]] while driving for [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] he finished second in the World Drivers' Championship by one point, having been overtaken in the [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|last race of the season]]. Reutemann also finished in third overall three times for three separate teams, {{f1|1975}} for [[Brabham]], {{f1|1978}} for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and {{f1|1980}} for Williams. To date he is the latest Argentine driver to win a [[List of Formula One Grand Prix winners|Grand Prix]].\n\nIn terms of race wins, his final Ferrari season in 1978 was his most successful with four wins, but he fell short to the consistency of the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] team with [[Mario Andretti]] and the late [[Ronnie Peterson]] and was not in championship contention to the final race. He finished third, just behind Peterson, who had died in an [[1978 Italian Grand Prix|accident at Monza]] earlier that autumn. In 1981, Reutemann instead relied on consistency, but narrowly lost out to [[Nelson Piquet]] for the title.\n\nHe became the second Formula One driver after [[Leo Kinnunen]] to be at the podium of a [[World Rally Championship]] event, when he finished third in the 1980 and 1985 editions of [[Rally Argentina]]. He was also for three decades the only Formula One driver to score drivers' championship points in both F1 and WRC, until [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]'s eighth place at the [[2010 Jordan Rally]].<ref>{{cite web | title=R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen teki suomalaista moottoriurheiluhistoriaa! | work=[[MTV3]] | url=http://www.mtv3.fi/urheilu/ralli/uutiset.shtml/arkistot/ralli/2010/04/1092971 | date=3 April 2010 | accessdate=3 April 2010 | language=Finnish}}</ref>\n\nAs a popular governor and a [[Argentine Senate|senator]], he has been considered by some, on several occasions, to be a worthy candidate for [[President of Argentina|President]], but while he considered running for president in the [[2011 Argentine general election]] he declined to do so.<ref>http://en.mercopress.com/2011/05/24/reutemann-says-cfk-will-seek-re-election-and-downplays-clashes-with-organized-labour</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Early years===\nDescended from a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-[[Germany|German]] grandfather, an Argentine father and an [[Italy|Italian]] mother, Reutemann was the first successful Argentine Formula One driver since the retirement of five-time World Champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] in 1958. He first raced in 1965 in a [[Fiat]] saloon car.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Lole: a natural on the loose\" by John Davenport, [[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] June 2007</ref> After racing touring cars and [[Formula 2]] in Argentina, he moved to Europe in 1970 to drive a [[Brabham]] for the Automobile Club of Argentina Team in the European Formula 2 series. He immediately received attention when he took out [[Austria]]n Formula One driver [[Jochen Rindt]] (that year's eventual posthumous World Champion) on the first lap of his first race at [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]], but carried on to finish fourth. The next season, he finished a close second in the series to [[Sweden]]'s [[Ronnie Peterson]].\n\n===Formula One: early years===\n[[File:1974 Brands Hatch Race of Champions Reutemann Brabham BT44.jpg|thumb|right|Reutemann at the wheel of the [[Brabham BT44]] during the 1974 [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]] at [[Brands Hatch]], [[England]].]]\nBrabham F1 team boss [[Bernie Ecclestone]] signed Reutemann to drive alongside veteran and two-time World Champion [[Graham Hill]] for the [[1972 Formula One season|1972 season]]. At the [[1972 Argentine Grand Prix|first race]], in front of his home crowd at [[Buenos Aires]] for his first Grand Prix, Reutemann qualified his Brabham BT34 on pole position. This was a feat previously performed only by [[Mario Andretti]], and since matched only by [[Jacques Villeneuve]]; his teammate Hill qualified 16th. He finished the race in seventh after having to pit to replace his soft tyres, and the main highlight for the rest of the year was his win in the non-Championship Interlagos Grand Prix.\n\n[[File:Carlos Reutemann Walkins Glen Ferrari 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Reutemann driving his Ferrari [[Ferrari 312T|312T3]] to victory at the [[1978 United States Grand Prix|1978 USA Grand Prix]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], [[New York State|New York]].]]\nTeamed with Brazilian [[Wilson Fittipaldi J\u00fanior]] for the [[1973 Formula One season|1973 season]], Reutemann scored two podium finishes and seventh in the Drivers' Championship in the tiny but radical [[Gordon Murray]]-designed BT42. For [[1974 Formula One season|1974]], Murray designed the [[Brabham BT44|BT44]], which was a further improvement and the team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship. Reutemann took the first three victories of his F1 career at [[1974 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], [[1974 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] and the [[1974 United States Grand Prix|United States]]. He might have won the first race of the year in [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]], too, but the Brabham team apparently failed to properly fuel his car and he ran out of fuel with less than two laps to go while safely in the lead. Though he matched Drivers' Champion [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]'s win total, inconsistent performances in the other races left Reutemann sixth in the season standings.\n\n[[File:Reutemann Monaco 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Reutemann driving the [[Lotus 79]] at the [[1979 Monaco Grand Prix]].]]\nFive podium finishes in [[1975 Formula One season|1975]], including a win in [[1975 German Grand Prix|Germany]] at the old 14-mile [[N\u00fcrburgring]] allowed Reutemann to place third in that year's Championship. The Brabham team switched to the [[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]] flat-12 engine for [[1976 Formula One season|1976]] and suffered from serious reliability problems. After seven retirements and only one finish in the points (fourth place in [[1976 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]) in the first twelve races, Reutemann negotiated a release from his Brabham contract to sign with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], who was looking for a temporary replacement for the injured [[Niki Lauda]]. Lauda's unexpected speedy recovery resulted in Reutemann racing only once for the team, in a third car at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and then sitting out for the final three races.\n\nFor the [[1977 Formula One season|1977]] Ferrari opted to keep the now fully recovered Lauda and have Reutemann replacing [[Clay Regazzoni]], who moved on to the [[Ensign (racing team)|Ensign team]]. In the first two races, Reutemann finished third in [[1977 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] and won in [[1977 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], outdriving Lauda in both events and taking the Championship lead. For the Brazilian race, Ferrari had just designed a new rear wing that was put on Reutemann's car and not Lauda's, so Reutemann went into this Brazilian GP with a performance advantage and a psychological high- the psychological aspect being crucial to how Reutemann would perform in the race. Reutemann would later state in an interview that this was his best race. Over the course of the season, however, Lauda reaffirmed his position as team leader, and the Austrian won his second Championship, while Reutemann finished fourth and did not win another race that year.\n\nWhen Lauda moved to Brabham in [[1978 Formula One season|1978]], Reutemann became the senior member of the Ferrari team, joined by the young [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Gilles Villeneuve]]. Reutemann used the [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari 312T2]] to win in [[1978 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], and a [[Ferrari 312T|312T3]] to win in [[1978 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and twice in the United States ([[1978 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach]] and [[1978 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]]). However, the [[Team Lotus|Lotus team]] was dominant once their new [[Lotus 79|model 79]] was introduced at [[1978 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and Reutemann finished a close third in the points standings behind Andretti and Peterson.\n\nWith an opening at Lotus in [[1979 Formula One season|1979]] after the death of Ronnie Peterson, Reutemann decided to move from Ferrari to Lotus. The first few races went well for him \u2013 highlights being forceful second places in Argentina and Spain, plus third places at Brazil and Monaco \u2013 but, as the season wore on, the team struggled while [[Jody Scheckter]] won the title for Ferrari. After four podiums and six points finishes in the first seven races,  Reutemann  ended up finishing in only seventh place for the season. It was unfortunate that Reutemann left Ferrari for the 1979 season because with the introduction of the model T4 Ferrari was able to make a big comeback and place its pilots in 1st and 2nd place in the final standings of the season.\n\n===Formula One: career at Williams===\n[[File:Reutemann and Williams at 1981 Dutch Grand Prix additional crop.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Reutemann with Frank Williams at Zandvoort in 1981.]]\nJoining the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team for [[1980 Formula One season|1980]] put him back in a competitive car once again- the very quick [[Williams FW07|FW07]] car. The season started off badly for the patriotic Argentinean- he failed to win his home Grand Prix in [[Buenos Aires]] (which was the first race of the season; this was a feat he would never accomplish) after his car suffered engine failure. Reutemann got out of the car, took off his helmet, sat down next to his car and burst into tears in full view of cameras broadcasting the race worldwide and in front of the 80,000 spectators at the track. But the season got much better as he would win at [[1980 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and score eight podiums throughout the year to finish third in the Championship. His partnership with number one driver and World Champion [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]] was productive for Williams, who won their first Constructors' Championship with a then-record 120 points. Reutemann's relationship with his teammate soured when, the following season, Reutemann disobeyed the team's orders and thereby refused to allow Jones to win the [[1981 Brazilian Grand Prix]]. Jones never forgave this act of disobedience on the part of his teammate, while Reutemann felt frustrated at Jones' refusal to acknowledge his help, especially after having just given him the victory at the [[1981 USA West Grand Prix]]. Reutemann continued to score more points than Jones throughout the remainder of the season, and the Brazilian victory (and another in [[1981 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]]) helped put him in a position to challenge for the title in a three-way battle with [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] at the season-ending race in [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|Las Vegas]]. In what was probably a defining moment of the season, Reutemann was ordered at the 1981 Germany Grand Prix to turn over his unit to teammate Jones for the race due to the later car's failure and had to race with the third unit of the team. That proved disastrous when his engine failed, preventing him from scoring points in a race where he had qualified in 3rd place.<ref>{{Citation|title=1981 German Grand Prix|date=2019-09-10|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1981_German_Grand_Prix&oldid=915050010|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nReutemann arrived in Las Vegas with a one-point lead in the Championship over [[Brazil]]ian [[Nelson Piquet]]. He began the race from pole position, ahead of Jones, who had vowed not to provide any \"help\" in Reutemann's quest, while Piquet was fourth. At the start, Jones jumped into the lead and Reutemann was quickly passed by Villeneuve, [[Alain Prost]] and [[Bruno Giacomelli]].\n\nOn lap 17, battling over seventh place as they approached the last left-hander before the pits, Piquet's Brabham was nearly touching the back of Reutemann's Williams. Piquet got around Reutemann on the inside when Reutemann, fighting for the Championship, braked early.  On the next lap, Andretti also went by Reutemann. Piquet put himself in a position to score points when he took over sixth place from [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] on lap 22. Reutemann continued to slip backwards with gearbox trouble, having lost fourth gear as early as lap two. Reutemann finished the race in eighth, a lap down, and the title went to Piquet. However, if that year's season opener, the [[1981 South African Grand Prix]], which had been run as a Formula Libre race and one which Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Renault and Ligier didn\u2018t attend, had been a race with World Championship Points awarded, Reutemann would have been World Champion with 58 Points against Piquet's 56. He returned with Williams for [[1982 Formula One season|1982]], finishing  second in the [[1982 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], the only Cosworth-engined runner able to take the fight to the much more powerful turbo-engined Renaults. The [[Falklands War]], however, generated a tense political period between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and Reutemann chose to distance himself from the team and retire after the [[1982 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian race]].<ref name=\"C+SC30\">{{cite journal | journal = Classic & Sports Car | title = The Commodore 64, Compact Discs and F1 drivers on strike: welcome to 1982 | last = Fearnley | first = Paul | page = 237 |date=April 2012 | publisher = Haymarket | location = Teddington, Middlesex, UK | issn = 0263-3183 }}</ref> In light of the further developments that took place in Reutemann's life, many felt that his decision to terminate his racing career was made with an eye to his future in politics.

In 1985 he accepted another offer to drive the Argentinian Rally, this time by [[Peugeot]].

He won the election and ran the province for one four-year term (1991\u20131995). The provincial constitution does not allow for re-election, but after four years Reutemann presented again and won the governorship for the period 1999\u20132003. During those years, his profile grew and he became one of the leading politicians in Santa Fe and in Argentina.\n\nReutemann's second term was marked by the nationwide economic problems brought by the [[recession]] that had started in 1999 and ultimately led to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|socioeconomic crash]] of 2001. Under Reutemann, Santa Fe kept a conservative fiscal policy, whereby it applied discounts and froze public workers' salaries and pensions through an Economic Emergency Law. The province was among the few not to resort to the issue of government bonds as a form of quasi-currency, and thus did not become highly indebted.\n\nAfter the 2001 crash and the resignation of [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], Reutemann surprised and disappointed many by declining, on several occasions, to run for president. He finally presented himself for the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 general election]] and won a seat in the [[Argentine Senate|National Senate]], which he occupies at present.\n\nDuring the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|2005 legislative elections]] Reutemann chose not to be a major participant in the campaign. After the PJ lost to the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] candidates for the first time in Santa Fe, members of the party were rumored to be unhappy about Reutemann's low profile. Reutemann also declined to run for governor of Santa Fe again in the [[Elections in Argentina, 2007|2007 elections]].<ref>[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/12/13/politica/noticia_350508.shtml]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 2006 Reutemann was named ''Commendatore della Repubblica'' by [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Italian Republic]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]].\n\nDuring a session in the Argentinian Senate on 17 July 2008, Reutemann presented an alternative project for the Commission of Agriculture in opposition to the one of then Vice-President [[Julio Cobos]]. His project didn't pass, and on February 2009 he renounced to his role in the Bloque Parlamentario del Frente para la Victoria to create his own political fraction, \"Santa Fe Federal\", with the intention of protecting the interests of the province.\n\nHe was reelected to the Senate both in 2009 and 2015, when he formed part of the Cambiemos alliance nationally and supported Mauricio Macri in the presidential election. His mandate expires in 2021.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons|Carlos Reutemann}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{succession box\n| title=[[Formula Two|Argentine Formula Two Champion]]\n| before=[[Pablo Brea]] | after=[[Osvaldo Bessia]] \n| years= 1969 \n}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[V\u00edctor Reviglio]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Governor of Santa Fe]]|years=1991\u20131995}}\n{{s-aft|rows=2|after=[[Jorge Obeid]] }}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Jorge Obeid]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Governor of Santa Fe]]|years=1999\u20132003}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Scuderia Ferrari}}\n{{Team Lotus}}\n{{Williams}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reutemann, Carlos}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Argentine racing drivers]]\n[[Category:Argentine Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Brabham Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Ferrari Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Team Lotus Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Williams Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:European Formula Two Championship drivers]]\n[[Category:Turismo Carretera drivers]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers]]\n[[Category:Argentine sportsperson-politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Argentine Senate]]\n[[Category:Governors of Santa Fe Province]]\n[[Category:People from Santa Fe, Argentina]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Swiss-German descent]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Justicialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Argentine rally drivers]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship drivers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox racing driver\n| name = Carlos Reutemann \n| image = [[File:Reutemann 1981.jpg|200px]]\n| caption = Reutemann at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in 1981.\n| nationality = {{flagicon|ARG}} Argentine \n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1942|04|12|df=y}} \n| birth_place = [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], Argentina \n| record template1  = \n{{Infobox F1 driver|embed=yes\n| Years = {{F1|1972}}\u2013{{F1|1982}} \n| Team(s) = [[Brabham]], [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] \n| Races = 146 \n| Championships = 0 (Best Result: 2nd in [[1981 FIA Formula One World Championship|1981]])\n| Wins = 12 \n| Podiums = 45 \n| Points = 298 (310)<ref name=\"droppedpoints\">Up until {{F1|1990}}, not all points scored by a driver contributed to their final World Championship tally (see [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|list of points scoring systems]] for more information).

He scored 12 Grand Prix wins and six pole positions. In [[1981 Formula One season|1981]] while driving for [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] he finished second in the World Drivers' Championship by one point, having been overtaken in the [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|last race of the season]]. Reutemann also finished in third overall three times for three separate teams, {{f1|1975}} for [[Brabham]], {{f1|1978}} for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and {{f1|1980}} for Williams. To date he is the latest Argentine driver to win a [[List of Formula One Grand Prix winners|Grand Prix]].\n\nIn terms of race wins, his final Ferrari season in 1978 was his most successful with four wins, but he fell short to the consistency of the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] team with [[Mario Andretti]] and the late [[Ronnie Peterson]] and was not in championship contention to the final race. He finished third, just behind Peterson, who had died in an [[1978 Italian Grand Prix|accident at Monza]] earlier that autumn. In 1981, Reutemann instead relied on consistency, but narrowly lost out to [[Nelson Piquet]] for the title.\n\nHe became the second Formula One driver after [[Leo Kinnunen]] to be at the podium of a [[World Rally Championship]] event, when he finished third in the 1980 and 1985 editions of [[Rally Argentina]]. He was also for three decades the only Formula One driver to score drivers' championship points in both F1 and WRC, until [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]'s eighth place at the [[2010 Jordan Rally]].<ref>{{cite web | title=R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen teki suomalaista moottoriurheiluhistoriaa! | work=[[MTV3]] | url=http://www.mtv3.fi/urheilu/ralli/uutiset.shtml/arkistot/ralli/2010/04/1092971 | date=3 April 2010 | accessdate=3 April 2010 | language=Finnish}}</ref>\n\nAs a popular governor and a [[Argentine Senate|senator]], he has been considered by some, on several occasions, to be a worthy candidate for [[President of Argentina|President]], but while he considered running for president in the [[2011 Argentine general election]] he declined to do so.<ref>http://en.mercopress.com/2011/05/24/reutemann-says-cfk-will-seek-re-election-and-downplays-clashes-with-organized-labour</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Early years===\nDescended from a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-[[Germany|German]] grandfather, an Argentine father and an [[Italy|Italian]] mother, Reutemann was the first successful Argentine Formula One driver since the retirement of five-time World Champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] in 1958. He first raced in 1965 in a [[Fiat]] saloon car.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Lole: a natural on the loose\" by John Davenport, [[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] June 2007</ref> After racing touring cars and [[Formula 2]] in Argentina, he moved to Europe in 1970 to drive a [[Brabham]] for the Automobile Club of Argentina Team in the European Formula 2 series. He immediately received attention when he took out [[Austria]]n Formula One driver [[Jochen Rindt]] (that year's eventual posthumous World Champion) on the first lap of his first race at [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]], but carried on to finish fourth. The next season, he finished a close second in the series to [[Sweden]]'s [[Ronnie Peterson]].\n\n===Formula One: early years===\n[[File:1974 Brands Hatch Race of Champions Reutemann Brabham BT44.jpg|thumb|right|Reutemann at the wheel of the [[Brabham BT44]] during the 1974 [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]] at [[Brands Hatch]], [[England]].]]\nBrabham F1 team boss [[Bernie Ecclestone]] signed Reutemann to drive alongside veteran and two-time World Champion [[Graham Hill]] for the [[1972 Formula One season|1972 season]]. At the [[1972 Argentine Grand Prix|first race]], in front of his home crowd at [[Buenos Aires]] for his first Grand Prix, Reutemann qualified his Brabham BT34 on pole position. This was a feat previously performed only by [[Mario Andretti]], and since matched only by [[Jacques Villeneuve]]; his teammate Hill qualified 16th. He finished the race in seventh after having to pit to replace his soft tyres, and the main highlight for the rest of the year was his win in the non-Championship Interlagos Grand Prix.\n\n[[File:Carlos Reutemann Walkins Glen Ferrari 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Reutemann driving his Ferrari [[Ferrari 312T|312T3]] to victory at the [[1978 United States Grand Prix|1978 USA Grand Prix]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], [[New York State|New York]].]]\nTeamed with Brazilian [[Wilson Fittipaldi J\u00fanior]] for the [[1973 Formula One season|1973 season]], Reutemann scored two podium finishes and seventh in the Drivers' Championship in the tiny but radical [[Gordon Murray]]-designed BT42. For [[1974 Formula One season|1974]], Murray designed the [[Brabham BT44|BT44]], which was a further improvement and the team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship. Reutemann took the first three victories of his F1 career at [[1974 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], [[1974 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] and the [[1974 United States Grand Prix|United States]]. He might have won the first race of the year in [[1974 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]], too, but the Brabham team apparently failed to properly fuel his car and he ran out of fuel with less than two laps to go while safely in the lead. Though he matched Drivers' Champion [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]'s win total, inconsistent performances in the other races left Reutemann sixth in the season standings.\n\n[[File:Reutemann Monaco 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Reutemann driving the [[Lotus 79]] at the [[1979 Monaco Grand Prix]].]]\nFive podium finishes in [[1975 Formula One season|1975]], including a win in [[1975 German Grand Prix|Germany]] at the old 14-mile [[N\u00fcrburgring]] allowed Reutemann to place third in that year's Championship. The Brabham team switched to the [[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]] flat-12 engine for [[1976 Formula One season|1976]] and suffered from serious reliability problems. After seven retirements and only one finish in the points (fourth place in [[1976 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]) in the first twelve races, Reutemann negotiated a release from his Brabham contract to sign with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], who was looking for a temporary replacement for the injured [[Niki Lauda]]. Lauda's unexpected speedy recovery resulted in Reutemann racing only once for the team, in a third car at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and then sitting out for the final three races.\n\nFor the [[1977 Formula One season|1977]] Ferrari opted to keep the now fully recovered Lauda and have Reutemann replacing [[Clay Regazzoni]], who moved on to the [[Ensign (racing team)|Ensign team]]. In the first two races, Reutemann finished third in [[1977 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] and won in [[1977 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], outdriving Lauda in both events and taking the Championship lead. For the Brazilian race, Ferrari had just designed a new rear wing that was put on Reutemann's car and not Lauda's, so Reutemann went into this Brazilian GP with a performance advantage and a psychological high- the psychological aspect being crucial to how Reutemann would perform in the race. Reutemann would later state in an interview that this was his best race. Over the course of the season, however, Lauda reaffirmed his position as team leader, and the Austrian won his second Championship, while Reutemann finished fourth and did not win another race that year.\n\nWhen Lauda moved to Brabham in [[1978 Formula One season|1978]], Reutemann became the senior member of the Ferrari team, joined by the young [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Gilles Villeneuve]]. Reutemann used the [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari 312T2]] to win in [[1978 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], and a [[Ferrari 312T|312T3]] to win in [[1978 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and twice in the United States ([[1978 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach]] and [[1978 United States Grand Prix|Watkins Glen]]). However, the [[Team Lotus|Lotus team]] was dominant once their new [[Lotus 79|model 79]] was introduced at [[1978 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and Reutemann finished a close third in the points standings behind Andretti and Peterson.\n\nWith an opening at Lotus in [[1979 Formula One season|1979]] after the death of Ronnie Peterson, Reutemann decided to move from Ferrari to Lotus. The first few races went well for him \u2013 highlights being forceful second places in Argentina and Spain, plus third places at Brazil and Monaco \u2013 but, as the season wore on, the team struggled while [[Jody Scheckter]] won the title for Ferrari. After four podiums and six points finishes in the first seven races,  Reutemann  ended up finishing in only seventh place for the season.\n\n===Formula One: career at Williams===\n[[File:Reutemann and Williams at 1981 Dutch Grand Prix additional crop.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Reutemann with Frank Williams at Zandvoort in 1981.]]\nJoining the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team for [[1980 Formula One season|1980]] put him back in a competitive car once again- the very quick [[Williams FW07|FW07]] car. The season started off badly for the patriotic Argentinean- he failed to win his home Grand Prix in [[Buenos Aires]] (which was the first race of the season; this was a feat he would never accomplish) after his car suffered engine failure. Reutemann got out of the car, took off his helmet, sat down next to his car and burst into tears in full view of cameras broadcasting the race worldwide and in front of the 80,000 spectators at the track. But the season got much better as he would win at [[1980 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and score eight podiums throughout the year to finish third in the Championship. His partnership with number one driver and World Champion [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]] was productive for Williams, who won their first Constructors' Championship with a then-record 120 points. Reutemann's relationship with his teammate soured when, the following season, Reutemann disobeyed the team's orders and thereby refused to allow Jones to win the [[1981 Brazilian Grand Prix]]. Jones never forgave this act of disobedience on the part of his teammate, while Reutemann felt frustrated at Jones' refusal to acknowledge his help, especially after having just given him the victory at the [[1981 USA West Grand Prix]]. Reutemann continued to score more points than Jones throughout the remainder of the season, and the Brazilian victory (and another in [[1981 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]]) helped put him in a position to challenge for the title in a three-way battle with [[Nelson Piquet]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] at the season-ending race in [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|Las Vegas]].\n\nReutemann arrived in Las Vegas with a one-point lead in the Championship over [[Brazil]]ian [[Nelson Piquet]]. He began the race from pole position, ahead of Jones, who had vowed not to provide any \"help\" in Reutemann's quest, while Piquet was fourth. At the start, Jones jumped into the lead and Reutemann was quickly passed by Villeneuve, [[Alain Prost]] and [[Bruno Giacomelli]].\n\nOn lap 17, battling over seventh place as they approached the last left-hander before the pits, Piquet's Brabham was nearly touching the back of Reutemann's Williams. Piquet got around Reutemann on the inside when Reutemann, fighting for the Championship, braked early.  On the next lap, Andretti also went by Reutemann. Piquet put himself in a position to score points when he took over sixth place from [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] on lap 22. Reutemann continued to slip backwards with gearbox trouble, having lost fourth gear as early as lap two. Reutemann finished the race in eighth, a lap down, and the title went to Piquet. However, if that year's season opener, the [[1981 South African Grand Prix]], which had been run as a Formula Libre race and one which Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Renault and Ligier didn\u2018t attend, had been a race with World Championship Points awarded, Reutemann would have been World Champion with 58 Points against Piquet's 56. He returned with Williams for [[1982 Formula One season|1982]], finishing  second in the [[1982 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], the only Cosworth-engined runner able to take the fight to the much more powerful turbo-engined Renaults. The [[Falklands War]], however, generated a tense political period between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and Reutemann chose to distance himself from the team and retire after the [[1982 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian race]].<ref name=\"C+SC30\">{{cite journal | journal = Classic & Sports Car | title = The Commodore 64, Compact Discs and F1 drivers on strike: welcome to 1982 | last = Fearnley | first = Paul | page = 237 |date=April 2012 | publisher = Haymarket | location = Teddington, Middlesex, UK | issn = 0263-3183 }}</ref> In light of the further developments that took place in Reutemann's life, many felt that his decision to terminate his racing career was made with an eye to his future in politics.

In 1985 he accepted another offer to drive the Argentinian Rally, this time by [[Peugeot]].

He won the election and ran the province for one four-year term (1991\u20131995). The provincial constitution does not allow for re-election, but after four years Reutemann presented again and won the governorship for the period 1999\u20132003. During those years, his profile grew and he became one of the leading politicians in Santa Fe and in Argentina.\n\nReutemann's second term was marked by the nationwide economic problems brought by the [[recession]] that had started in 1999 and ultimately led to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|socioeconomic crash]] of 2001. Under Reutemann, Santa Fe kept a conservative fiscal policy, whereby it applied discounts and froze public workers' salaries and pensions through an Economic Emergency Law. The province was among the few not to resort to the issue of government bonds as a form of quasi-currency, and thus did not become highly indebted.\n\nAfter the 2001 crash and the resignation of [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], Reutemann surprised and disappointed many by declining, on several occasions, to run for president. He finally presented himself for the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 general election]] and won a seat in the [[Argentine Senate|National Senate]], which he occupies at present.\n\nDuring the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|2005 legislative elections]] Reutemann chose not to be a major participant in the campaign. After the PJ lost to the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] candidates for the first time in Santa Fe, members of the party were rumored to be unhappy about Reutemann's low profile. Reutemann also declined to run for governor of Santa Fe again in the [[Elections in Argentina, 2007|2007 elections]].<ref>[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/12/13/politica/noticia_350508.shtml]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 2006 Reutemann was named ''Commendatore della Repubblica'' by [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Italian Republic]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]].\n\nDuring a session in the Argentinian Senate on 17 July 2008, Reutemann presented an alternative project for the Commission of Agriculture in opposition to the one of then Vice-President [[Julio Cobos]]. His project didn't pass, and on February 2009 he renounced to his role in the Bloque Parlamentario del Frente para la Victoria to create his own political fraction, \"Santa Fe Federal\", with the intention of protecting the interests of the province.\n\nHe was reelected to the Senate both in 2009 and 2015, when he formed part of the Cambiemos alliance nationally and supported Mauricio Macri in the presidential election. His mandate expires in 2021.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons|Carlos Reutemann}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{succession box\n| title=[[Formula Two|Argentine Formula Two Champion]]\n| before=[[Pablo Brea]] | after=[[Osvaldo Bessia]] \n| years= 1969 \n}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[V\u00edctor Reviglio]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Governor of Santa Fe]]|years=1991\u20131995}}\n{{s-aft|rows=2|after=[[Jorge Obeid]] }}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Jorge Obeid]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Governor of Santa Fe]]|years=1999\u20132003}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Scuderia Ferrari}}\n{{Team Lotus}}\n{{Williams}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reutemann, Carlos}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Argentine racing drivers]]\n[[Category:Argentine Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Brabham Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Ferrari Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Team Lotus Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:Williams Formula One drivers]]\n[[Category:European Formula Two Championship drivers]]\n[[Category:Turismo Carretera drivers]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers]]\n[[Category:Argentine sportsperson-politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Argentine Senate]]\n[[Category:Governors of Santa Fe Province]]\n[[Category:People from Santa Fe, Argentina]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Swiss-German descent]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Justicialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Argentine rally drivers]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship drivers]]\n", "name_user": "Paul Bluewing", "label": "safe", "comment": "Details about the season's 1979 and 1981 of the racer", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Reutemann"}

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\".

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring.

A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form.
