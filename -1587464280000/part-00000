The lower early 14th-century three stages are of [[Course (architecture)|coursed]] ironstone with limestone ashlar cornerstone dressings; the top late 14th-century stage is entirely ashlar, as are the [[battlement]]s, [[pinnacle]]d at each corner, and the [[crocket]]ed recessed octagonal [[spire]]. The spire is topped by a [[finial]] with [[Weather vane|weathercock]], and at its lower part contains a single run of [[Window#Terms|twin-light]] pointed arch [[lucarne]]s, these on each alternate face,  each set in gables with a globed device attached above. The tower is drained by one [[gargoyle]] centrally placed on each side below the battlements. Each corner is [[buttress]]ed to the full height of the tower on the west side and from the nave and aisles upwards on the east. [[Buttress#Terminology|Clasping buttress]]es run to the top of the third ([[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]]) stage, and angled buttresses run over the fourth. The tower first stage contains one large pointed arch Decorated window, this on the west side, with no [[hood mould]] and plain glazed with twin lights ([[Lancet window|lancets]])  leading to [[trefoil]] heads. The central [[mullion]] runs to an oval [[Rose window|rosette]] with [[quatrefoil]] insets, characteristic of c.1250-1310 Geometrical [[tracery]]. The second stage contains small and narrow single light windows on all but the east side. The third stage lies above the line of the nave, with the achievement of a single window on all sides. Each of these windows are of similar pattern to the bottom stage west window, but smaller, with [[Transom (architectural)|transom]]&mdash;separating horizontal bar&mdash;and with an attached hood mould. The fourth stage windows are elongated versions of the third stage, but with added [[Boss (architecture)|label stops]] at the [[Springer (architecture)|spring]] of the hood mould. The tower sits on a simple moulded [[Socle (architecture)|socle]] (plinth) topped by a cill band&mdash;angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face&mdash;which continues around the whole church apart from the south aisle.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/><ref name=Pastcape/>\n\nThe nave is defined only by the [[clerestory]] above the abutted north and south aisle roofs, and a [[gable]] surmounted by a cross running from the clerestory's [[Coping (architecture)|coped]] [[parapet]] as it meets the east chancel. The clerestory contains vertically segmented clear glazed twin-light windows, four each north and south, all containing panel [[tracery]]&mdash;a Perpendicular style of upright straight openings above lower lights&mdash;within flattened arches with hood moulds with label stops.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nAttached to the nave are the north and south aisles. The early 15th-century north aisle is of [[Course (architecture)#String course|string-coursed]] ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same appearance and style&mdash;rectilinear with inset three lights of simple round head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed door opening with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the roof edge at the base of the parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third [[Buttress#Terminology|diagonal buttress]] at the north-west corner.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe south aisle shows a plain parapet above coursed ironstone with ashlar edgings reflecting the lower stages of the tower. Three three-light windows, one plain glazed to the west of the porch, two [[stained glass|stained]] to the east, are of same style to those of the north aisle, but with added facetted details between the head arches and the frames. The 1858-rebuilt ashlar south porch, which ''Pevsner'' describes as \"imitation Early English\", is entered though a pointed arch moulded opening supported by three columns, with a hood mould with label stops above. The porch roof parapet is coped and runs into the south aisle parapet, and above the doorway opening rises to a shallow pointed gable surmounted by a cross of [[Celtic cross|Celtic]] appearance. On the west and east side are flat headed windows with twin lights, clear glazing, and tracery, and hood moulds with personified label stops. Inside the porch the nave door, with its elaborate hinges and handle surrounds, is set within a pointed arch opening surrounded by a multi-facetted moulded arch supported by columns with floriate [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe chancel with its side chapels&mdash;all c1325-1350 except north chapel early 15th century&mdash;are string-coursed: chancel east wall entirely ashlar; south chapel walls ironstone with east wall ashlar above; and north chapel ashlar with ironstone at its east half below a window cill band that continues onto the east wall of chapel and chancel. The chapel parapets are deep crenelated repeats of the tower battlements. At the east wall the parapets follow the angled roof line of both chapels and meet a plain coped gable at the east chancel wall. Four [[pinnacle]]s define the corners of the chapels and the edge of the chancel gable. The pinnacles, faced with gable and finial devices, are crocketed with [[Grotesque#In architecture|grotesque]]s. Further pinnacles are placed at the west corner and centre of the south chapel. The chancel and north chapel east wall is supported by three-step buttresses&mdash;two defining the edge of the chancel, and one at the north chapel corner which is diagonal. A two-step [[Buttress#Terminology|angled buttress]] supports the south chapel east corner. A further two buttresses support both chapels on the north and south sides.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe central chancel east window is of five lights, separated by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoils&mdash;lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles&mdash;and [[spandrels]]. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] windows, both wider than high. The window to the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is clear glazed. The window to the west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\n===Interior===\nThe church is [[Plaster|rendered]] throughout, with mid-19th-century plain wooden roofs supported by simple [[Timber roof truss#Arch-braced truss|arch-braces]], finished at their spring by carved stone [[corbel]] angels.<ref name=NHLEchurch/>\n\nThe nave contains [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with double [[chamfer]]ed pointed arch [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. The north late 12th-century arcade&mdash;[[Romanesque architecture#Transitional style|Transitional]] (''Cox''); Early English (''Pevsner'')&mdash;of four bays is supported by round late [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] with simple [[frustum]]-style [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s of four facets. The two west bays are separated by a wall, previously the west wall of the nave. The capital of the east pier has an additional line of floriate detailing, reminiscent of crocketing. The south Early English Decorated style early 13th-century arcade of three bays sits on octagonal piers with octagonal capitals with horizontal moulding. All capitals have been recarved.<ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe north aisle of the nave has at its east end, where it meets the north chancel chapel, a multi-facetted moulded arch with rounded half piers and part-octagonal capitals. Underneath the arch is the [[church organ]]. Within the aisle is a c.1888 stained glass window of three lights. On the north wall is an early 19th-century painted [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]], quatrefoil framed, with added note of De Ligne Gregory, rector H. Dodwell, and Thomas Plaskett. The south aisle contains two stained glass windows, one by Cox & Sons, c.1860. At the east end of the aisle is a doorway, Tudor arch headed, and [[Stairs#Spiral and helical stairs|spiral stairs]] to a loft above a previous [[rood screen]], above which is another exit doorway. There is also a double [[aumbry]]. The arched doorway and door from the south porch is at the west bay.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/><ref name=Cox/>\n\nThe double chamfered pointed tower arch springs from double octagonal responds&mdash;half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch&mdash; with octagonal capitals. A 20th-century wooden Perpendicular screen with double doors separates lower part of the tower arch from the nave. The tower interior is unrendered, and within it, at the south-west, is a pointed arch doorway with oak door leading to the upper stages.\n\nThe chancel arch is double-chamfered on both sides with part-octagonal responds and [[Battlement|crenellated]] capitals. At the lower part is a late 19th-century wooden rood screen of Perpendicular style, of three sections&mdash;voided in the centre section and void above with panelling below in the outer, and tracery above in all, the top line with crenellations. The chancel and both side chapels are separated by screens of the same style and date, and include openings to the north and south chapels. Sited at the face of the screens within the chancel, and part of the same design, are choir stalls of mirror repeat. Behind the screens are chapels, north and south, each defined by two Perpendicular chancel bays, the north with heavily moulded arches, the south double-chamfered. The north is set on side responds and central piers of semi-circular facets with hollows between, and part-octagonal capitals. The south is set on half-pier responds on part-octagonal capitals attached to extension of the arch double-chamfer. The chancel [[stained glass]] east window is by [[Ward and Hughes]], c.1970. On either side of the window is a corner [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] with 19th-century figures. Further church stained glass is by [[James Powell and Sons|Powell & Sons]].<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nBoth north and south chapels have canopied niches: the south chapel one each either side of a c.1916 stained glass window; the north, one at the north-east corner. The north chapel also contains a [[piscina]]. In the south chapel at the east wall, in an opening leading from the chapel to the chancel, is a blind doorway. At the south side is a piscina, an aumbry and a [[Holy water font|stoup]]. There is an elaborate canopied relief tomb niche, without tomb, with internal arch, with decorative [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] above, holding a cinquefoil with foliate bosses attached, and [[spandrel]]s containing shields. The south chapel west stained glass window is c.1892. The north chapel has mirrored a more elaborate tomb niche including spandrels containing angels holding shields, and a castellated top with foliate cross.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe church Perpendicular (''Pevsner'') or [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated]] (''Cox'') octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]] is c.1400, although re-cut, and includes a carving of [[Jesus|Christ]] holding a [[chalice]].<ref name=Pevsner/><ref name=Cox/>\n\n''Pevsner'' notes the church holding a chalice, cover and [[paten]] by David Willaume, dated 1711; a [[silver-gilt]] [[Flagon#Christian use|flagon]] by John Ward, dated 1713; a silver-gilt [[alms]]basin by John Ward, dated 1714; a waiter by Daniel Smith & Robert Sharp, dated 1780; and a secular flagon by J.

Below the plaque is an [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] with [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[scrollwork]] decoration, and a centred scroll-edged [[coat of arms]]. The arms contain three white cockerels on blue [[Ordinary (heraldry)|field]] to the left, and three gold lion heads on a black [[Bar (heraldry)|bar]] with five gold bars, on a red field to the right. The memorial is dedicated to Daniel de Ligne (died 12 December 1730) and Cadwallader Glynne (died 1 January 1736), the nephew and heir of Daniel de Ligne. The monument notes that Glynne had [[bequest]]ed a yearly amount of \u00a35 to be distributed to the poor of Harlaxton parish in perpetuity. Further dedications on this plaque are to Anna Maria Glynne (died 28 November 1729), only daughter of Cadwallader Glynne, and Dorothy (died 5 August 1747), wife of Glynne and daughter of Benjamin Burell of Pethall, [[Devon]].

One has an [[ogee]]-arched head with cinquefoil and bosses surmounted by a foliate cross, with square columns either side each topped with a crocketted pinnacle. The second&mdash;in the shape of a tomb face, of white marble and topped with coat of arms, sitting on and set in front of a black marble support&mdash;is dedicated to Daniel Gregory (died 9 June 1819, aged 72), the fourth son of George Gregory of Harlaxton and his wife, Anne. The monument was provided by the deceased's brother George De Ligne Gregory. The third, of similar style, but topped by a knight's helmet and two coat of arms, is dedicated to George De Ligne Gregory (1 May 1740 - 24 August 1822).<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nDedication of the chancel east stained glass window is given on a commemorative brass plaque on the south wall: \"This window was placed by his widow to the memory of John Sherwin Gregory Esqu. of Harlaxton Manor & of Brancote Hills in the county of Notts, High Sheriff for the latter county in 1829, magistrate for the counties of Nottingham & Derby & Deputy Lieutenant for the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham.

The text also notes that a treble bell was added to the peal by Hope's family and parishioners in 1946. Within the tower are two [[lozenge]]-shaped black-framed coat of arms [[funerary hatchment]]s, one at the north, one at the south, each containing the motto \"Resurgam\" (I shall rise again), within a scroll.

The early 15th-century north aisle is of [[Course (architecture)#String course|string-coursed]] ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same appearance and style&mdash;rectilinear with inset three lights of simple round head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed door opening with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the roof edge at the base of the parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third [[Buttress#Terminology|diagonal buttress]] at the north-west corner.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe south aisle shows a plain parapet above coursed ironstone with ashlar edgings reflecting the lower stages of the tower. Three three-light windows, one plain glazed to the west of the porch, two [[stained glass|stained]] to the east, are of same style to those of the north aisle, but with added facetted details between the head arches and the frames. The 1858-rebuilt ashlar south porch, which ''Pevsner'' describes as \"imitation Early English\", is entered though a pointed arch moulded opening supported by three columns, with a hood mould with label stops above. The porch roof parapet is coped and runs into the south aisle parapet, and above the doorway opening rises to a shallow pointed gable surmounted by a cross of [[Celtic cross|Celtic]] appearance. On the west and east side are flat headed windows with twin lights, clear glazing, and tracery, and hood moulds with personified label stops. Inside the porch the nave door, with its elaborate hinges and handle surrounds, is set within a pointed arch opening surrounded by a multi-facetted moulded arch supported by columns with floriate [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe chancel with its side chapels&mdash;all c1325-1350 except north chapel early 15th century&mdash;are string-coursed: chancel east wall entirely ashlar; south chapel walls ironstone with east wall ashlar above; and north chapel ashlar with ironstone at its east half below a window cill band that continues onto the east wall of chapel and chancel. The chapel parapets are deep crenelated repeats of the tower battlements. At the east wall the parapets follow the angled roof line of both chapels and meet a plain coped gable at the east chancel wall. Four [[pinnacle]]s define the corners of the chapels and the edge of the chancel gable. The pinnacles, faced with gable and finial devices, are crocketed with [[Grotesque#In architecture|grotesque]]s. Further pinnacles are placed at the west corner and centre of the south chapel. The chancel and north chapel east wall is supported by three-step buttresses&mdash;two defining the edge of the chancel, and one at the north chapel corner which is diagonal. A two-step [[Buttress#Terminology|angled buttress]] supports the south chapel east corner. A further two buttresses support both chapels on the north and south sides.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe central chancel east window is of five lights, separated by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoils&mdash;lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles&mdash;and [[spandrels]]. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] windows, both wider than high. The window to the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is clear glazed. The window to the west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\n===Interior===\nThe church is [[Plaster|rendered]] throughout, with mid-19th-century plain wooden roofs supported by simple [[Timber roof truss#Arch-braced truss|arch-braces]], finished at their spring by carved stone [[corbel]] angels.<ref name=NHLEchurch/>\n\nThe nave contains [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with double [[chamfer]]ed pointed arch [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. The north late 12th-century arcade&mdash;[[Romanesque architecture#Transitional style|Transitional]] (''Cox''); Early English (''Pevsner'')&mdash;of four bays is supported by round late [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] with simple [[frustum]]-style [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s of four facets. The two west bays are separated by a wall, previously the west wall of the nave. The capital of the east pier has an additional line of floriate detailing, reminiscent of crocketing. The south Early English Decorated style early 13th-century arcade of three bays sits on octagonal piers with octagonal capitals with horizontal moulding. All capitals have been recarved.<ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe north aisle of the nave has at its east end, where it meets the north chancel chapel, a multi-facetted moulded arch with rounded half piers and part-octagonal capitals. Underneath the arch is the [[church organ]]. Within the aisle is a c.1888 stained glass window of three lights. On the north wall is an early 19th-century painted [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]], quatrefoil framed, with added note of De Ligne Gregory, rector H. Dodwell, and Thomas Plaskett. The south aisle contains two stained glass windows, one by Cox & Sons, c.1860. At the east end of the aisle is a doorway, Tudor arch headed, and [[Stairs#Spiral and helical stairs|spiral stairs]] to a loft above a previous [[rood screen]], above which is another exit doorway. There is also a double [[aumbry]]. The arched doorway and door from the south porch is at the west bay.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/><ref name=Cox/>\n\nThe double chamfered pointed tower arch springs from double octagonal responds&mdash;half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch&mdash; with octagonal capitals. A 20th-century wooden Perpendicular screen with double doors separates lower part of the tower arch from the nave. The tower interior is unrendered, and within it, at the south-west, is a pointed arch doorway with oak door leading to the upper stages.\n\nThe chancel arch is double-chamfered on both sides with part-octagonal responds and [[Battlement|crenellated]] capitals. At the lower part is a late 19th-century wooden rood screen of Perpendicular style, of three sections&mdash;voided in the centre section and void above with panelling below in the outer, and tracery above in all, the top line with crenellations. The chancel and both side chapels are separated by screens of the same style and date, and include openings to the north and south chapels. Sited at the face of the screens within the chancel, and part of the same design, are choir stalls of mirror repeat. Behind the screens are chapels, north and south, each defined by two Perpendicular chancel bays, the north with heavily moulded arches, the south double-chamfered. The north is set on side responds and central piers of semi-circular facets with hollows between, and part-octagonal capitals. The south is set on half-pier responds on part-octagonal capitals attached to extension of the arch double-chamfer. The chancel [[stained glass]] east window is by [[Ward and Hughes]], c.1970. On either side of the window is a corner [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] with 19th-century figures. Further church stained glass is by [[James Powell and Sons|Powell & Sons]].<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nBoth north and south chapels have canopied niches: the south chapel one each either side of a c.1916 stained glass window; the north, one at the north-east corner. The north chapel also contains a [[piscina]]. In the south chapel at the east wall, in an opening leading from the chapel to the chancel, is a blind doorway. At the south side is a piscina, an aumbry and a [[Holy water font|stoup]]. There is an elaborate canopied relief tomb niche, without tomb, with internal arch, with decorative [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] above, holding a cinquefoil with foliate bosses attached, and [[spandrel]]s containing shields. The south chapel west stained glass window is c.1892. The north chapel has mirrored a more elaborate tomb niche including spandrels containing angels holding shields, and a castellated top with foliate cross.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/>\n\nThe church Perpendicular (''Pevsner'') or [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated]] (''Cox'') octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]] is c.1400, although re-cut, and includes a carving of [[Jesus|Christ]] holding a [[chalice]].<ref name=Pevsner/><ref name=Cox/>\n\n''Pevsner'' notes the church holding a chalice, cover and [[paten]] by David Willaume, dated 1711; a [[silver-gilt]] [[Flagon#Christian use|flagon]] by John Ward, dated 1713; a silver-gilt [[alms]]basin by John Ward, dated 1714; a waiter by Daniel Smith & Robert Sharp, dated 1780; and a secular flagon by J. Denzilow, dated 1781.<ref name=Pevsner/>\n\n==Memorials==\nWithin the north chapel, beneath the canopied [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] on the north wall is an early 15th-century tomb memorial with two recumbent [[alabaster]] figures, attributed to Sir Richard Rickhill and his wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Pevsner/> ''Cox'' attributes the tomb differently, to [[William Rickhill (judge)|William Rickhill]], [[Justice of the Common Pleas]], and his wife Elizabeth, c.1410.<ref name=Cox/> Also in the north chapel is a [[English church monuments#Medieval period|table tomb]] with inlaid black marble panels, and a black marble lid with the inscription: \"Sir Daniel De Ligne died the 20th day of March 1686 [and] The Lady Elizabeth his wife died the 25th of Aprill 1682\", and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic shield]] above.<ref name=NHLEchurch/><ref name=Cox/> The [[Flemish people|Flemish]] De Ligne family purchased the [[manor]] of Harlaxton in the 17th century.<ref name=Cox/>\n\nA marble wall memorial on the north chapel north wall, erected 1742, comprises an engraved [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]], this below an [[entablature]] with floriate details topped by a [[Rooster|cockerel]]. Below the entablature, and either side, hangs gathered drapes. Below the plaque is an [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] with [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[scrollwork]] decoration, and a centred scroll-edged [[coat of arms]]. The arms contain three white cockerels on blue [[Ordinary (heraldry)|field]] to the left, and three gold lion heads on a black [[Bar (heraldry)|bar]] with five gold bars, on a red field to the right. The memorial is dedicated to Daniel de Ligne (died 12 December 1730) and Cadwallader Glynne (died 1 January 1736), the nephew and heir of Daniel de Ligne. The monument notes that Glynne had [[bequest]]ed a yearly amount of \u00a35 to be distributed to the poor of Harlaxton parish in perpetuity. Further dedications on this plaque are to Anna Maria Glynne (died 28 November 1729), only daughter of Cadwallader Glynne, and Dorothy (died 5 August 1747), wife of Glynne and daughter of Benjamin Burell of Pethall, [[Devon]]. A further marble wall memorial in north chapel, comprising plaque with draped urn above and apron below, is to George Gregory (died 1758), and his wife Ann (died 1785), erected by their four sons&mdash;Ann had inherited the estates of Daniel De Ligne after the death of Cadwallader Glynne.<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nIn the south chapel there is a commemorative brass plaque to William Strood and his wife Agnes, both of whom died in 1448.<ref name=Cox/> Also are three marble tablets to the Gregory family. One has an [[ogee]]-arched head with cinquefoil and bosses surmounted by a foliate cross, with square columns either side each topped with a crocketted pinnacle. The second&mdash;in the shape of a tomb face, of white marble and topped with coat of arms, sitting on and set in front of a black marble support&mdash;is dedicated to Daniel Gregory (died 9 June 1819, aged 72), the fourth son of George Gregory of Harlaxton and his wife, Anne. The monument was provided by the deceased's brother George De Ligne Gregory. The third, of similar style, but topped by a knight's helmet and two coat of arms, is dedicated to George De Ligne Gregory (1 May 1740 - 24 August 1822).<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nDedication of the chancel east stained glass window is given on a commemorative brass plaque on the south wall: \"This window was placed by his widow to the memory of John Sherwin Gregory Esqu. of Harlaxton Manor & of Brancote Hills in the county of Notts, High Sheriff for the latter county in 1829, magistrate for the counties of Nottingham & Derby & Deputy Lieutenant for the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham. Married Catherine, 3rd daughter of Robert Holden Esqu.of Nutthall Temple, Notts & died June 7th 1869 aged 85 & was buried at Bramcote. Deeply and deservedly lamented by his numerous friends and relatives.\" A handed brass plaque on the north wall is \"In memory of William Henry Simcox. Rector of this parish, who entered into rest May 4th 1889, aged 46.\"<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nThe north aisle east stained glass window is dedicated, by brass plaque, to a Henry Hemsley (died 24 February 1888), and was erected by his neighbours and parishioners. To the left, between this and the aisle central window, is a memorial with pointed head and apron below, containing two round-headed panels with scrolling and shell device above. The left panel shows a dedication to \"Arabella wife of Edward Saul, Clerk, a vertuous woman lovely in her life and lamented in her death. April 16, 1726, in the 36 year of her age. Leaving issue two daughters.\" Below is \"Beaumont Saul, the younger, after a languishing sickness, supported with piety and meekness, resigned her soul to God, June 26, 1736 in the 21 year of her age\" and \"Cassandra Beaumont a primitive christian widow. Full of good works and alms deeds, near to the bodys of her much loved and lamented daughter and grand daughter, directed her own to be interred Sept. 27 1742, the 91 year of her age.\" The right panel shows, at the top, a dedication to \"Arabella the elder daughter marryd to Rich. Herring of Newark in the county of Nottingham, Gent.\" Further down is that to \"Edward Saul A. M. Prependary of Lincoln and from the year 1705, rector of this parish; to the memory of his wife and family, deserving all marks of respect and affection from him erected this monument 1744. and died September the 12th 1753, aged 77\".<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nA chancel floor [[slate]] grave slab is to Joseph Cane (1761), son of Robert Cane (rector) and his wife, Elizabeth, \"prematurely snatched away\" in less than a month through a convulsive cough. A further chancel stone floor slab, now badly worn, is noted by ''Turnor'' to be to the memory of James Morrison, cleric (died 1705, aged 33), and set by his \"grieving widow\", Eleanor. A nave floor slab is that to Arabella (died 25 May 1740, aged 1 year 3 months), and Richard (died 30 March 1741, aged 1 year 1 month), the children of Beaumont and Mary Leeson. Mary Leeson (died 21 May 1770, aged 53 years), the widow of \"Beaumont Leeson of Sutterton\" and the mother of Arabella and Richard, is also commemorated on the same slab.<ref name=Turnor/>\n\nOn the tower arch is a framed memorial to Alban Sackett Hope, rector from 1920 to 1943. The text also notes that a treble bell was added to the peal by Hope's family and parishioners in 1946. Within the tower are two [[lozenge]]-shaped black-framed coat of arms [[funerary hatchment]]s, one at the north, one at the south, each containing the motto \"Resurgam\" (I shall rise again), within a scroll. Also within the tower is a framed text originally sited over the arch of the belfry:<ref name=Turnor/><blockquote>Benefactors to the parish of Harlaxton 1632.

It was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]] and [[Jawed Karim]] in February 2005, and the first video was \"[[Me at the zoo]]\" uploaded by Karim on his channel in April 2005.

It is also the only Catholic day and boarding college for boys in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. Students at St Bede's are colloquially known as Bedeans. St Bede's College was founded in 1911 by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]], a [[religious congregation]] founded in [[Lyon]], France in 1816.\n\nThe current rector of the college, Mr Justin Boyle, was appointed in 2002. He was previously the first lay principal of [[St. Kevin's College, Oamaru]] but left at the end of 2001 to become the first lay rector of St Bede's.\n\n==St. Bede==\nThe college bears the name of [[The Venerable Bede]] (AD 673\u2013735) an English [[Benedictine]] Monk, Scholar, and Saint. Widely regarded as the Father of English History, Bede is most famous for his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', recognized as the first ecclesiastical history of Britain. During his time, Bede was regarded as the finest scholar in Europe. His shrine is at [[Jarrow]], [[England]].\n\n==Philosophy and Marist Tradition==\nThe college is renowned for its high academic standards, proud sporting heritage and the distinctive educational philosophy of the Marist tradition. From its beginnings, St. Bede's College has taught its students by observing a tradition that combines Marian and apostolic elements. For the most part of the previous century, the college had residential Marist priests and brothers as teaching staff. There is still a significant Marist presence at the college.\n\nThe college's mission is '''To help each boy develop fully by Faith and by Works'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] is a religious congregation founded in 1816 in [[Lyon]], [[France]] at the time of the [[French Revolution]] by  Father [[Jean-Claude Colin]] (1790\u20131875) and twelve colleagues, including [[Marcellin Champagnat|Marcellin Joseph Beno\u00eet Champagnat]], future Founder of the [[Marist Brothers]], and Father (later Bishop) [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pompallier]], first bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand.\n\nThe canonical approbation of the Society of Mary was given by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1836. Fr Jean-Claude Colin had a close association with Pompallier who accompanied the French Marist Missionaries to New Zealand. The Society of Mary became involved in missionary work and teaching, work that was very similar to the missions of the [[Jesuits]], but which had a distinctive Marian approach.\n\nBefore 1877, education in New Zealand was a provincial jurisdiction, with many schools being established by churches or private funding. With the [[Education Act 1877]], the New Zealand Government centralised control through twelve regional education boards to introduce free, compulsory and secular education. Schools intending to teach religious instruction could not receive Government assistance. The Society of Mary continued to build the foundations for a Catholic System of Education, sourcing religious teachers from Ireland, Europe and Australia. In 1885, the Society of Mary established St. Patrick's College in Cambridge Terrace, Wellington. St. Patrick's College was the first Society of Mary secondary school for Boys in [[New Zealand]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSt. Bede's College, Christchurch, was established in 1911 at the request of [[John Grimes (New Zealand bishop)|Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M.]], and the first Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. The Society owned St. Bede's College. The school was originally located along Ferry Road, but it outgrew its facilities. The college had the option of purchasing the current site or that of [[St. Andrew's College (New Zealand)|St. Andrew's College, Christchurch]] in [[Merivale]]. Some say that the choice made was a fine decision because due to the land being cheaper, the college was able to build magnificent stone buildings to accommodate the monks and to accommodate lessons. The chapel was originally used as a gym, but with the building of Chanel Hall, it became obsolete and so was converted to a chapel. The chapel contains the Board of Honour, honouring Bedeans who fought and died for their country in both world wars. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe college was moved in 1920 to its present site on 220,000 square meters of fields and trees at the northern entrance to the city. The original buildings of St. Bede's were magnificent in old design, but  most of them had to be demolished in 1981 due to new earthquake safety requirements. However, the chapel and half of Durham remain standing. Over the years, buildings have continued to be added to the college, including the Alistair Macdonald Centre for the Performing Arts, Jarrow (a senior boarding dorm) as well as a new gymnasium. The chapel is described as the heart of the school. In addition to the surface buildings, the school has a number of tunnels and bomb shelters under the school, built for evacuation purposes. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Society of Mary]] in [[New Zealand]] accepted a complaint that one of its priests, a former teacher at St Bede's College (in 1939), [[Francis Durning]], had sexually abused children.<ref name=\"no records\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|title=Wellington Catholic school has no records of sex abuse|date=11 November 2018|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128082612/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==The house system==\nA house system was instituted at St. Bede's College, with every student allocated to a house. The house system has several functions, including administrative. Each house is named for a distinguished person associated with the college and its name. There are five houses. These are:\n* '''Benedict''', gold house, named for St. Benedict, Founder of the Benedictine Order at Monte Cassino of which Bede was a member. Benedict has won the house points shield (Burger Shield) from 2003\u20132011. Renowned for the motto, \"pure gold\".\n* '''Colin''', light blue house, named for The Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, S.M. was a French priest, founder of the Society of Mary in Lyon, France.\n* '''McCarthy''', green house, named for Major, Rt. Hon. Sir Thaddeus McCarthy, Alumnus, Jurist and the college's first Knight.\n* '''Mannix''', dark blue house, named for Fr. John Mannix, SM, Seventh Rector of the college and first Old Boy to become Rector.\n* '''Redwood''', maroon house (often uses Red), named for Francis M. Redwood, SM, Archbishop of Wellington, who successfully sourced teaching [[religious institute]]s from France, Ireland, and Australia, after the passage of the Education Act, 1877. He also served on the Senate of the University of New Zealand for more than 25 years.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThe boarding houses are for boarding pupils and are located on the college grounds. These are:\n* '''Grimes''', named for John Joseph Grimes, SM, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (1888). Bishop Grimes oversaw the completion of construction in 1905 of the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], designed by [[Francis Petre]]. The Grimes building sustained damage in the Canterbury earthquake, and was therefore demolished.\n* '''Jarrow''', named for the English town of Jarrow, on the River Tyne, and the Monastery where St. Bede spent most of his life.\n* '''Durham''', named for Durham Cathedral, England, where the remains of St. Bede were entombed after being taken from Jarrow circa 1020.\n* '''Wearmouth''', The Wearmouth boarding wing for Year 13 boarders was opened during the first week in August 2010.

It is also the only Catholic day and boarding college for boys in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. Students at St Bede's are colloquially known as Bedeans. St Bede's College was founded in 1911 by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]], a [[religious congregation]] founded in [[Lyon]], France in 1816.\n\nThe current rector of the college, Mr Justin Boyle, was appointed in 2002. He was previously the first lay principal of [[St. Kevin's College, Oamaru]] but left at the end of 2001 to become the first lay rector of St Bede's.\n\n==St. Bede==\nThe college bears the name of [[The Venerable Bede]] (AD 673\u2013735) an English [[Benedictine]] Monk, Scholar, and Saint. Widely regarded as the Father of English History, Bede is most famous for his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', recognized as the first ecclesiastical history of Britain. During his time, Bede was regarded as the finest scholar in Europe. His shrine is at [[Jarrow]], [[England]].\n\n==Philosophy and Marist Tradition==\nThe college is renowned for its high academic standards, proud sporting heritage and the distinctive educational philosophy of the Marist tradition. From its beginnings, St. Bede's College has taught its students by observing a tradition that combines Marian and apostolic elements. For the most part of the previous century, the college had residential Marist priests and brothers as teaching staff. There is still a significant Marist presence at the college.\n\nThe college's mission is '''To help each boy develop fully by Faith and by Works'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] is a religious congregation founded in 1816 in [[Lyon]], [[France]] at the time of the [[French Revolution]] by  Father [[Jean-Claude Colin]] (1790\u20131875) and twelve colleagues, including [[Marcellin Champagnat|Marcellin Joseph Beno\u00eet Champagnat]], future Founder of the [[Marist Brothers]], and Father (later Bishop) [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pompallier]], first bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand.\n\nThe canonical approbation of the Society of Mary was given by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1836. Fr Jean-Claude Colin had a close association with Pompallier who accompanied the French Marist Missionaries to New Zealand. The Society of Mary became involved in missionary work and teaching, work that was very similar to the missions of the [[Jesuits]], but which had a distinctive Marian approach.\n\nBefore 1877, education in New Zealand was a provincial jurisdiction, with many schools being established by churches or private funding. With the [[Education Act 1877]], the New Zealand Government centralised control through twelve regional education boards to introduce free, compulsory and secular education. Schools intending to teach religious instruction could not receive Government assistance. The Society of Mary continued to build the foundations for a Catholic System of Education, sourcing religious teachers from Ireland, Europe and Australia. In 1885, the Society of Mary established St. Patrick's College in Cambridge Terrace, Wellington. St. Patrick's College was the first Society of Mary secondary school for Boys in [[New Zealand]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSt. Bede's College, Christchurch, was established in 1911 at the request of [[John Grimes (New Zealand bishop)|Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M.]], and the first Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. The Society owned St. Bede's College. The school was originally located along Ferry Road, but it outgrew its facilities. The college had the option of purchasing the current site or that of [[St. Andrew's College (New Zealand)|St. Andrew's College, Christchurch]] in [[Merivale]]. Some say that the choice made was a fine decision because due to the land being cheaper, the college was able to build magnificent stone buildings to accommodate the monks and to accommodate lessons. The chapel was originally used as a gym, but with the building of Chanel Hall, it became obsolete and so was converted to a chapel. The chapel contains the Board of Honour, honouring Bedeans who fought and died for their country in both world wars. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe college was moved in 1920 to its present site on 220,000 square meters of fields and trees at the northern entrance to the city. The original buildings of St. Bede's were magnificent in old design, but  most of them had to be demolished in 1981 due to new earthquake safety requirements. However, the chapel and half of Durham remain standing. Over the years, buildings have continued to be added to the college, including the Alistair Macdonald Centre for the Performing Arts, Jarrow (a senior boarding dorm) as well as a new gymnasium. The chapel is described as the heart of the school. In addition to the surface buildings, the school has a number of tunnels and bomb shelters under the school, built for evacuation purposes. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==The house system==\nA house system was instituted at St. Bede's College, with every student allocated to a house. The house system has several functions, including administrative. Each house is named for a distinguished person associated with the college and its name. There are five houses. These are:\n* '''Benedict''', gold house, named for St. Benedict, Founder of the Benedictine Order at Monte Cassino of which Bede was a member. Benedict has won the house points shield (Burger Shield) from 2003\u20132011. Renowned for the motto, \"pure gold\".\n* '''Colin''', light blue house, named for The Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, S.M. was a French priest, founder of the Society of Mary in Lyon, France.\n* '''McCarthy''', green house, named for Major, Rt. Hon. Sir Thaddeus McCarthy, Alumnus, Jurist and the college's first Knight.\n* '''Mannix''', dark blue house, named for Fr. John Mannix, SM, Seventh Rector of the college and first Old Boy to become Rector.\n* '''Redwood''', maroon house (often uses Red), named for Francis M. Redwood, SM, Archbishop of Wellington, who successfully sourced teaching [[religious institute]]s from France, Ireland, and Australia, after the passage of the Education Act, 1877. He also served on the Senate of the University of New Zealand for more than 25 years.\n\n==Boarding houses==\nThe boarding houses are for boarding pupils and are located on the college grounds. These are:\n* '''Grimes''', named for John Joseph Grimes, SM, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (1888). Bishop Grimes oversaw the completion of construction in 1905 of the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], designed by [[Francis Petre]]. The Grimes building sustained damage in the Canterbury earthquake, and was therefore demolished.\n* '''Jarrow''', named for the English town of Jarrow, on the River Tyne, and the Monastery where St. Bede spent most of his life.\n* '''Durham''', named for Durham Cathedral, England, where the remains of St. Bede were entombed after being taken from Jarrow circa 1020.\n* '''Wearmouth''', The Wearmouth boarding wing for Year 13 boarders was opened during the first week in August 2010. This wonderful facility was designed by architect Duval O\u2019Neill and built by Matthew Bushnell.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|People educated at St Bede's College, Christchurch}}\nSt. Bede's College Old Boys are notably represented in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Firstly, it is the name of the [[Kodava language]] and culture followed by a number of communities from [[Kodagu]]. Secondly, within the Kodava - speaking communities and region ([[Kodagu district|Kodagu]]) it describes the dominant Kodava people. The Kodavas ([[Kodava language|Kodava]], anglicised as Coorgs), are considered a patrilineal ethno-lingual tribe from the region of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]], (in [[Karnataka]] state of southern India), who natively speak the [[Kodava language]]. Traditionally they are land-owning agriculturists with martial customs. They practice family [[exogamy]] and caste [[endogamy]].

Forbes Watson (from NY public library)]]\nThe words ''Kodava'' (the indigenous people, language and culture) and ''Kodagu'' (the land) come from the same root word 'Koda' of unknown meaning. Some claim it means 'hills', others say it means 'west' but both relate to the Western Ghats' location. Kodagu is called ''Kodava Naad'' in the native [[Kodava language]]. The community members were called Kodava by the other natives and Coorgs by the British. They are ethnically and culturally distinct people. For centuries, the Kodavas have lived in Kodagu cultivating paddy fields, maintaining cattle herds and carrying arms during war.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Indigenous origin===\nThere are a variety of theories as to the origin of the Kodava, including theories of them being either the indigenous inhabitants of their region, or of foreign origins before two thousand years ago. However the foreign theories are mere speculations because they have found no concrete evidences.\n*As per the indigenous theory, Kodavas are the native inhabitants of Kodagu who learnt and practiced agriculture. Hence they were an ancient warlike tribe which got civilised over the centuries and gained prosperity.\n*Kodavas (Coorgs) may be the descendants of the [[Cephalic index#Cephalic index in human anthropology|broad headed]] (''brachycephalic'') stock who entered into the Indus Valley during the Mohenjodaro period before the Indo-Aryans and later migrated to the Coorg region (Hutton, as quoted by Balakrishnan in 1976).\n\n===Other origin speculations===\n* One view is that the Kodavas are descendants of [[Scythians]] (Connor 1870, Rice 1878). According to yet another but similar view, the Kodavas belong to the [[Indo-Scythian]] race like the [[Sakas]], the [[Western Satraps|Western Kshatrapas]] and the Thiyyar.\n\n===Consensus===\n* Kannada inscriptions speak of this region as being called ''Kudagu nad'' (parts of Kodagu, Western Mysore and Kerala) as well. Both the name of the natives and of the region are synonymous (Kodava-Kodavu; Kodaga-Kodagu; Coorgs-Coorg).<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\">{{cite book|last=Kamath|first=Dr. S. U.|title=Karnataka State Gazetteer: Kodagu District|year=1993|publisher=Government Press|location=Bangalore|page=160}}</ref>\n* In 1398 AD, when Vijaynagar ruled South India, Mangaraja, a Kannada poet, wrote in his lexicon about the Kodavas saying that they were a warrior people who were fond of hunting game for sport.<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\"/>\n\nHistorians agree that the Kodavas have lived in [[Kodagu]] for over a thousand years, hence they are the earliest agriculturists and probably the oldest settled inhabitants of the area.<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\"/><ref name=\"ETHNOLINGUISTIC STUDY\"/><ref name =\"Bowring Eastern Experience\">{{cite book|last=Bowring|first=L|title=Eastern Experiences|url=https://archive.org/details/easternexperien02bowrgoog|year=1872|publisher=Henry S.

Kodagu (then called Coorg) is in dark green.]]\n\n===Puranic association===\nThe Hindu Puranas (Kaveri [[Purana]] of Skanda Purana) claim that Chandra Varma, a [[Chandravanshi]] [[Kshatriya]] (lunar dynasty warrior) and son of Emperor of Matsya Desha, was the ancestor of this 'fierce' race, the Kodavas. An ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalakshmi, he had gone on pilgrimage to several holy places all over India. Chandra Varma had a privy army who escorted him on his campaigns until he came into Kodagu(Coorg). Coorg, the source of the River Kaveri, was uninhabited jungle land when he arrived to settle here. Thereafter he became the first Raja of the Coorg principality. He had 11 sons, the eldest among them was Devakantha who later succeeded him as Raja. They were married to the daughters of the Raja of Vidarbha. These sons and their descendants cultivated and populated the land of Kodagu, they came to be called the Kodava race.<ref>Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870){{Where|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rajas===\n{{See also|Haleri Kingdom}}\n\nThe [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] ruled North Karnataka along with Goa and parts of Maharashtra while the [[Gangas]] ruled South Karnataka and parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu prior to 1000AD. The regions of Hassan, Kodagu (Coorg), Tulunad and Waynad were ruled between them. Later the cholas entered Karnataka to rule, but it was short lived. The [[Hoysala]]s succeeded them and ruled Southern Karnataka (including Tulunad and Coorg) and parts of Tamil Nadu. In the aftermath of the Delhi Sultanate invasion of South India (around 1319) the [[Vijaynagara]] Hindu Empire arose to rule South India until their downfall in the 16th century. From around 1600 until 1834 the [[Haleri Kingdom|Haleri Rajas]] ruled over Coorg.\n\nSamadhis were built for army chief Biddanda Bopu, who was the commander-in-chief for the army of Dodda Vira Rajendra, and his son Biddanda Somaiah.

The coconut, jackfruit, plantain, mango and other fruits and vegetables were widely used. Ghee was used in well-to-do families and on festive occasions. Rice in the form of Kanji or Koolu was served at meals along with curries and other additional dishes. Non-vegetarian food was not objectionable and alcoholic drinks as a rule weren't prohibited. Pork, chicken, river fish, were commonly consumed as also were varieties of game meat. Pork is a common dish at many households and the famous kodava 'Pandi Curry' is served along with 'Kadumbuttu' (steamed rice balls) which is almost deep Brown in color due to the use of garcinia cambogia vinegar called Kachumpuli. Sweet dishes like akki payasa were prepared during festive occasions. Other special dishes included otti (rice roti), paaputtu (similar to [[idli]]), [[Idiyappam|noolputtu]] (rice noodles), thambuttu (a sweet), etc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Organizational structure===\nKodava settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional [[Ainmanes|Ainmane]] houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape.  The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants and non-Kodavas. .<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Festivals==\n\nKodava festivities center around their agriculture and military tradition. Originally most of their lives were spent in the field: cultivating, harvesting and guarding their fields from the depredations of wild animals, or otherwise they were either waging war or hunting for game. Their new year was originally celebrated on Bishu Changrandi (called [[Vishu]] in Kerala and  [[Chithirai Thirunal]] in Tamil Nadu). The Kodavas began to celebrate a few Hindu festivals such as [[Ugadi]], [[Ayudha Puja]] (Dasara, also called Navratri, Vijaydashami, Durga Puja or Dussehra) and [[Mahashivaratri]] under the Haleri Rajas(1602\u20131834). However Kodavas traditionally celebrate the following three main festivals peculiar to Kodagu alone (two are cultural and one religious):\n\n===Kailpoldu (Festival of Arms)===\nKailpoldu is celebrated on 3 September. Officially, the festival begins on the 18th day after the sun enters the Simha Raasi (the Western sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]). Kail means weapon or armoury and Pold means festival. The day signifies the completion of \"nati\"&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the transplantation of the rice (paddy) crop. The festival signifies the day when men should prepare to guard their crop from wild boars and other animals, since during the preceding months, in which the family were engaged in the fields, all weapons were normally deposited in the \"Kanni Kombare\", or the prayer room. Hence on the day of Kailpoldu, the weapons are taken out of the Pooja room, cleaned and decorated with flowers. They are then kept in the \"Nellakki Nadubade\", the central hall of the house and the place of community worship. Each member of the family has a bath, after which they worship the weapons. Feasting and drinking follow. The eldest member of the family hands a gun to the senior member of the family, signifying the commencement of the festivities. The Menu for the day is Kadumbutte (Rice balls) and Pandhi Curry (Pork Curry) and Alcoholic beverages are also served. The whole family assembles in the \"Mand\" (open ground), where physical contests and sports, including marksmanship, are conducted. In the past the hunting and cooking of wild game was part of the celebration, but today shooting skills are tested by firing at a coconut tied onto the branch of a tall tree. Traditional rural sports, like grabbing a coconut from the hands of a group of 8\u201310 people (thenge porata), throwing a stone the size of a cricket ball at a coconut from a distance of 10\u201315 paces (thenge eed), lifting a stone ball of 30\u201340&nbsp;cm lying at one's feet and throwing it backwards over the shoulders, etc., are now conducted in community groups called Kodava Samajas in towns and cities.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Kaveri Sankramana (worship of river Kaveri)===\n[[File:1632 px - Talakaveri India.JPG|thumb|right|[[Talakaveri]], origin of the river Kaveri]]\nThe Kaveri Sankramana festival normally takes place in mid-October. It is associated with the river [[Kaveri]], which flows through the district from its source at [[Talakaveri]].At a predetermined time, when the sun enters Tula Rasi (Tula sankramana), a fountain from a small tank fills the larger holy tank at Talakaveri. Thousands of people gather to dip in this holy water. The water is collected in bottles and reaches every home throughout Kodagu. This holy water is called Theertha, and is preserved in all Kodava homes. A spoonful of this water is fed to the dying, in the belief that they will attain ''[[moksha]]'' (spiritual emancipation) and gain entry to heaven. On this day, married women wearing new silk saris perform ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' to a vegetable, symbolising the goddess Kaveri. The vegetable is usually a cucumber or a coconut, wrapped in a piece of red silk cloth and decorated with flowers and jewels (mainly 'Pathak' (Kodava Mangalasuthra)). This is called the Kanni Puje. The word Kanni denotes the goddess [[Parvati]], who incarnated as Kaveri. Three sets of [[betel]] leaves and [[areca]] nut are kept in front of the goddess with bunches of glass bangles. All the members of the family pray to the goddess by throwing rice and prostrating themselves before the image. The elder members of the family ceremonially bless the younger. An older married woman then draws water from the well and starts cooking. The menu of the day is dosa and vegetable curry (usually pumpkin curry (kumbala kari) ) and payasa. Nothing but vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and this is the only festival which is strictly vegetarian. Alcohol is prohibited. The Kaveri cult has its center and origin in Kodagu. It is only those Kodava rites associated with the river Kaveri that are Brahmanical in influence.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Puttari (Harvest festival)===\nPuttari means \"new rice\" and is the rice harvest festival (also called Huttari in Kannada). This takes place in late November or early December. Celebrations and preparations for this festival start a week in advance. On the day of Puttari, the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, kadambutt  pandhi curi and also a special food of yam and jaggery water which is eaten before going to the field. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of \"Poli Poli Deva\" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal. Dinner normally consists of meat dishes, such as pork, and mutton curry. Alcoholic beverages are also served at such feasts in Coorg.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Bhagmandala2.JPG|thumb|Bhagamandala temple]]\n[[File:Tank at Talakaveri.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===Shrines and deities===\nThe Kodavas have a local trinity comprising the ''Kuladevi'' (patron goddess) [[Kaveri]], ''Maguru'' (chief preceptor) [[Igguthappa]] and ''Guru Karana'' (revered common ancestor). The Kodavas of Kodagu are polytheist Hindus who believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements and their ancestors. Their chief deities are Bhagwathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Mahadeva  ([[Shiva]]),  [[Bhadrakali]] (a form of Parvati as Kali), Muthappa and Aiyappa.\n\nIgguthappa, the most important local God, is an incarnation of Lord Subramani, the God of snakes, rain, harvest and rice (Incidentally, the famous Kukke Subramani temple located near Kodagu is dedicated to snakes, hence Subramani is the God of snakes despite the misconception that his carrier, the peacock, which eats grains and insects, is wrongly believed to kill and eat snakes). The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. This is similar to the bhuta aradhana of Tulunad. There are many spirits worshipped in Kodagu. The Kodavas also practised snake worship. Consumption of soma (liquor) and pork is permitted,\n\nThey maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting and cutting trees was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. However these days the government and private speculative land buyers have acquired these sacred groves and converted them into farms for monetary gains and with disrespect towards native religious feelings. The Kodavas believe in astrology as well. Generally they don't follow idol worship but believe in nature worship.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\" /> \n[[File:The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri.jpg|left|thumb|The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri, the town is in the background]]\n\nOn their ancestral clan lands they have a shrine (Kaimada), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana - Karana). The spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> Every year, members of each family get together to remember the 'Karana's of their family.\n\nEach village had a Bhagwathi, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an [[Ayyappa|Aiyappa]]. The Kodavas worshipped Mahadeva as well. Some of the main shrines of the Kodavas are the temples of Talakaveri, Bhagamandala, Padi Igguthappa, Peggala (Heggala), Kakot Parambu and Bythoor. The Kodavas also revere and visit the shrines of Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala Manjunatha in Tulunad.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Socio-religious link with North Malabar===\n[[File:Bali theyyam, Payyannur.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Theiray (Theyyam)]]\nThe word Kodakar was the Malayalam word for a Kodava, and it comes from the word \"Kodag-kara\". The ancient Kodavas of Kodagu had land trade with Northern Malabar, especially with [[Thalassery]] (Tellicherry) port on the coast, and would also go on regular pilgrimage to the temples of the region. Devotees from Kodagu were, and still are, frequent visitors to the temples of Kannur and Waynad (districts of North Kerala). These temples are in places like Baithur or Bythoor (Vayathur and [[Ulikkal]]), [[Payyavoor]], Parassinikkadavu, Thirunelli, Kanjirath, Nileshwar and Payyanur. Also the Nambima (Namboothiri) priests of North Malabar traditionally served as the temple priests in the temples of Kodagu. The folk songs of the Kodavas speak of the temple deities having originated in North Malabar. These folk songs while talking of Kodagu and its people also mention the temple regions as well as the [[Thiyya]], Nambiya (Nambiar), the Nambima (Namboothiri) and the Nayamma (the Kodava word for Nair - in Malayalam Nayanmmar means Nairs) people of Northern Malabar.\n\nBaithurappa (Bythoorappa) is a chief deity of the Kodavas. The Puggera family of Kodavas were hereditary temple managers at the Bythoor (Vayathur, in Kerala and near Karnataka's Kodagu border) temple which was in the dominion of the Kalliat Nambiar, who like the Kolathiri (Chera Raja) was an ally of the Kodavas. Every year Kodavas from Southern Kodagu pilgrimage to this place. Likewise the Bovverianda and the Mundiolanda families of Kodavas were the hereditary temple managers at the Payyavur temple which was under the Kolathiri (Chera) kings. This is because a few of the Kodavas lived in North Malabar in the [[Taliparamba]] (ancient capital of the Cheras) region in the ancient past and fought on their side as mercenary soldiers.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n[[File:Dungeon dwelling of Seringapatam.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[dungeon]] at [[Seringapatam]].]]\n\n===Firearms===\nThe Kodavas revered weapons, such as guns and the traditional sword and dagger, which are essential for their ceremonial purposes and in accordance to their religious and cultural customs.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> The Kodavas stood guard at the Mysore, Mangalore and Malabar boundary posts. The support of the Kodagu native police, army and offices, held by Jamma ryots (native militia farmers, also called jamma tenure-holders), who were mostly Kodavas while including people from a few other communities as well, exempted the Kodavas from the 1861 Indian Arms Act.<ref name=\"Muthanna1971\">{{cite book|author=I.

Kodava takk similarity in accent and pronunciation with that of [[Beary bashe]], a dialect spoken by [[Beary]]s of [[Coastal Karnataka]].<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\nFamily histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=palm, ole=leaf) are still preserved at Kodava [[Ainmanes]]. Appaneravanda Hardas [[Appachcha Kavi]] and [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] are the two important poets and writers of Kodava language. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. The most important Kodava literature, it is said to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, collection of the folklore of a community in an Indian language. The fourth edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy. Nearly two thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during our festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi.[[File:Coorgi-cox.jpg|right|thumb|Coorgi-cox alphabet]]\n\nKodava people are the native speakers of [[Kodava Takk|Kodava language]] are origins of district of Kodagu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|title=Kodava-speaking people seek one identity|access-date=12 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111002911/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|archive-date=11 January 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> As per 1991 census, the speakers of Kodava Takk make up to 0.25% of the total population of the Karnataka state.

[[Sacred groves]], known as devarakadu (devara = God's and kadu = forest), continue to be maintained in their natural state amongst the coffee plantations since the time of the Rajas.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Each village has at least one devarakadu, which is believed to be an abode of the gods, with strict laws and taboos against poaching and felling of trees. These groves are also an important storehouse of biodiversity in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Jamma===\nA system of land tenure, known as Jamma (privileged tenureship), was formerly instituted in Kodagu during the pre-colonial Paleri Dynasty of the Lingayat Rajas. Jamma agricultural lands were held almost exclusively by Kodavas as a hereditary right, and were both indivisible and inalienable. Importantly, rights over the adjacent uncultivated woods (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. The exclusion of plantation crops, such as coffee, from India's Land Ceiling Act has further insulated these holdings from post independence land reform efforts across India. Importantly, rights over the adjacent forests (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. A unique feature of Jamma tenure is that tree rights remained with the Rajas, and were subsequently transferred to the colonial and post-independence governments and remains an import determinant of land use practices in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Coorg 1870\">Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870)</ref>\n\n===Coffee cultivation===\nCoffee cultivatuion is widely believed to have been introduced in the western ghats from the Yemeni port of Mocha by the Muslim saint, Baba Budan, in the 16th century and some time after its introduction, coffee cultivation was embraced by the Kodavas in western Karnataka. Following the British annexation of Kodagu in 1834, large numbers of European planters began settling in the forested mountains to cultivate coffee, dramatically changing the economic and environmental management structures of Kodava society.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Today, more than one third of India's coffee is grown in [[Kodagu district]], making it the most important coffee growing district in India, the world's fifth largest coffee-producing country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThroughout the medieval period and until well into the 19th century, the Kodavas had a pre-eminent role in Kodagu. By the middle of the 19th century, however, this dominance started waning. British individuals bought large stretches of land in Coorg and founded plantations. Institutions like the joint family system began to disappear. A number of socio-religious reform movements in India took shape from the 1800s. The Kodavas also felt the need for reform in response to such changes. The sense of decline gave an impetus to the spirit of reform that expressed itself in the work of religious men like [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]]. Trouble arose for the community during the post-colonial years, after the Land Reform Act enacted in 1974. Many large land owners lost their lands to the tenants (land to the tiller) and the socio-economic structure of the prominent community of Kodavas changed irreversibly. These Land reforms led to massive loss of land-ownership by the Kodava gentry who were relegated to poverty overnight. The decline of Kodava dominance was however tempered by their conversion through the 20th century to the academic and professional classes and their dominance in Kodagu politics.[[File:KNPark.jpg|thumb|Kaveri River in Kushal Nagar]]\n\nEfforts by community leaders have brought together all Kodava groups the world over under an umbrella \" Federation of Kodava Samajas\". It is a federation of about 27 Kodava Samajas and is headquartered at Balagodu, Virajpet Taluk, [[Kodagu]] District.\n\nThe foundation of the Coorg Association (predecessor of the Bangalore Kodava Samaj) was laid in Bangalore, in 1912. The Kodava Samaja (R), Bangalore is an organisation created for the traditional and cultural conservation, social well-being and welfare of the Kodava community. It is headquartered at Vasanthnagar in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka State, India. Expatriate Kodavas both in other states of India as well as in countries other than India have formed Kodava Samajas (Kodava Associations) in their states and countries of domicile. Examples are the Bangalore Kodava Samaja (already mentioned) with 33 branches in Bangalore City, the Mysore Kodava Samaja, the Canadian Kodavas in North America and the Muscat Kodavas of Oman. These associations of non Kodagu origin retain the cultural uniqueness of the Kodavas at the same time adapting many practices to the times and country of their adoption.   Lately, some organisations including the ''Codava National Council (CNC)'' and ''Kodava Rashtriya Samiti'' are demanding Kodava homeland status and autonomy to Kodagu district.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103054215/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Codava National Council sets up global forum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103015923/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Dharna staged for Kodagu State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Correspondent|first1=DNA|title=Lok Sabha elections 2014: Separatist movements at the fore in Karnataka|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-lok-sabha-elections-2014-separatist-movements-at-the-fore-in-karnataka-1971256|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=DNA|publisher=DNA|date=22 March 2014}}</ref> The population of the Kodavas is around 1.5 lakh.<ref name=\"OBC list\">{{cite news|last1=CHINNAPPA|first1=JEEVAN|title=Will Kodavas be included in Central OBC list?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-kodavas-be-included-in-central-obc-list/article603460.ece|accessdate=17 September 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics and distribution==\n===Kodavas proper===\nThe Kodava community numbers about one-fifth out of a total population of over 500,000, in Kodagu. Many Kodava people have migrated to areas outside Kodagu, to other Indian cities and regions, predominantly to Bangalore, Mysore, Mangalore, Ooty, Chennai, Mumbai, Kerala, Hyderabad and Delhi for better job prospects. A few of them have now migrated outside India to foreign countries, like North America (the US and Canada), the Middle East (especially Dubai in UAE and Muscat in Oman), the UK and Australia (especially to Sydney where they are prominent members in the financial industry as well as contributing to the health industry).<ref name=\"ETHNOLINGUISTIC STUDY\">K.S. Rajyashree. [http://www.languageinindia.com/oct2001/kodavarajyashree.html ''Kodava Speech Community: an ethnolinguistic study'']. LanguageIndia.com, October 2001</ref>\n\n===Amma Kodavas===\n[[File:Ammakodagi.jpeg|thumb|upright|Amma Kodava (Kaveri Brahmin) family, Coorg, 1875]]\n\nBesides the Kodavas there were other indigenous people who followed the same culture and spoke the same [[Kodava language]]. One of them, the Amma Kodavas, were believed to be the original priests\u2019 at all important temples in Coorg including temples of Talakaveri, Igguthappa and Irupu. The religious customs and practices of the [[hill people]] of Coorg gradually and subtly began to be influenced by the Brahmin practises and rituals. The role of the Coorg priest, via: Amma Kodavas declined and that of the Brahmin priest increased. In due course, the Amma Kodavas had no role to play in the religious aspects of the people of Coorg.\n\nThe loss of this important role earned some powerful Brahmin sympathisers, one of whom was a Havyaka Brahmin Thimmapaya, who had a large following of Amma Kodavas. During the later part of the 19th century, it appears that an attempt was made for assimilating the Amma Kodavas into the Brahmin fold. One batch of Amma Kodavas performed the rites to wear the sacred thread. Another batch is reported to have done so early in the 20th Century. Both these batches were assigned the Gothra names of their Brahmin patrons. The process of assimilation did not move any further. Today, many of the Amma Kodavas wear the sacred thread, a large number of them performing the rites a day before marriage (not after puberty, as done by the mainstream Brahmins). There are as many, who do not wear the sacred thread. Some of the Amma Kodavas do not have gotras assigned to them. They are vegetarians and endogamous. However, all other social activities such as marriage, dress and festivals are similar to the Kodavas.\n<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\">1.\tB.L.Rice,  Mysore & Coorg Gazetteer, Vol-III. published in 1878,\n2.\tRev.H. Moegling \"Coorg Memoirs\" published as in 1855.\n3.\tM.N.Srinivas, \u2018Religion and Society among the Coorgs of South India\u2019 published in Oxford in 1951.</ref>\n\n===Kodagu Brahmins===\nKodagu Brahmins are people residing in coorg since haleri dynasty. They have said to be migrated during that period from South Canaran districts. Their prime occupation was to perform rituals and were priests in the temples of Kodagu. Kodagu Brahmins celebrate kodava festivals such as puthari, kaveri sankramana, kakkada padinett, but not kailpodh. They are pure vegetarians and wear the sacred thread. They however speak Kannada and kodava takk and follow kodava customs to an extent. They have clan system as well like the others some of them are, 'Cukkemane', 'Doddmane', 'Makkimane', 'Paremane', 'Kirumakki mane', 'Hulithala mane', 'Narasajjanamane', ' Kadangamakki mane', 'Nooroklunaadumane', 'Mottemane' , Mooterimane and many more. They worship spirits or'theray' and ancestors as well. They perform a ritual at every year end called \"Bhandaara pooje\" when all the clan members unite for the event.They have 'gothras' assigned just like the amma kodavas. Currently they have settled in bigger cities and even abroad for better occupations. They are also coffee planters and have made a mark in the military and defense services. Being a part of kodava society for many ages they are equipped with weapons i.e. 'thok' or 'kovi' and are used efficiently.They  have local cuisines as well like thambuli, majjigehuli, maange pajjii, kembu curry, kenjiruve kudi gojju etc. Jewelry includes 'jomaale', 'pavalamaale'or 'havaladasara', kadaga (coorg kada), 'pommaale' or 'muttina sara'and 'thaali'. Nowadays, 'kokkethaati' has become popular amongst few women.Women in this community have no custom of 'pathak' just like the amma kodavas.\n\n===Kodagu Heggade===\nThe Kodagu Heggades are another of these indigenous castes of Coorg although originally they were believed to have come from North Malabar.  They have around 100 family names.  They follow the Kodava habits and customs, dress like other Kodavas and speak [[Kodava Takk]].  The Kodagu Heggades and the Amma Kodavas are similar to the Kodavas and hence might have been related to them in the ancient past.<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\"/>\n\n===Kodava Maaples===\n[[Kodava Maaple]] is a Muslim  community residing in [[Kodagu]]  [[districts of Karnataka|district]] of [[Karnataka]] [[states and territories of India|State]] in southern [[India]]. In Coorg many Kodavas were converted into Islam during the rule of [[Tippu Sultan]] in Coorg. They are called the 'Kodava Maaple'  or  'Jamma Maaples' ( not to be confused with the [[Mapilla|Kerala Mappillas]]). However some of the Kodava Maaples have married with the [[Mappila|Kerala Mappilas]] and [[Beary|Mangalore Bearys]]. They contract marriage alliances with the Muslims of Coorg, Mangalore and Kerala. The Kodava Maaples belong to [[Sunni Islam]], refrain from alcohol and eat only Halal.  They maintained their original Kodava clan names and dress habits and spoke [[Coorg language]] although now they do follow some [[Kerala]] [[Muslim]] and [[Beary]] customs also.\n\n=== Others ===\nThese include communities such as,  Thiyya, Nair, Koleya, Airi, Malekudiya, Meda, Kembatti, Kapala, Kavadi, Kolla, Koyava, Banna, Golla, Kanya, Maleya and others. .Many of these communities had migrated into Kodagu from the Canara, Mysore and the Malabar regions during the period of Haleri Dynasty and to a certain extent culturally ingrained themselves in the Kodava Society. They speak [[Kodava takk]] and follow the Kodava customs and habits to some extent.<ref name=\"slavery in Coorg\">{{cite book|author =Lewis Rice|title=Mysore and Coorg gazette|year =1876|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924071131605|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924071131605/page/n225 212] and 213}}</ref>\n\nKodagu and Are Gowda\n(Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada Gowda) communities, as their name indicates, hail mostly from those districts. Originally they are the migrants from Ikkeri (Keladi) Maha Samsthana (present Shimoga, Chikka Magaluru and Hassan Districts). They were originally Natha Pantha and Shivaites owing allegiance to Kigga and Sringeri Matha. Later Emperor Vishnuvardhana's rule they became Vaishnavites and worship 'Tirupati Timmappa' (Balaji of Thirupati) and 'Sabbakka' (Sharada of Sringeri). They are also called Tuluva Gowdas as they spoke Tulu when they came from Ikkeri, later in the Haleri kingdom, and settled the Mangalore-Udupi (Dakshina Kannada-Udupi) region. They now speak the Are Bhashe or Gowda Kannada dialect of Tulu and Kannada. They are said to have 10 Kutumba and 18 Balis as their primordial root families, from which arose around a Nooru Mane or hundred families. In Kodagu, there were quite a few families settled in Kodagu from the time of Lingayat King of Coorg, Rev. G. Richter, in Gazetteer of Coorg (1870) lists them as Tulu Gowdas (Vokkaligas in Kodagu and Dakshin Kannada) who migrated to Coorg (Kodagu) from the Mangalor\n\n===Caste reservations===\nAround 2000, some of the [[Kodava language]] speakers were included in the [[Other Backward Classes]] list of [[Karnataka]].

Their most significant contributions are in the armed forces and in sports. Originally being land-owning militiamen farmers from [[Kodagu]], hence their traditional twin occupations were as agriculturists and as soldiers. The distinguished among them had been local chieftains, palace officials, officers of the Raja's army and brave battle veterans, therefore invariably having attained fame in either government service or in the local army. The Kodava ancestors grew paddy and plantation crops like bananas and pepper, their descendants are now into coffee cultivation.\n\n===Army===\nMany Kodavas joined the [[Indian armed forces]] both as officers and as servicemen. They distinguished themselves in times of war and peace, army-men are still shown the most respect in Kodagu (Coorg). Quite a number of Kodavas have been martyred on enemy frontiers. Many Kodavas participated in the two World Wars before Indian Independence and in the wars against China and Pakistan after 1947. There was a separate [[71st Coorg Rifles|Coorg regiment]] (now forming a unit of the Indian [[Regiment of Artillery]], this unit being called the 37 (Coorg) Anti-Tank Regiment RIA) which largely included people from non-Kodava backgrounds while the Kodavas themselves served in different other regiments; this is in keeping with the army's non-bias policy according to which people were recruited in regiments other than those belonging to their region and community of birth. Hence Field Marshal [[Cariappa]] of the [[Rajput Regiment]] and General [[Thimayya]] of the [[Kumaon Regiment]] were the most distinguished army-men among the Kodavas. Many other Kodavas have been made Lt. Generals, Major Generals, Brigadiers and Air Marshals. Lt. General A. C. Iyappa (or [[Apparanda Aiyappa]]) is best remembered for his contributions towards the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals|Corps of Signals]] and towards [[Bharat Electronics Limited]]. There were several war heroes as well such as Nadikerianda Bheemaiah, a JCO who was awarded the [[Vir Chakra]] for conspicuous bravery in J&K Operations in 1947, Air Marshal [[C D Subbaiah|Cheppudira D Subbaia]] who was a fighter pilot during WW II and was awarded the Vir Chakra and the PVSM, Squadron Leader [[Ajjamada B Devaiah]], (known as the 'wings of fire') another fighter pilot was awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] after he shot down an enemy aircraft and died in [[Pakistan]] during the 1965 Indo Pak War, Major Ganapathi Puttichanda Somiah, (known as the 'Major who kept his cool') awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, during the Indian Intervention in Sri Lanka, Major Ranjan Chengappa, [[Shaurya Chakra]] Awardee who was in Congo for UN mission as part of a peace keeping force, Col Chembanda M Thimanna, awarded the Shaurya Chakra for bravery in counter insurgency operations, Major Chottangada Ganesh Madappa, was awarded Shaurya Chakra posthumously in 1996, Squadron Leader [[M A Ganapathy|Mandepanda Appachu Ganapathy]], awarded the Vir Chakra in 1972 (when as a Flight Lieutenant he shot down Pakistani Sabre Jets). Major  (now Retd Maj Gen) K P Nanjappa was awarded the Vir Chakra in 1971.\n\n===Hockey===\nKodavas have a long history of association with the game of [[field hockey]].

This festival is recognised as one of the largest field hockey tournaments in the world and has been referred to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> However it has already found a mention in the [[Limca Book of Records]], which is an Indian variant of the Guinness Book.<ref name=\"cradle\"/>\n\n===Other Sports===\nKodavas have also been known in other individual sport events as well especially in athletics; [[Ashwini Nachappa]], National Champion in Athletics, Olympian and [[Arjuna Award]]ee, [[Rohan Bopanna]], National Tennis Champion, [[Joshna Chinappa]], Ace squash player, [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]], motor racing champions, [[C.C.

Of late Kodavas have begun to distinguish themselves in cricket. Robin Uthappa, K. P. Appanna, N. C. Aiyappa and Shyam Ponnappa have represented [[Karnataka]] state in national tournaments, like the [[Ranji trophy]], and Bangalore city in the [[Indian Premier League]]. Among them, [[Robin Uthappa]] went on to play for Indian National Cricket Team, as well.\n\n===Other fields===\nThe Kodavas language was a spoken language and had no written literature until 1900. Appanervanda Haridasa [[Appachcha Kavi]], [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] and Dr. [[I M Muthanna]], have contributed immensely towards developing a literature for this language. The Kodavas are almost all Hindus a few of them had taken up monkhood and contributed towards the development of the religion, especially in Kodagu and Mysore regions, the most famous among them being [[Swami Shambhavananda]], [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]] and [[Swami Narayanananda]]. In the government service as well there were many prominent Kodavas. One remembers [[Rao Bahadur IGP P.K.Monnappa]], for his contributions towards the [[Indian Police Service|Indian Police]] in South India, be it in Hyderabad, Madras, Mysore or Coorg. [[Diwan Bahadur Ketoli Chengappa]], was the last Chief Commissioner (the governor of a British province which had no elected assembly) of Coorg. There were others like Rai Saheb Muthanna who served in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Mesopotamia (Iraq) during WWII and Rao Saheb Pattamada Devaiah, SP of Coorg. Some were judges in the High Court, such as Palecanda Medappa for Mysore and Ajjikuttira S Bopantna for Karnataka. [[C M Poonacha]] had been the Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952\u2013'56), MP, Union Minister and later Governor of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. [[C B Muthamma]] was the first woman [[Indian Foreign Service]] officer. Mr CG Somaiah was the First IAS Officer to rise to the position of Home Secretary, Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAAG) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Ponnappa|first1=Lt.

Firstly, it is the name of the [[Kodava language]] and culture followed by a number of communities from [[Kodagu]]. Secondly, within the Kodava - speaking communities and region ([[Kodagu district|Kodagu]]) it describes the dominant Kodava people. The Kodavas ([[Kodava language|Kodava]], anglicised as Coorgs), are considered a patrilineal ethno-lingual tribe from the region of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]], (in [[Karnataka]] state of southern India), who natively speak the [[Kodava language]]. Traditionally they are land-owning agriculturists with martial customs. They practice family [[exogamy]] and caste [[endogamy]].

Forbes Watson (from NY public library)]]\nThe words ''Kodava'' (the indigenous people, language and culture) and ''Kodagu'' (the land) come from the same root word 'Koda' of unknown meaning. Some claim it means 'hills', others say it means 'west' but both relate to the Western Ghats' location. Kodagu is called ''Kodava Naad'' in the native [[Kodava language]]. The community members were called Kodava by the other natives and Coorgs by the British. They are ethnically and culturally distinct people. For centuries, the Kodavas have lived in Kodagu cultivating paddy fields, maintaining cattle herds and carrying arms during war.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Indigenous origin===\nThere are a variety of theories as to the origin of the Kodava, including theories of them being either the indigenous inhabitants of their region, or of foreign origins before two thousand years ago. However the foreign theories are mere speculations because they have found no concrete evidences.\n*As per the indigenous theory, Kodavas are the native inhabitants of Kodagu who learnt and practiced agriculture. Hence they were an ancient warlike tribe which got civilised over the centuries and gained prosperity.\n*Kodavas (Coorgs) may be the descendants of the [[Cephalic index#Cephalic index in human anthropology|broad headed]] (''brachycephalic'') stock who entered into the Indus Valley during the Mohenjodaro period before the Indo-Aryans and later migrated to the Coorg region (Hutton, as quoted by Balakrishnan in 1976).\n\n===Other origin speculations===\n* One view is that the Kodavas are descendants of [[Scythians]] (Connor 1870, Rice 1878). According to yet another but similar view, the Kodavas belong to the [[Indo-Scythian]] race like the [[Sakas]], the [[Western Satraps|Western Kshatrapas]] and the Thiyyar.\n\n===Consensus===\n* Kannada inscriptions speak of this region as being called ''Kudagu nad'' (parts of Kodagu, Western Mysore and Kerala) as well. Both the name of the natives and of the region are synonymous (Kodava-Kodavu; Kodaga-Kodagu; Coorgs-Coorg).<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\">{{cite book|last=Kamath|first=Dr. S.

An ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalakshmi, he had gone on pilgrimage to several holy places all over India. Chandra Varma had a privy army who escorted him on his campaigns until he came into Kodagu(Coorg). Coorg, the source of the River Kaveri, was uninhabited jungle land when he arrived to settle here. Thereafter he became the first Raja of the Coorg principality. He had 11 sons, the eldest among them was Devakantha who later succeeded him as Raja. They were married to the daughters of the Raja of Vidarbha.

The regions of Hassan, Kodagu (Coorg), Tulunad and Waynad were ruled between them. Later the cholas entered Karnataka to rule, but it was short lived. The [[Hoysala]]s succeeded them and ruled Southern Karnataka (including Tulunad and Coorg) and parts of Tamil Nadu. In the aftermath of the Delhi Sultanate invasion of South India (around 1319) the [[Vijaynagara]] Hindu Empire arose to rule South India until their downfall in the 16th century. From around 1600 until 1834 the [[Haleri Kingdom|Haleri Rajas]] ruled over Coorg.\n\nSamadhis were built for army chief Biddanda Bopu, who was the commander-in-chief for the army of Dodda Vira Rajendra, and his son Biddanda Somaiah.

The coconut, jackfruit, plantain, mango and other fruits and vegetables were widely used. Ghee was used in well-to-do families and on festive occasions. Rice in the form of Kanji or Koolu was served at meals along with curries and other additional dishes. Non-vegetarian food was not objectionable and alcoholic drinks as a rule weren't prohibited. Pork, chicken, river fish, were commonly consumed as also were varieties of game meat. Pork is a common dish at many households and the famous kodava 'Pandi Curry' is served along with 'Kadumbuttu' (steamed rice balls) which is almost deep Brown in color due to the use of garcinia cambogia vinegar called Kachumpuli. Sweet dishes like akki payasa were prepared during festive occasions. Other special dishes included otti (rice roti), paaputtu (similar to [[idli]]), [[Idiyappam|noolputtu]] (rice noodles), thambuttu (a sweet), etc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Organizational structure===\nKodava settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional [[Ainmanes|Ainmane]] houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape.  The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants and non-Kodavas. .<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Festivals==\n\nKodava festivities center around their agriculture and military tradition. Originally most of their lives were spent in the field: cultivating, harvesting and guarding their fields from the depredations of wild animals, or otherwise they were either waging war or hunting for game. Their new year was originally celebrated on Bishu Changrandi (called [[Vishu]] in Kerala and  [[Chithirai Thirunal]] in Tamil Nadu). The Kodavas began to celebrate a few Hindu festivals such as [[Ugadi]], [[Ayudha Puja]] (Dasara, also called Navratri, Vijaydashami, Durga Puja or Dussehra) and [[Mahashivaratri]] under the Haleri Rajas(1602\u20131834). However Kodavas traditionally celebrate the following three main festivals peculiar to Kodagu alone (two are cultural and one religious):\n\n===Kailpoldu (Festival of Arms)===\nKailpoldu is celebrated on 3 September. Officially, the festival begins on the 18th day after the sun enters the Simha Raasi (the Western sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]). Kail means weapon or armoury and Pold means festival. The day signifies the completion of \"nati\"&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the transplantation of the rice (paddy) crop. The festival signifies the day when men should prepare to guard their crop from wild boars and other animals, since during the preceding months, in which the family were engaged in the fields, all weapons were normally deposited in the \"Kanni Kombare\", or the prayer room. Hence on the day of Kailpoldu, the weapons are taken out of the Pooja room, cleaned and decorated with flowers. They are then kept in the \"Nellakki Nadubade\", the central hall of the house and the place of community worship. Each member of the family has a bath, after which they worship the weapons. Feasting and drinking follow. The eldest member of the family hands a gun to the senior member of the family, signifying the commencement of the festivities. The Menu for the day is Kadumbutte (Rice balls) and Pandhi Curry (Pork Curry) and Alcoholic beverages are also served. The whole family assembles in the \"Mand\" (open ground), where physical contests and sports, including marksmanship, are conducted. In the past the hunting and cooking of wild game was part of the celebration, but today shooting skills are tested by firing at a coconut tied onto the branch of a tall tree. Traditional rural sports, like grabbing a coconut from the hands of a group of 8\u201310 people (thenge porata), throwing a stone the size of a cricket ball at a coconut from a distance of 10\u201315 paces (thenge eed), lifting a stone ball of 30\u201340&nbsp;cm lying at one's feet and throwing it backwards over the shoulders, etc., are now conducted in community groups called Kodava Samajas in towns and cities.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Kaveri Sankramana (worship of river Kaveri)===\n[[File:1632 px - Talakaveri India.JPG|thumb|right|[[Talakaveri]], origin of the river Kaveri]]\nThe Kaveri Sankramana festival normally takes place in mid-October. It is associated with the river [[Kaveri]], which flows through the district from its source at [[Talakaveri]].At a predetermined time, when the sun enters Tula Rasi (Tula sankramana), a fountain from a small tank fills the larger holy tank at Talakaveri. Thousands of people gather to dip in this holy water. The water is collected in bottles and reaches every home throughout Kodagu. This holy water is called Theertha, and is preserved in all Kodava homes. A spoonful of this water is fed to the dying, in the belief that they will attain ''[[moksha]]'' (spiritual emancipation) and gain entry to heaven. On this day, married women wearing new silk saris perform ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' to a vegetable, symbolising the goddess Kaveri. The vegetable is usually a cucumber or a coconut, wrapped in a piece of red silk cloth and decorated with flowers and jewels (mainly 'Pathak' (Kodava Mangalasuthra)). This is called the Kanni Puje. The word Kanni denotes the goddess [[Parvati]], who incarnated as Kaveri. Three sets of [[betel]] leaves and [[areca]] nut are kept in front of the goddess with bunches of glass bangles. All the members of the family pray to the goddess by throwing rice and prostrating themselves before the image. The elder members of the family ceremonially bless the younger. An older married woman then draws water from the well and starts cooking. The menu of the day is dosa and vegetable curry (usually pumpkin curry (kumbala kari) ) and payasa. Nothing but vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and this is the only festival which is strictly vegetarian. Alcohol is prohibited. The Kaveri cult has its center and origin in Kodagu. It is only those Kodava rites associated with the river Kaveri that are Brahmanical in influence.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Puttari (Harvest festival)===\nPuttari means \"new rice\" and is the rice harvest festival (also called Huttari in Kannada). This takes place in late November or early December. Celebrations and preparations for this festival start a week in advance. On the day of Puttari, the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, kadambutt  pandhi curi and also a special food of yam and jaggery water which is eaten before going to the field. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of \"Poli Poli Deva\" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal. Dinner normally consists of meat dishes, such as pork, and mutton curry. Alcoholic beverages are also served at such feasts in Coorg.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Bhagmandala2.JPG|thumb|Bhagamandala temple]]\n[[File:Tank at Talakaveri.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===Shrines and deities===\nThe Kodavas have a local trinity comprising the ''Kuladevi'' (patron goddess) [[Kaveri]], ''Maguru'' (chief preceptor) [[Igguthappa]] and ''Guru Karana'' (revered common ancestor). The Kodavas of Kodagu are polytheist Hindus who believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements and their ancestors. Their chief deities are Bhagwathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Mahadeva  ([[Shiva]]),  [[Bhadrakali]] (a form of Parvati as Kali), Muthappa and Aiyappa.\n\nIgguthappa, the most important local God, is an incarnation of Lord Subramani, the God of snakes, rain, harvest and rice (Incidentally, the famous Kukke Subramani temple located near Kodagu is dedicated to snakes, hence Subramani is the God of snakes despite the misconception that his carrier, the peacock, which eats grains and insects, is wrongly believed to kill and eat snakes). The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. This is similar to the bhuta aradhana of Tulunad. There are many spirits worshipped in Kodagu. The Kodavas also practised snake worship. Consumption of soma (liquor) and pork is permitted,\n\nThey maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting and cutting trees was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. However these days the government and private speculative land buyers have acquired these sacred groves and converted them into farms for monetary gains and with disrespect towards native religious feelings. The Kodavas believe in astrology as well. Generally they don't follow idol worship but believe in nature worship.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\" /> \n[[File:The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri.jpg|left|thumb|The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri, the town is in the background]]\n\nOn their ancestral clan lands they have a shrine (Kaimada), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana - Karana). The spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\nEach village had a Bhagwathi, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an [[Ayyappa|Aiyappa]]. The Kodavas worshipped Mahadeva as well. Some of the main shrines of the Kodavas are the temples of Talakaveri, Bhagamandala, Padi Igguthappa, Peggala (Heggala), Kakot Parambu and Bythoor. The Kodavas also revere and visit the shrines of Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala Manjunatha in Tulunad.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Socio-religious link with North Malabar===\n[[File:Bali theyyam, Payyannur.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Theiray (Theyyam)]]\nThe word Kodakar was the Malayalam word for a Kodava, and it comes from the word \"Kodag-kara\". The ancient Kodavas of Kodagu had land trade with Northern Malabar, especially with [[Thalassery]] (Tellicherry) port on the coast, and would also go on regular pilgrimage to the temples of the region. Devotees from Kodagu were, and still are, frequent visitors to the temples of Kannur and Waynad (districts of North Kerala). These temples are in places like Baithur or Bythoor (Vayathur and [[Ulikkal]]), [[Payyavoor]], Parassinikkadavu, Thirunelli, Kanjirath, Nileshwar and Payyanur. Also the Nambima (Namboothiri) priests of North Malabar traditionally served as the temple priests in the temples of Kodagu. The folk songs of the Kodavas speak of the temple deities having originated in North Malabar. These folk songs while talking of Kodagu and its people also mention the temple regions as well as the [[Thiyya]], Nambiya (Nambiar), the Nambima (Namboothiri) and the Nayamma (the Kodava word for Nair - in Malayalam Nayanmmar means Nairs) people of Northern Malabar.\n\nBaithurappa (Bythoorappa) is a chief deity of the Kodavas. The Puggera family of Kodavas were hereditary temple managers at the Bythoor (Vayathur, in Kerala and near Karnataka's Kodagu border) temple which was in the dominion of the Kalliat Nambiar, who like the Kolathiri (Chera Raja) was an ally of the Kodavas. Every year Kodavas from Southern Kodagu pilgrimage to this place. Likewise the Bovverianda and the Mundiolanda families of Kodavas were the hereditary temple managers at the Payyavur temple which was under the Kolathiri (Chera) kings. This is because a few of the Kodavas lived in North Malabar in the [[Taliparamba]] (ancient capital of the Cheras) region in the ancient past and fought on their side as mercenary soldiers.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n[[File:Dungeon dwelling of Seringapatam.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[dungeon]] at [[Seringapatam]].]]\n\n===Firearms===\nThe Kodavas revered weapons, such as guns and the traditional sword and dagger, which are essential for their ceremonial purposes and in accordance to their religious and cultural customs.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> The Kodavas stood guard at the Mysore, Mangalore and Malabar boundary posts. The support of the Kodagu native police, army and offices, held by Jamma ryots (native militia farmers, also called jamma tenure-holders), who were mostly Kodavas while including people from a few other communities as well, exempted the Kodavas from the 1861 Indian Arms Act.<ref name=\"Muthanna1971\">{{cite book|author=I.

Kodava takk similarity in accent and pronunciation with that of [[Beary bashe]], a dialect spoken by [[Beary]]s of [[Coastal Karnataka]].<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\nFamily histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=palm, ole=leaf) are still preserved at Kodava [[Ainmanes]]. Appaneravanda Hardas [[Appachcha Kavi]] and [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] are the two important poets and writers of Kodava language. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. The most important Kodava literature, it is said to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, collection of the folklore of a community in an Indian language. The fourth edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy. Nearly two thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during our festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi.[[File:Coorgi-cox.jpg|right|thumb|Coorgi-cox alphabet]]\n\nKodava people are the native speakers of [[Kodava Takk|Kodava language]] are origins of district of Kodagu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|title=Kodava-speaking people seek one identity|access-date=12 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111002911/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|archive-date=11 January 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> As per 1991 census, the speakers of Kodava Takk make up to 0.25% of the total population of the Karnataka state.

[[Sacred groves]], known as devarakadu (devara = God's and kadu = forest), continue to be maintained in their natural state amongst the coffee plantations since the time of the Rajas.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Each village has at least one devarakadu, which is believed to be an abode of the gods, with strict laws and taboos against poaching and felling of trees. These groves are also an important storehouse of biodiversity in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Jamma===\nA system of land tenure, known as Jamma (privileged tenureship), was formerly instituted in Kodagu during the pre-colonial Paleri Dynasty of the Lingayat Rajas. Jamma agricultural lands were held almost exclusively by Kodavas as a hereditary right, and were both indivisible and inalienable. Importantly, rights over the adjacent uncultivated woods (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. The exclusion of plantation crops, such as coffee, from India's Land Ceiling Act has further insulated these holdings from post independence land reform efforts across India. Importantly, rights over the adjacent forests (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. A unique feature of Jamma tenure is that tree rights remained with the Rajas, and were subsequently transferred to the colonial and post-independence governments and remains an import determinant of land use practices in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Coorg 1870\">Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870)</ref>\n\n===Coffee cultivation===\nCoffee cultivatuion is widely believed to have been introduced in the western ghats from the Yemeni port of Mocha by the Muslim saint, Baba Budan, in the 16th century and some time after its introduction, coffee cultivation was embraced by the Kodavas in western Karnataka. Following the British annexation of Kodagu in 1834, large numbers of European planters began settling in the forested mountains to cultivate coffee, dramatically changing the economic and environmental management structures of Kodava society.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Today, more than one third of India's coffee is grown in [[Kodagu district]], making it the most important coffee growing district in India, the world's fifth largest coffee-producing country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThroughout the medieval period and until well into the 19th century, the Kodavas had a pre-eminent role in Kodagu. By the middle of the 19th century, however, this dominance started waning. British individuals bought large stretches of land in Coorg and founded plantations. Institutions like the joint family system began to disappear. A number of socio-religious reform movements in India took shape from the 1800s. The Kodavas also felt the need for reform in response to such changes. The sense of decline gave an impetus to the spirit of reform that expressed itself in the work of religious men like [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]]. Trouble arose for the community during the post-colonial years, after the Land Reform Act enacted in 1974. Many large land owners lost their lands to the tenants (land to the tiller) and the socio-economic structure of the prominent community of Kodavas changed irreversibly. These Land reforms led to massive loss of land-ownership by the Kodava gentry who were relegated to poverty overnight. The decline of Kodava dominance was however tempered by their conversion through the 20th century to the academic and professional classes and their dominance in Kodagu politics.[[File:KNPark.jpg|thumb|Kaveri River in Kushal Nagar]]\n\nEfforts by community leaders have brought together all Kodava groups the world over under an umbrella \" Federation of Kodava Samajas\". It is a federation of about 27 Kodava Samajas and is headquartered at Balagodu, Virajpet Taluk, [[Kodagu]] District.\n\nThe foundation of the Coorg Association (predecessor of the Bangalore Kodava Samaj) was laid in Bangalore, in 1912. The Kodava Samaja (R), Bangalore is an organisation created for the traditional and cultural conservation, social well-being and welfare of the Kodava community. It is headquartered at Vasanthnagar in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka State, India. Expatriate Kodavas both in other states of India as well as in countries other than India have formed Kodava Samajas (Kodava Associations) in their states and countries of domicile. Examples are the Bangalore Kodava Samaja (already mentioned) with 33 branches in Bangalore City, the Mysore Kodava Samaja, the Canadian Kodavas in North America and the Muscat Kodavas of Oman. These associations of non Kodagu origin retain the cultural uniqueness of the Kodavas at the same time adapting many practices to the times and country of their adoption.   Lately, some organisations including the ''Codava National Council (CNC)'' and ''Kodava Rashtriya Samiti'' are demanding Kodava homeland status and autonomy to Kodagu district.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103054215/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Codava National Council sets up global forum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103015923/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Dharna staged for Kodagu State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Correspondent|first1=DNA|title=Lok Sabha elections 2014: Separatist movements at the fore in Karnataka|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-lok-sabha-elections-2014-separatist-movements-at-the-fore-in-karnataka-1971256|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=DNA|publisher=DNA|date=22 March 2014}}</ref> The population of the Kodavas is around 1.5 lakh.<ref name=\"OBC list\">{{cite news|last1=CHINNAPPA|first1=JEEVAN|title=Will Kodavas be included in Central OBC list?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-kodavas-be-included-in-central-obc-list/article603460.ece|accessdate=17 September 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics and distribution==\n===Kodavas proper===\nThe Kodava community numbers about one-fifth out of a total population of over 500,000, in Kodagu. Many Kodava people have migrated to areas outside Kodagu, to other Indian cities and regions, predominantly to Bangalore, Mysore, Mangalore, Ooty, Chennai, Mumbai, Kerala, Hyderabad and Delhi for better job prospects. A few of them have now migrated outside India to foreign countries, like North America (the US and Canada), the Middle East (especially Dubai in UAE and Muscat in Oman), the UK and Australia (especially to Sydney where they are prominent members in the financial industry as well as contributing to the health industry).<ref name=\"ETHNOLINGUISTIC STUDY\">K.S. Rajyashree. [http://www.languageinindia.com/oct2001/kodavarajyashree.html ''Kodava Speech Community: an ethnolinguistic study'']. LanguageIndia.com, October 2001</ref>\n\n===Amma Kodavas===\n[[File:Ammakodagi.jpeg|thumb|upright|Amma Kodava (Kaveri Brahmin) family, Coorg, 1875]]\n\nBesides the Kodavas there were other indigenous people who followed the same culture and spoke the same [[Kodava language]]. One of them, the Amma Kodavas, were believed to be the original priests\u2019 at all important temples in Coorg including temples of Talakaveri, Igguthappa and Irupu. The religious customs and practices of the [[hill people]] of Coorg gradually and subtly began to be influenced by the Brahmin practises and rituals. The role of the Coorg priest, via: Amma Kodavas declined and that of the Brahmin priest increased. In due course, the Amma Kodavas had no role to play in the religious aspects of the people of Coorg.\n\nThe loss of this important role earned some powerful Brahmin sympathisers, one of whom was a Havyaka Brahmin Thimmapaya, who had a large following of Amma Kodavas. During the later part of the 19th century, it appears that an attempt was made for assimilating the Amma Kodavas into the Brahmin fold. One batch of Amma Kodavas performed the rites to wear the sacred thread. Another batch is reported to have done so early in the 20th Century. Both these batches were assigned the Gothra names of their Brahmin patrons. The process of assimilation did not move any further. Today, many of the Amma Kodavas wear the sacred thread, a large number of them performing the rites a day before marriage (not after puberty, as done by the mainstream Brahmins). There are as many, who do not wear the sacred thread. Some of the Amma Kodavas do not have gotras assigned to them. They are vegetarians and endogamous. However, all other social activities such as marriage, dress and festivals are similar to the Kodavas.\n<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\">1.\tB.L.Rice,  Mysore & Coorg Gazetteer, Vol-III. published in 1878,\n2.\tRev.H. Moegling \"Coorg Memoirs\" published as in 1855.\n3.\tM.N.Srinivas, \u2018Religion and Society among the Coorgs of South India\u2019 published in Oxford in 1951.</ref>\n\n===Kodagu Brahmins===\nKodagu Brahmins are people residing in coorg since haleri dynasty. They have said to be migrated during that period from South Canaran districts. Their prime occupation was to perform rituals and were priests in the temples of Kodagu. Kodagu Brahmins celebrate kodava festivals such as puthari, kaveri sankramana, kakkada padinett, but not kailpodh. They are pure vegetarians and wear the sacred thread. They however speak Kannada and kodava takk and follow kodava customs to an extent. They have clan system as well like the others some of them are, 'Cukkemane', 'Doddmane', 'Makkimane', 'Paremane', 'Kirumakki mane', 'Hulithala mane', 'Narasajjanamane', ' Kadangamakki mane', 'Nooroklunaadumane', 'Mottemane' , Mooterimane and many more. They worship spirits or'theray' and ancestors as well. They perform a ritual at every year end called \"Bhandaara pooje\" when all the clan members unite for the event.They have 'gothras' assigned just like the amma kodavas. Currently they have settled in bigger cities and even abroad for better occupations. They are also coffee planters and have made a mark in the military and defense services. Being a part of kodava society for many ages they are equipped with weapons i.e. 'thok' or 'kovi' and are used efficiently.They  have local cuisines as well like thambuli, majjigehuli, maange pajjii, kembu curry, kenjiruve kudi gojju etc. Jewelry includes 'jomaale', 'pavalamaale'or 'havaladasara', kadaga (coorg kada), 'pommaale' or 'muttina sara'and 'thaali'. Nowadays, 'kokkethaati' has become popular amongst few women.Women in this community have no custom of 'pathak' just like the amma kodavas.\n\n===Kodagu Heggade===\nThe Kodagu Heggades are another of these indigenous castes of Coorg although originally they were believed to have come from North Malabar.  They have around 100 family names.  They follow the Kodava habits and customs, dress like other Kodavas and speak [[Kodava Takk]].  The Kodagu Heggades and the Amma Kodavas are similar to the Kodavas and hence might have been related to them in the ancient past.<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\"/>\n\n===Kodava Maaples===\n[[Kodava Maaple]] is a Muslim  community residing in [[Kodagu]]  [[districts of Karnataka|district]] of [[Karnataka]] [[states and territories of India|State]] in southern [[India]]. In Coorg many Kodavas were converted into Islam during the rule of [[Tippu Sultan]] in Coorg. They are called the 'Kodava Maaple'  or  'Jamma Maaples' ( not to be confused with the [[Mapilla|Kerala Mappillas]]). However some of the Kodava Maaples have married with the [[Mappila|Kerala Mappilas]] and [[Beary|Mangalore Bearys]]. They contract marriage alliances with the Muslims of Coorg, Mangalore and Kerala. The Kodava Maaples belong to [[Sunni Islam]], refrain from alcohol and eat only Halal.  They maintained their original Kodava clan names and dress habits and spoke [[Coorg language]] although now they do follow some [[Kerala]] [[Muslim]] and [[Beary]] customs also.\n\n=== Others ===\nThese include communities such as,  Thiyya, Nair, Koleya, Airi, Malekudiya, Meda, Kembatti, Kapala, Kavadi, Kolla, Koyava, Banna, Golla, Kanya, Maleya and others. .Many of these communities had migrated into Kodagu from the Canara, Mysore and the Malabar regions during the period of Haleri Dynasty and to a certain extent culturally ingrained themselves in the Kodava Society. They speak [[Kodava takk]] and follow the Kodava customs and habits to some extent.<ref name=\"slavery in Coorg\">{{cite book|author =Lewis Rice|title=Mysore and Coorg gazette|year =1876|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924071131605|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924071131605/page/n225 212] and 213}}</ref>\n\nKodagu and Are Gowda\n(Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada Gowda) communities, as their name indicates, hail mostly from those districts. Originally they are the migrants from Ikkeri (Keladi) Maha Samsthana (present Shimoga, Chikka Magaluru and Hassan Districts). They were originally Natha Pantha and Shivaites owing allegiance to Kigga and Sringeri Matha. Later Emperor Vishnuvardhana's rule they became Vaishnavites and worship 'Tirupati Timmappa' (Balaji of Thirupati) and 'Sabbakka' (Sharada of Sringeri). They are also called Tuluva Gowdas as they spoke Tulu when they came from Ikkeri, later in the Haleri kingdom, and settled the Mangalore-Udupi (Dakshina Kannada-Udupi) region. They now speak the Are Bhashe or Gowda Kannada dialect of Tulu and Kannada. They are said to have 10 Kutumba and 18 Balis as their primordial root families, from which arose around a Nooru Mane or hundred families. In Kodagu, there were quite a few families settled in Kodagu from the time of Lingayat King of Coorg, Rev. G. Richter, in Gazetteer of Coorg (1870) lists them as Tulu Gowdas (Vokkaligas in Kodagu and Dakshin Kannada) who migrated to Coorg (Kodagu) from the Mangalor\n\n===Caste reservations===\nAround 2000, some of the [[Kodava language]] speakers were included in the [[Other Backward Classes]] list of [[Karnataka]].

Their most significant contributions are in the armed forces and in sports. Originally being land-owning militiamen farmers from [[Kodagu]], hence their traditional twin occupations were as agriculturists and as soldiers. The distinguished among them had been local chieftains, palace officials, officers of the Raja's army and brave battle veterans, therefore invariably having attained fame in either government service or in the local army. The Kodava ancestors grew paddy and plantation crops like bananas and pepper, their descendants are now into coffee cultivation.\n\n===Army===\nMany Kodavas joined the [[Indian armed forces]] both as officers and as servicemen. They distinguished themselves in times of war and peace, army-men are still shown the most respect in Kodagu (Coorg). Quite a number of Kodavas have been martyred on enemy frontiers. Many Kodavas participated in the two World Wars before Indian Independence and in the wars against China and Pakistan after 1947. There was a separate [[71st Coorg Rifles|Coorg regiment]] (now forming a unit of the Indian [[Regiment of Artillery]], this unit being called the 37 (Coorg) Anti-Tank Regiment RIA) which largely included people from non-Kodava backgrounds while the Kodavas themselves served in different other regiments; this is in keeping with the army's non-bias policy according to which people were recruited in regiments other than those belonging to their region and community of birth. Hence Field Marshal [[Cariappa]] of the [[Rajput Regiment]] and General [[Thimayya]] of the [[Kumaon Regiment]] were the most distinguished army-men among the Kodavas. Many other Kodavas have been made Lt. Generals, Major Generals, Brigadiers and Air Marshals. Lt. General A. C. Iyappa (or [[Apparanda Aiyappa]]) is best remembered for his contributions towards the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals|Corps of Signals]] and towards [[Bharat Electronics Limited]]. There were several war heroes as well such as Nadikerianda Bheemaiah, a JCO who was awarded the [[Vir Chakra]] for conspicuous bravery in J&K Operations in 1947, Air Marshal [[C D Subbaiah|Cheppudira D Subbaia]] who was a fighter pilot during WW II and was awarded the Vir Chakra and the PVSM, Squadron Leader [[Ajjamada B Devaiah]], (known as the 'wings of fire') another fighter pilot was awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] after he shot down an enemy aircraft and died in [[Pakistan]] during the 1965 Indo Pak War, Major Ganapathi Puttichanda Somiah, (known as the 'Major who kept his cool') awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, during the Indian Intervention in Sri Lanka, Major Ranjan Chengappa, [[Shaurya Chakra]] Awardee who was in Congo for UN mission as part of a peace keeping force, Col Chembanda M Thimanna, awarded the Shaurya Chakra for bravery in counter insurgency operations, Major Chottangada Ganesh Madappa, was awarded Shaurya Chakra posthumously in 1996, Squadron Leader [[M A Ganapathy|Mandepanda Appachu Ganapathy]], awarded the Vir Chakra in 1972 (when as a Flight Lieutenant he shot down Pakistani Sabre Jets). Major  (now Retd Maj Gen) K P Nanjappa was awarded the Vir Chakra in 1971.\n\n===Hockey===\nKodavas have a long history of association with the game of [[field hockey]]. The district of [[Kodagu]] is considered as the ''cradle of [[India]]n hockey''.<ref name=\"cradle\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/06/13/stories/2004061300490800.htm|title=Time-out|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2004-06-13|publisher=2004, The Hindu|accessdate=21 June 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=13 June 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"dh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|title=Coorg: A nursery of Indian hockey|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2006-04-04|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.|accessdate=21 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115244/http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> More than 50 Kodavas have represented India in international hockey tournaments, [[M. P. Ganesh]], [[Sommayya Maneypande|M.M Somaiah]], B. K. Subramani, A. B. Subbaiah, K. M. Chengappa, .K. K. Poonacha, C. S. Poonacha, Jagadish Ponnappa, M.A.Bopanna, Len Ayyappa, Amar Aiyamma to name a few, out of whom 7 have also participated in the [[Olympics]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> The passion for hockey in [[Kodagu]] is so much that teams representing more than each of 200 families participate in an annual [[Kodava Hockey Festival]]. This festival is recognised as one of the largest field hockey tournaments in the world and has been referred to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> However it has already found a mention in the [[Limca Book of Records]], which is an Indian variant of the Guinness Book.<ref name=\"cradle\"/>\n\n===Other Sports===\nKodavas have also been known in other individual sport events as well especially in athletics; [[Ashwini Nachappa]], National Champion in Athletics, Olympian and [[Arjuna Award]]ee, [[Rohan Bopanna]], National Tennis Champion, [[Joshna Chinappa]], Ace squash player, [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]], motor racing champions, [[C.C. Machaiah]], (Chenanda Machiah) National boxing Champion, Olympian and Arjuna Awardee, [[Reeth Abraham]] (n\u00e9e Devaiah; of Kodava parentage), National Athletics Champion, Arjuna Awardee and Olympian, Arjun Devaiah, National Athlete and Arjuna Award winner, Pramila Aiyappa (n\u00e9e Ganapathy), National Champion in Athletics and Olympian, P G Chengappa, Former National Badminton Player, M R Poovamma (Maachettira Poovamma), National Champion in Athletics and Olympian and [[Ashwini Ponnappa]], national badminton player. Of late Kodavas have begun to distinguish themselves in cricket. Robin Uthappa, K. P. Appanna, N. C. Aiyappa and Shyam Ponnappa have represented [[Karnataka]] state in national tournaments, like the [[Ranji trophy]], and Bangalore city in the [[Indian Premier League]]. Among them, [[Robin Uthappa]] went on to play for Indian National Cricket Team, as well.\n\n===Other fields===\nThe Kodavas language was a spoken language and had no written literature until 1900. Appanervanda Haridasa [[Appachcha Kavi]], [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] and Dr. [[I M Muthanna]], have contributed immensely towards developing a literature for this language. The Kodavas are almost all Hindus a few of them had taken up monkhood and contributed towards the development of the religion, especially in Kodagu and Mysore regions, the most famous among them being [[Swami Shambhavananda]], [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]] and [[Swami Narayanananda]]. In the government service as well there were many prominent Kodavas. One remembers [[Rao Bahadur IGP P.K.Monnappa]], for his contributions towards the [[Indian Police Service|Indian Police]] in South India, be it in Hyderabad, Madras, Mysore or Coorg. [[Diwan Bahadur Ketoli Chengappa]], was the last Chief Commissioner (the governor of a British province which had no elected assembly) of Coorg. There were others like Rai Saheb Muthanna who served in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Mesopotamia (Iraq) during WWII and Rao Saheb Pattamada Devaiah, SP of Coorg. Some were judges in the High Court, such as Palecanda Medappa for Mysore and Ajjikuttira S Bopantna for Karnataka. [[C M Poonacha]] had been the Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952\u2013'56), MP, Union Minister and later Governor of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. [[C B Muthamma]] was the first woman [[Indian Foreign Service]] officer. Mr CG Somaiah was the First IAS Officer to rise to the position of Home Secretary, Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAAG) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Ponnappa|first1=Lt.
