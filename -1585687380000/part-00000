It is the 54th entry in the series released by [[Columbia Pictures]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Stooges are Click, Clack and Cluck, [[paparazzi]]-like photographers working for Whack Magazine (\"If it's a good picture, it's out of Whack!\"). After failing in their attempts to get a photo of movie star Percival De Puyster and his new bride, their boss Mr. Wilson ([[Vernon Dent]]) fires them. But Wilson changes his mind and instead sends the Stooges to Vulgaria (an obvious parody of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]) for their next job, knowing full well that taking pictures in Vulgaria is against the law and punishable by death. The inept trio arrive and inadvertently let another photographer who was to be shot escape. The Stooges themselves try to escape but end up running into a Vulgarian prison. As the firing squad is setting up for the Stooges' execution, Curly requests one last smoke, leading to him pulling out a cigar the length of a hero sandwich. After he finishes it, the firing squad open fire, but the trio run off with their heads inside their shirts.\n\nThree Vulgarian officers watch a demonstration of their country's new ray gun which can fire other guns remotely. When they hear of the Stooges' escape, they leave the officer's office. The Stooges soon arrive in the office and discover the ray gun, which they think is a new camera. But when Moe and Larry pose in front of the gun, Curly manages to shoot their belts and hats off. The Stooges hide as they hear the officers returning, with Curly taking refuge inside the radio, destroying the wiring in the process.

It is the 54th entry in the series released by [[Columbia Pictures]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Stooges are Click, Clack and Cluck, [[paparazzi]]-like photographers working for Whack Magazine (\"If it's a good picture, it's out of Whack!\"). After failing in their attempts to get a photo of movie star Percival De Puyster and his new bride, their boss Mr. Wilson ([[Vernon Dent]]) fires them. But Wilson changes his mind and instead sends the Stooges to Vulgaria (an obvious parody of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]) for their next job, knowing full well that taking pictures in Vulgaria is against the law and punishable by death. The inept trio arrive and inadvertently let another photographer who was to be shot escape. The Stooges themselves try to escape but end up running into a Vulgarian prison. As the firing squad is setting up for the Stooges' execution, Curly requests one last smoke, leading to him pulling out a cigar the length of a hero sandwich. After he finishes it, the firing squad open fire, but the trio run off with their heads inside their shirts.\n\nThree Vulgarian officers watch a demonstration of their country's new ray gun which can fire other guns remotely. When they hear of the Stooges' escape, they leave the officer's office. The Stooges soon arrive in the office and discover the ray gun, which they think is a new camera. But when Moe and Larry pose in front of the gun, Curly manages to shoot their belts and hats off. The Stooges hide as they hear the officers returning, with Curly taking refuge inside the radio, destroying the wiring in the process. When the officers try to turn on the radio, Curly pulls out a large harmonica and begins playing, while strumming the remaining wires like a harp and banging inside the radio with [[xylophone]] mallets. The officers discover Curly, who jumps out of a window to escape. Moe and Larry trap the officers' heads in the window while Curly hits the officers in the head with his mallets.\n\nThe Stooges are now dressed in the Vulgarian officers' uniforms and end up in a local cafe, in which Curly pits his wits against a strong drink, and then a defiant oyster in his stew. When the oyster works Curly's last nerve, he pulls out his gun and fires at it repeatedly. This gets the attention of the guards, who promptly capture the Stooges and carry them off (literally), upside down, on the bayonets of their guns.\n\n==Production notes==\nFilmed on August 1-5, 1940,<ref name=pauley>{{cite book | last = Pauley | first = Jim | title = The Three Stooges Hollywood Filming Locations | publisher = Santa Monica Press, LLC | year = 2012 | location = [[Solana Beach, California]] | pages = 91 | url = http://www.santamonicapress.com/index.php?page_name=threestooges&page_type=book&show=desc&hide0=excerpt&hide1=author&hide2=reviews&hide5=number5 | isbn = 9781595800701}}</ref> the film title is a play on \"beautiful but dumb.\"<ref name=Solomon>{{cite book| last = Solomon | first = Jon | title = The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion | publisher = Comedy III Productions, Inc | year = 2002 | location = [[Glendale, California]] | pages = 190\u2013191 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Three-Stooges-Filmography-Companion/dp/0971186804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201570359&sr=1-1 | isbn = 0-9711868-0-4}}</ref>\n\nAn adaptation of the oyster soup battle is featured in [[The Three Stooges (video game)|The Three Stooges video game]], where players control Curly who attempts to pick up and eat as many crackers from the oyster soup as possible before the oysters do.

''King of Fighters XIII'' was released for Japanese [[arcade game|arcades]] on July 14, 2010, while ports for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] were released during late 2011 in Japanese and English regions, with [[Atlus USA]] and [[Rising Star Games]] being in charge of releasing them in the United States and Europe respectively. Versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] followed in 2011 and 2012. A PC version was released on Steam on September 13, 2013.\n\nThe game is set after the events from ''[[The King of Fighters XI]]'' and is also the conclusion of [[Ash Crimson]]'s [[story arc]], which started in ''[[The King of Fighters 2003]]''. It follows another King of Fighters tournament secretly hosted by Those From the Distance Land, the organization behind the events from the two prior games that are trying to break the seal of the demon Orochi and take its power.\n\nReleased after ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', the game was directed by Kei Yamamoto who wanted to bring elements from prior ''The King of Fighters'' titles and fix issues from the prior game. This title significantly modifies the gameplay from its predecessor, removing some modes, and adding ones formerly used in the series. It also expands the character roster, re-grouping the playable characters into three-member teams as in the prior installments. The ports are notable for including more content than the original version such as new characters, stages and game modes. Critical reception has been positive.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:The King of Fighters XIII gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot showing a fight in ''The King of Fighters XIII'', featuring Maxima fighting against Elisabeth Blanctorche]]\n\nThe game removes some of the [[gameplay]] system features used in the [[The King of Fighters XII|prior game]]: the Guard Attack, the Critical Counter, the Clash System, as well as the dynamic, zooming camera. In their place, three new features have been added. The first of the three is the new EX Mode, which convert each character's super moves into more powerful versions that allows one bar from the player's power gauge for EX Special Moves and two bars from the player's power gauge for EX Super Special Moves. Another new feature is the Hyper Drive mode, which gives the player unlimited use of Drive Cancels for a while once the Hyper Drive Gauge has been maxed, and the last new feature confirmed for the game is the Drive Cancel, which opens up new [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] possibilities. The game also marks the return of the multi-bar power gauge that was introduced in ''[[The King of Fighters '97]]''.<ref name=AshSaga/> In addition to standard and EX Desperation Moves, a new class of Desperation Move called Neo Max is included in the game and require that three stocks of gauge be exchanged to perform one, making it similar to Hidden Super Desperation Moves from ''[[The King of Fighters 2002]]'' and Leader Super Special Moves from ''[[The King of Fighters 2003]]''. These can also be cancelled from standard Desperation Moves, making them similar to the Dream Cancels from ''[[The King of Fighters XI]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/kof-xiii/system/neomax.html|publisher=SNK Playmore|title=Neo Max\u8d85\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280 \uff06 Max\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb The King of Fighters XIII|accessdate=April 24, 2010|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053313/http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/kof-xiii/system/neomax.html|archivedate=April 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe console version is based on the 1.1 update of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' arcade which fixed several issues from the original version.<ref name=\"e3prev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/the-king-of-fighters-xiii/preview_6318806.html|website=GameSpot|title=E3 2011: The King of Fighters XIII Hands-On Preview&nbsp;\u2013 Early Details|author=Park, Andrew|accessdate=June 9, 2011|date=August 3, 2011}}</ref> It also contains a story mode that influenced by the player's actions with various perspectives being available.

Saiki intends to use the energy expended by the winning team to enable him to cross time. However, as the fight rages, Botan notes that the gate that links them to the past is starting to close despite the battle. Before Saiki can act, he is ambushed by Ash Crimson, who steals his power. It is revealed then that, while Ash was enlisted by Saiki to obtain the Three Sacred Treasures to power the time gate, Ash had no intention of helping Saiki. Ash is suddenly overtaken by Saiki's persona, who then attempts to cross the time gate in Ash's body. The winning team pursues him into the time gate and the final battle of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' begins inside the time gate. Saiki is defeated in the gate but persists on crossing over to the past, believing it means nothing since he can return to the past and then cross the gate again to attempt his plan anew. However, Ash halts his attempt and allows the gate to close, leaving Saiki trapped in the present. Furthermore, Ash reveals that he is a descendant of Saiki. By locking Saiki out of the gate, he denies Saiki's existence in the past and forces his own existence to cease. As Ash vanishes from the living world, the flow of time resumes. In the epilogue of the Story Mode, in the dimensional rift, a spear appeared in front of Shroom and Rimelo, two members of Those From The Past who faced Kyo in the opening of the game (Console version). More surprising, Shion appeared before them, revealed that he's still alive.\n\n==Characters==\n{{further|List of The King of Fighters characters}}\n\nThe roster of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' features all the characters who appeared in ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', including the two console-exclusive characters, Elisabeth Branctorche and Mature.

XIII|lead=yes}} is a [[fighting game]] in ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series, developed and published by [[SNK Playmore]] originally in 2010. ''King of Fighters XIII'' was released for Japanese [[arcade game|arcades]] on July 14, 2010, while ports for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] were released during late 2011 in Japanese and English regions, with [[Atlus USA]] and [[Rising Star Games]] being in charge of releasing them in the United States and Europe respectively. Versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] followed in 2011\u20132012. A PC version was released on Steam on September 13, 2013.\n\nThe game is set after the events from ''[[The King of Fighters XI]]'' and is also the conclusion of [[Ash Crimson]]'s [[story arc]], which started in ''[[The King of Fighters 2003]]''. It follows another King of Fighters tournament secretly hosted by Those From the Distance Land, the organization behind the events from the two prior games that are trying to break the seal of the demon Orochi and take its power.\n\nReleased after ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', the game was directed by Kei Yamamoto who wanted to bring elements from prior ''The King of Fighters'' titles and fix issues from the prior game. This title significantly modifies the gameplay from its predecessor, removing some modes, and adding ones formerly used in the series. It also expands the character roster, re-grouping the playable characters into three-member teams as in the prior installments. The ports are notable for including more content than the original version such as new characters, stages and game modes. Critical reception has been positive.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:The King of Fighters XIII gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot showing a fight in ''The King of Fighters XIII'', featuring Maxima fighting against Elisabeth Blanctorche]]\n\nThe game removes some of the [[gameplay]] system features used in the [[The King of Fighters XII|prior game]]: the Guard Attack, the Critical Counter, the Clash System, as well as the dynamic, zooming camera. In their place, three new features have been added. The first of the three is the new EX Mode, which convert each character's super moves into more powerful versions that allows one bar from the player's power gauge for EX Special Moves and two bars from the player's power gauge for EX Super Special Moves. Another new feature is the Hyper Drive mode, which gives the player unlimited use of Drive Cancels for a while once the Hyper Drive Gauge has been maxed, and the last new feature confirmed for the game is the Drive Cancel, which opens up new [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] possibilities. The game also marks the return of the multi-bar power gauge that was introduced in ''[[The King of Fighters '97]]''.<ref name=AshSaga/> In addition to standard and EX Desperation Moves, a new class of Desperation Move called Neo Max is included in the game and require that three stocks of gauge be exchanged to perform one, making it similar to Hidden Super Desperation Moves from ''[[The King of Fighters 2002]]'' and Leader Super Special Moves from ''[[The King of Fighters 2003]]''. These can also be cancelled from standard Desperation Moves, making them similar to the Dream Cancels from ''[[The King of Fighters XI]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/kof-xiii/system/neomax.html|publisher=SNK Playmore|title=Neo Max\u8d85\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280 \uff06 Max\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb The King of Fighters XIII|accessdate=April 24, 2010|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053313/http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/kof-xiii/system/neomax.html|archivedate=April 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe console version is based on the 1.1 update of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' arcade which fixed several issues from the original version.<ref name=\"e3prev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/the-king-of-fighters-xiii/preview_6318806.html|website=GameSpot|title=E3 2011: The King of Fighters XIII Hands-On Preview&nbsp;\u2013 Early Details|author=Park, Andrew|accessdate=June 9, 2011|date=August 3, 2011}}</ref> It also contains a story mode that influenced by the player's actions with various perspectives being available.

Saiki intends to use the energy expended by the winning team to enable him to cross time. However, as the fight rages, Botan notes that the gate that links them to the past is starting to close despite the battle. Before Saiki can act, he is ambushed by Ash Crimson, who steals his power. It is revealed then that, while Ash was enlisted by Saiki to obtain the Three Sacred Treasures to power the time gate, Ash had no intention of helping Saiki. Ash is suddenly overtaken by Saiki's persona, who then attempts to cross the time gate in Ash's body. The winning team pursues him into the time gate and the final battle of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' begins inside the time gate. Saiki is defeated in the gate but persists on crossing over to the past, believing it means nothing since he can return to the past and then cross the gate again to attempt his plan anew. However, Ash halts his attempt and allows the gate to close, leaving Saiki trapped in the present. Furthermore, Ash reveals that he is a descendant of Saiki. By locking Saiki out of the gate, he denies Saiki's existence in the past and forces his own existence to cease. As Ash vanishes from the living world, the flow of time resumes. In the epilogue of the Story Mode, in the dimensional rift, a spear appeared in front of Shroom and Rimelo, two members of Those From The Past who faced Kyo in the opening of the game (Console version). More surprising, Shion appeared before them, revealed that he's still alive.\n\n==Characters==\n{{further|List of The King of Fighters characters}}\n\nThe roster of ''The King of Fighters XIII'' features all the characters who appeared in ''[[The King of Fighters XII]]'', including the two console-exclusive characters, Elisabeth Branctorche and Mature.

He is chiefly remembered for his role as the last commander of [[Nazi-occupied Paris]] in 1944, when he disobeyed [[Adolf Hitler]]'s orders to level the city, but instead surrendered it to [[Free France|Free French forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/paris-liberated |title=Paris liberated - Aug 25, 1944 - HISTORY.com |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-the-liberation-of-paris.htm |title=World War II: The Liberation of Paris - HistoryNet |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref> He has been called the \"'''Saviour of Paris'''\" for preventing its destruction. Choltitz later asserted that his defiance of Hitler's direct order stemmed from its obvious military futility, his affection for the French capital's history and culture, and his belief that Hitler had by then become insane.\n\n== Early life ==\nCholtitz was born in the castle in Gr\u00e4flich Wiese (now [[\u0141\u0105ka Prudnicka]], [[Poland]]), near Neustadt in Oberschlesien (now [[Prudnik]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lernzeit.de/paris-sommer-44/ |title=Paris - Sommer 44 |date=6 April 2018 |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> in the [[province of Silesia]] as a son of Hans von Choltitz (1865\u20131935), who was a [[major]] of the [[Prussian Army]], and his German wife Gertrud von Rosenberg. His uncle Hermann von Choltitz was a governor of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. from 1907 to 1920.\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1907 Dietrich von Choltitz enrolled in the [[Dresden]] [[Cadet Corps|Cadet School]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpLfa-OjX9EC&pg=PT135&lpg=PT135&source=bl&ots=tJEZogVLjV&sig=QbKlPGRLtDWdqOklQOkokv6Y6so&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBjcjJq83fAhVIbVAKHaYgBbkQ6AEwC3oECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Defenders of Fortress Europe: The Untold Story of the German Officers During the Allied Invasion |last=Mitcham |first=Samuel W. | authorlink = Samuel W.

The couple had two daughters, Maria Angelika (born 1930) and Anna Barbara (born 1936), and a son, Timo (born 1944).\n\nHe remained in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' during the [[Weimar Republic]], becoming a [[cavalry]] [[Captain (land)|captain]] in 1929. Promoted to [[Major (Germany)|Major]] in 1937, he was made commander of third battalion, ''Infanterie-Regiment 16 \"Oldenburg\"'', a part of [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22. Luftlande-Division]]. In 1938 he was promoted again, this time to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]''.\n\nHe participated in the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Sudetenland]] in 1938 and in the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, where he fought under [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and the river [[Bzura]].\n\nIn May of 1940, Choltitz participated in the [[Battle of Rotterdam]], making an air landing and seizing some of the city's key bridges. After the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombardment of Rotterdam]], during a meeting with the Dutch discussing the terms of surrender of all Dutch forces in Rotterdam, the German ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Kurt Student]] was shot in the head. Student was very popular with his troops and when the German forces moved to execute surrendering Dutch officers in reprisal Choltitz intervened and was able to prevent the massacre. His actions during the assault on Rotterdam earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. In September of the same year, he was given command of the regiment, and the following spring was made [[Oberst]].\n\nAt the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], Choltitz's regiment was based in Romania, advancing as part of [[Army Group South]] into Ukraine. As part of [[Erich von Manstein]]'s 11th Army, the regiment fought in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941\u201342)|siege of Sevastopol]]. The siege was bloody for his regiment, which was reduced from 4,800 men to just 349; Choltitz was also wounded in the arm. Promoted to ''[[Generalmajor]]'' soon after, he was made acting commander of 260th Infantry division in 1942. He was then promoted to ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' the following year and given command of [[11th Panzer Division]], which he led during the [[Battle of Kursk]].\n\nIn March 1944, Choltitz was transferred to the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian theatre of operations]], where he was made deputy commander of [[LXXVI Panzer Corps]] and participated in the [[Battle of Anzio]]. Transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] in June 1944, he took command of LXXXIV Army Corps, which he commanded against the [[Operation Overlord|Allied breakout from Normandy]].\n\n== Governor of Paris ==\n{{Further|Liberation of Paris#German surrender (25 August)}}\nOn 1 August 1944, Choltitz was promoted to [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|''General der Infanterie'']], and on 7 August was appointed the [[Wehrmachtbefehlshaber|military governor]] of Paris. At a meeting in Germany the following day, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] instructed him to be prepared to leave no Parisian religious building or historical monument standing. After Choltitz's arrival in Paris on 9 August, Hitler confirmed the order by cable: \"The city must not fall into the enemy's hand except lying in complete rubble.\"<ref name = \"telegraph\">Randall, C (24 August 2004).

Choltitz later was transferred to [[Camp Clinton]] in [[Mississippi]].  No specific charges were ever filed against him, and he was released from captivity in 1947.  In 1956 he visited his wartime headquarters at the [[H\u00f4tel Meurice]] in Paris. Reportedly the long-time head barman of the hotel recognized the short, rotund man with \"impossibly correct posture\" wandering around the bar as if in a daze. After the manager of the hotel met him in the bar, he asked to see his old room.

Choltitz later asserted that his defiance of Hitler's direct order stemmed from its obvious military futility, his affection for the French capital's history and culture, and his belief that Hitler had by then become insane.\n\n== Early life ==\nCholtitz was born in the castle in Gr\u00e4flich Wiese (now [[\u0141\u0105ka Prudnicka]], [[Poland]]), near Neustadt in Oberschlesien (now [[Prudnik]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lernzeit.de/paris-sommer-44/ |title=Paris - Sommer 44 |date=6 April 2018 |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> in the [[province of Silesia]] as a son of Hans von Choltitz (1865\u20131935), who was a [[major]] of the [[Prussian Army]], and his German wife Gertrud von Rosenberg.

The couple had two daughters, Maria Angelika (born 1930) and Anna Barbara (born 1936), and a son, Timo (born 1944).\n\nHe remained in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' during the [[Weimar Republic]], becoming a [[cavalry]] [[Captain (land)|captain]] in 1929. Promoted to [[Major (Germany)|Major]] in 1937, he was made commander of third battalion, ''Infanterie-Regiment 16 \"Oldenburg\"'', a part of [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22. Luftlande-Division]]. In 1938 he was promoted again, this time to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]''.\n\nHe participated in the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Sudetenland]] in 1938 and in the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, where he fought under [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and the river [[Bzura]].\n\nIn May of 1940, Choltitz participated in the [[Battle of Rotterdam]], making an air landing and seizing some of the city's key bridges. After the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombardment of Rotterdam]], during a meeting with the Dutch discussing the terms of surrender of all Dutch forces in Rotterdam, the German ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Kurt Student]] was shot in the head. Student was very popular with his troops and when the German forces moved to execute surrendering Dutch officers in reprisal Choltitz intervened and was able to prevent the massacre. His actions during the assault on Rotterdam earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. In September of the same year, he was given command of the regiment, and the following spring was made [[Oberst]].\n\nAt the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], Choltitz's regiment was based in Romania, advancing as part of [[Army Group South]] into Ukraine. As part of [[Erich von Manstein]]'s 11th Army, the regiment fought in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941\u201342)|siege of Sevastopol]]. The siege was bloody for his regiment, which was reduced from 4,800 men to just 349; Choltitz was also wounded in the arm. Promoted to ''[[Generalmajor]]'' soon after, he was made acting commander of 260th Infantry division in 1942. He was then promoted to ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' the following year and given command of [[11th Panzer Division]], which he led during the [[Battle of Kursk]].\n\nIn March 1944, Choltitz was transferred to the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian theatre of operations]], where he was made deputy commander of [[LXXVI Panzer Corps]] and participated in the [[Battle of Anzio]]. Transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] in June 1944, he took command of LXXXIV Army Corps, which he commanded against the [[Operation Overlord|Allied breakout from Normandy]].\n\n== Governor of Paris ==\n{{Further|Liberation of Paris#German surrender (25 August)}}\nOn 1 August 1944, Choltitz was promoted to [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|''General der Infanterie'']], and on 7 August was appointed the military governor of Paris. At a meeting in Germany the following day, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] instructed him to be prepared to leave no Parisian religious building or historical monument standing.

In 1956 he visited his wartime headquarters at the [[H\u00f4tel Meurice]] in Paris. Reportedly the long-time head barman of the hotel recognized the short, rotund man with \"impossibly correct posture\" wandering around the bar as if in a daze.
