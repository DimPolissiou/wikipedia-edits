Fothergill rewarded his bravery with 1,500 pounds, a British passport, and passage to Britain, where Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nHowever, the record of evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} Evidence indicates that Rosenblum arrived in London from France in December 1895, prompted by his unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money and a hasty departure from [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], a residential suburb of Paris.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} According to this account, Rosenblum and his Polish accomplice Yan Voitek waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist's throat was cut; the other was named Constant Della Cassa, who died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} The French newspaper ''L'Union R\u00e9publicaine de Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire'' reported the incident on 27 December 1895:\n{{quote|{{resize|90%|A dramatic event occurred on a train between Paris and Fontainebleau\u2026.

Terrified at the sight, the station staff hastened to inform the special investigator who started preliminary enquiries and sent the wounded man to the hospital in Fontainebleau.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=56}}}}}}\n\nPolice learned that the physical description of one assailant matched Rosenblum's, but he was already en route to Britain. His accomplice Voitek later told British intelligence officers about this incident and other dealings with Rosenblum.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} Several months prior to this murder, Rosenblum had met [[Ethel Voynich|Ethel Lilian Boole]], a young Englishwoman{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=274\u2013276}}{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=27}} who was a budding writer and active in Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles.

After the affair concluded, they continued to correspond.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=27}} In 1897, Boole published ''[[The Gadfly]]'', a critically acclaimed novel whose central character was allegedly based on Reilly's life as Rosenblum.{{sfn|Ramm|2017}} In the novel, the protagonist is a bastard who feigns his suicide to escape his illegitimate past, and then voyages to South America.

(Melville later oversaw a special section of the British Secret Service Bureau founded in 1909.){{sfn|SIS Website|2007}}{{sfn|Andrew|2009|p=81}}\n\nIn 1897, Rosenblum began an affair with Margaret Thomas (n\u00e9e Callaghan), the youthful wife of Reverend Hugh Thomas, shortly before her husband's death.{{sfn|Spence|2002|pp=28\u201339}}{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|pp=29\u201330}} Rosenblum met Thomas in London through his Ozone Preparations Company{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=24}} because Thomas had a kidney inflammation and was intrigued by the miracle cures peddled by Rosenblum. Thomas introduced Rosenblum to his wife at his manor house, and they began having an affair. On 4 March 1898, Thomas altered his will and appointed Margaret as an executrix; he was found dead in his room on 12 March 1898, just a week after the new will was made.{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=30}} A mysterious Dr. T. W. Andrew, whose physical description matched that of Rosenblum, appeared to certify Thomas's death as generic influenza and proclaimed that there was no need for an inquest.

Andrew in Great Britain circa 1897.{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nMargaret insisted that her husband's body be ready for burial 36 hours after his death.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=15\u201318}} She inherited roughly \u00a3800,000.

Both would eventually marry daughters of Henry Freeman Pannett, an associate of [[William Melville]]. The marriage not only brought the wealth which Rosenblum desired but provided a pretext to discard his identity of Sigmund Rosenblum; with Melville's assistance, he crafted a new identity: \"Sidney George Reilly\". This new identity was key to achieving his desire to return to the Russian Empire and voyage to the Far East.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=44}} Reilly \"obtained his new identity and nationality without taking any legal steps to change his name and without making an official application for British citizenship, all of which suggests some type of official intervention.\"{{sfn|Spence|1995|p=92}} This intervention likely occurred to facilitate his upcoming work in Russia on behalf of British intelligence.{{sfn|Spence|1995|p=92}}\n\n== Russia and the Far East ==\n{{Cquote|{{resize|90%|[Sidney Reilly's role] is one of the unsolved riddles about the Russo-Japanese War.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=56}}}}\n|author=[[Ian Nish|Ian H.

However, the stolen plans did not help the Japanese much. Despite ideal conditions for a surprise attack, their combat results were relatively poor.

On the other hand, his courage and indifference to danger were superb.\"{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} Throughout their backroom intrigues in Moscow, Lockhart never openly questioned Reilly's loyalty to the Allies, although he privately wondered if Reilly had made a secret bargain with Colonel Berzin and his Latvian Riflemen to later seize power for themselves.{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} \n\nIn Lockhart's estimation, Reilly was a limitless \"man cast in the Napoleonic mold\" and, if their counter-revolutionary coup had succeeded, \"the prospect of playing a lone hand [using Berzin's Latvian Riflemen] may have inspired him with a Napoleonic design\" to become the head of any new government.{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} However, unbeknownst to the Allied conspirators, Berzin was \"an honest commander\" and \"devoted to the Soviet government\".{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}} Although not a Chekist, he nonetheless informed Dzerzhinsky's Cheka that he had been approached by Reilly and that Allied agents had attempted to recruit him into a possible coup.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}} This information did not surprise Dzerzhinsky as the Cheka had gained access to the British diplomatic codes in May and were closely monitoring the anti-Bolshevik activities.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1230}} Dzerzhinsky instructed Berzin and other Latvian officers to pretend to be receptive to the Allied plotters and to meticuously report on every detail of their pending operation.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}}\n\n=== The Plot Unravels ===\n{{Further|North Russia Intervention}}\nWhile Allied agents militated against the Soviet regime in Petrograd and Moscow, persistent rumors swirled of an impending Allied military intervention in Russia which would overthrow the fledgling Soviet government in favor of a new regime willing to rejoin the ongoing war against the Central Powers.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1225}} On 4 August 1918, an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied force]] landed at [[Arkhangelsk]], Russia, beginning a famous military expedition dubbed [[Archangel (operation)|Operation Archangel]]. Its professed objective was to prevent the German Empire from obtaining Allied military supplies stored in the region. In retaliation for this incursion, the Bolsheviks raided the British [[diplomatic mission]] on 5 August, disrupting a meeting Reilly had arranged between the anti-Bolshevik Latvians, UDMF officials, and Lockhart.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=166\u2013169}} Unperturbed by these raids, Reilly conducted meetings on 17 August 1918 between Latvian regimental leaders and liaised with Captain [[George Alexander Hill]], a multilingual British agent operating in Russia on behalf of the Military Intelligence Directorate.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|p=1448}}{{sfn|Kitchen|ps=: \"Hill, George Alexander (1892\u20131968).

Poole's American Consulate in Moscow.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1225}} By this time, the Allied conspirators had organized a broad network of agents and saboteurs throughout Soviet Russia whose overarching ambition was to disrupt the nation's food supplies. Coupled with the planned military uprising in Moscow, they believed a chronic food shortage would trigger popular unrest and further undermine the Soviet authorities. In turn, the Soviets would be overthrown by a new government friendly to the Allied Powers which would renew hostilities against [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II's]] [[German Empire|German Reich]].{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1226}} On 28 August, Reilly informed Hill that he was immediately leaving Moscow for Petrograd where he would discuss final details related to the coup with Commander Francis Cromie at the British consulate.{{sfn|Hill|1932|p=239}} That night, Reilly had no difficulty in traveling through picket lines between Moscow and Petrograd due to his identification as a member of the Petrograd Cheka and his possession of Cheka travel permits.{{sfn|Hill|1932|p=239}}\n\nOn 30 August, [[Boris Savinkov]] and Maximilian Filonenko ordered a military cadet named [[Leonid Kannegisser]]\u2014Filonenko's cousin\u2014to shoot and kill [[Moisei Uritsky]], head of the [[Petrograd]] [[Cheka]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=317\u2013318}} Uritsky had been the second most powerful man in the city after [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the leader of the Petrograd Soviet, and his murder was seen as a blow to both the Cheka and the entire Bolshevik leadership.{{sfn|Ferguson|2010|pp=1\u20135|loc=Prologue}} After killing Uritsky, a panicked Kannegisser sought refuge either at the English Club{{sfn|Ferguson|2010|pp=1\u20135|loc=Prologue}} or at the British mission where Cromie resided and where Savinkov and Filonenko may have been temporarily in hiding.{{sfn|Brooklyn Eagle|1918}}{{sfn|Washington Post|1918}} Regardless of whether he fled to the English Club or to the British consulate, Kannegisser was compelled to leave the premises.

using their network of British agents for safe houses and assistance.{{sfn|Hill|1932|pp=244\u2013245}} However, Reilly instead chose a shorter, more dangerous route north through Petrograd and the Baltic Provinces to Finland to get their reports to London as early as possible.{{sfn|Hill|1932|pp=244\u2013245}} With the Cheka closing in, Reilly, carrying a [[Baltic German]] passport supplied by Hill, posed as a legation secretary and departed the region in a railway car reserved for the German Embassy.

Their assignment was to uncover information about the [[Black Sea]] coast needed for the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]].{{sfn|Spence|2002|pp=247\u2013251}} At that time, the region was home to a variety of anti-Bolsheviks. They travelled in the guise of British merchants, with appropriate credentials provided by the Department of Overseas Trade. Over the next six weeks or so, Reilly prepared twelve dispatches which reported on various aspects of the situation in South Russia and were delivered personally by Hill to the Foreign Office in London. \n\nReilly identified four principal factors in the affairs of South Russia at this time: the Volunteer Army; the territorial or provincial governments in the Kuban, Don, and Crimea; the Petlyura movement in Ukraine; and the economic situation. In his opinion, the future course of events in this region would depend not only on the interaction of these factors with each other, but \"above all upon Allied attitude towards them\". Reilly advocated Allied assistance to organise South Russia into a suitable ''place d'armes'' for decisive advance against Petlurism and Bolshevism. In his opinion: \"The military Allied assistance required for this would be comparatively small as proved by recent events in Odessa. Landing parties in the ports and detachments assisting Volunteer Army on lines of communication would probably be sufficient.\"{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\nReilly's reference to events in Odessa concerned the successful landing there on 18 December 1918 of troops from the French 156th Division commanded by General Borius, who managed to wrest control of the city from the Petlyurists with the assistance of a small contingent of Volunteers.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\nUrgent as the need for Allied military assistance to the Volunteer Army was in Reilly's estimation, he regarded economic assistance for South Russia as \"even more pressing\". Manufactured goods were so scarce in this region that he considered any moderate contribution from the Allies would have a most beneficial effect. Otherwise, apart from echoing a certain General Poole's suggestion for a British or Anglo-French Commission to control merchant shipping engaged in trading activities in the Black Sea, Reilly did not offer any solutions to what he called a state of 'general economic chaos' in South Russia. Reilly found White officials, who had been given the job of helping the Russian economy get better, \"helpless\" in coming to terms with \"the colossal disaster which has overtaken Russia's finances, ... and unable to frame anything, approaching even an outline, of a financial policy\". But he supported their request for the Allies to print \"500 Million roubles of Nicholas money of all denominations' for the Special Council as a matter of urgency, with the justification that 'although one realizes the fundamental futility of this remedy, one must agree with them that for the moment this is the only remedy\". Lack of funds was one reason offered by Reilly to explain the Whites' blatant inactivity in the propaganda field. They were also said to be lacking paper and printing presses needed for the preparation of propaganda material. Reilly claimed that the Special Council had come to appreciate fully the benefits of propaganda.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\n=== Final Marriage ===\nWhile on a visit to postwar Berlin in December 1922, Reilly met a charming young actress named Pepita Bobadilla in the [[Hotel Adlon]]. Bobadilla was an attractive blonde who falsely claimed to be from South America.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=111}} Her real name was Nelly Burton, and she was the widow of [[Charles Haddon Chambers]],{{sfn|New York Times|1925}} a well-known British playwright. For the past several years, Bobadilla had gained notoriety both as Chambers' wife and for her stage career as a dancer.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=111}} On 18 May 1923, after a whirlwind romance, Bobadilla married Reilly at a civil Registry Office on Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden, Central London, with [[George Alexander Hill|Captain Hill]] acting as a witness.{{sfn|Bobadilla|Reilly|1931|p=110}}{{sfn|New York Times|1933}} As Reilly was already married at the time, their union was bigamous.

Like Fleming's fictional creation, Reilly was multi-lingual, fascinated by the Far East, fond of fine living, and a compulsive gambler.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=12}} When queried on whether Reilly's colorful life had directly inspired Bond, Ian Fleming replied: \"James Bond is just a piece of nonsense I dreamed up.

The memoirs retold the efforts by Reilly, Lockhart, and other conspirators to sabotage the Bolshevik revolution while still in its infancy.\n\nThe world press made Reilly into a household name within five years of his execution by Soviet agents in 1925, lauding him as a peerless spy and recounting his many espionage adventures. Newspapers dubbed him \"the greatest spy in history\" and \"the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]] of Red Russia\".{{sfn|Billington|1984}} The London ''Evening Standard'' described his exploits in an illustrated serial in May 1931 headlined \"Master Spy\". [[Ian Fleming]] used him as a model for [[Inspirations for James Bond|James Bond]] in his novels (set in the early [[Cold War]]).{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=118,132}} Reilly is considered to be \"the dominating figure in the mythology of modern British espionage\".{{sfn|Andrew|1986|p=83}}\n\n== Birth and youth ==\nThe true details about Reilly's origin, identity, and exploits have eluded researchers and intelligence agencies for more than a century.

According to a Soviet secret police dossier compiled in 1925,{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=2}} he was perhaps born Zigmund Markovich Rozenblum on 24 March 1874 in [[Odessa]],{{efn|name=Birth Year|Reilly's birth year is disputed.

His father was known locally as George rather than Gregory, hence Sigmund's patronymic Georgievich.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|p=1447}} The family seems to have been well-connected in Polish nationalist circles through Pauline's intimate friendship with [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], the Polish statesman who became Prime Minister of Poland and also Poland's foreign minister in 1919.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|p=1447}}\n\n== Travels abroad ==\n{{CSS image crop|Image = Voynich_Ethel_Lilian.jpg|bSize = 220|cWidth = 150|cHeight = 150|oTop = 30|oLeft = 35|Location = right|Description = [[Ethel Voynich]], n\u00e9e Boole.

He escaped judicial punishment, and he later was friends with Okhrana agents such as Alexander Nikolaev Grammatikov,{{sfn|Elwood|1986|p=310}} and these details might indicate that he was a police informant even at this young age.{{efn|name=Okhrana Recruit|Switching one's political allegiances from anti-Tsarist revolutionary activist to pro-Tsarist police informant as a result of Okhrana blackmail was quite frequent in the final decade of the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Elwood|1986|p=310}}  For examples of Okhrana informants similar to Sidney Reilly and Alexander Grammatikov, see R.

Fothergill rewarded his bravery with 1,500 pounds, a British passport, and passage to Britain, where Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nHowever, the record of evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} Evidence indicates that Rosenblum arrived in London from France in December 1895, prompted by his unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money and a hasty departure from [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], a residential suburb of Paris.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} According to this account, Rosenblum and his Polish accomplice Yan Voitek waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist's throat was cut; the other was named Constant Della Cassa, who died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} The French newspaper ''L'Union R\u00e9publicaine de Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire'' reported the incident on 27 December 1895:\n{{quote|{{resize|90%|A dramatic event occurred on a train between Paris and Fontainebleau\u2026.

Terrified at the sight, the station staff hastened to inform the special investigator who started preliminary enquiries and sent the wounded man to the hospital in Fontainebleau.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=56}}}}}}\n\nPolice learned that the physical description of one assailant matched Rosenblum's, but he was already en route to Britain. His accomplice Voitek later told British intelligence officers about this incident and other dealings with Rosenblum.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=32\u201333}} Several months prior to this murder, Rosenblum had met [[Ethel Voynich|Ethel Lilian Boole]], a young Englishwoman{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=274\u2013276}}{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=27}} who was a budding writer and active in Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles. The couple developed a rapport and began a sexual liaison,{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=274\u201376}} and he told her about his past in Russia. After the affair concluded, they continued to correspond.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=27}} In 1897, Boole published ''[[The Gadfly]]'', a critically acclaimed novel whose central character was allegedly based on Reilly's life as Rosenblum.{{sfn|Ramm|2017}} In the novel, the protagonist is a bastard who feigns his suicide to escape his illegitimate past, and then voyages to South America. He later returns to Europe and becomes involved with Italian anarchists and other revolutionaries.{{sfn|Ramm|2017}}\n\nFor decades, certain biographers had dismissed the Reilly-Boole liaison as unsubstantiated.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} However, evidence was found in 2016 among archived correspondence in the extended Boole-Hinton family confirming that a relationship transpired between Reilly and Boole around 1895 in Florence.{{sfn|Kennedy|2016|pp=274\u201376}} There is some question of whether he was truly smitten with Boole and sincerely returned her affections, as he might have been a paid police informant reporting on her activities and those of other radicals.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}}\n\n==In London: 1890s==\n{{CSS image crop|Image = Williammelville.jpg|bSize = 175|cWidth = 150|cHeight = 150|oTop = 15|oLeft = 15|Location = right|Description = [[William Melville]] purportedly created the cover identity of Sidney Reilly for Rosenblum.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=44}}|Link = William Melville}}\nReilly continued to go by the name Rosenblum, living at the Albert Mansions, an apartment block in Rosetta Street, Waterloo, London in early 1896.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=34}} He created the Ozone Preparations Company, which peddled patent medicines,{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=34}} and he became a paid informant for the \u00e9migr\u00e9 intelligence network of [[William Melville]], superintendent of Scotland Yard's [[Special Branch]]. (Melville later oversaw a special section of the British Secret Service Bureau founded in 1909.){{sfn|SIS Website|2007}}{{sfn|Andrew|2009|p=81}}\n\nIn 1897, Rosenblum began an affair with Margaret Thomas (n\u00e9e Callaghan), the youthful wife of Reverend Hugh Thomas, shortly before her husband's death.{{sfn|Spence|2002|pp=28\u201339}}{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|pp=29\u201330}} Rosenblum met Thomas in London through his Ozone Preparations Company{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=24}} because Thomas had a kidney inflammation and was intrigued by the miracle cures peddled by Rosenblum. Thomas introduced Rosenblum to his wife at his manor house, and they began having an affair. On 4 March 1898, Thomas altered his will and appointed Margaret as an executrix; he was found dead in his room on 12 March 1898, just a week after the new will was made.{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=30}} A mysterious Dr. T. W. Andrew, whose physical description matched that of Rosenblum, appeared to certify Thomas's death as generic influenza and proclaimed that there was no need for an inquest. Records indicate that there was no one by the name of Dr. T. W. Andrew in Great Britain circa 1897.{{sfn|Spence|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nMargaret insisted that her husband's body be ready for burial 36 hours after his death.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=15\u201318}} She inherited roughly \u00a3800,000. The [[Metropolitan Police]] did not investigate Dr. T. W.

Both would eventually marry daughters of Henry Freeman Pannett, an associate of [[William Melville]]. The marriage not only brought the wealth which Rosenblum desired but provided a pretext to discard his identity of Sigmund Rosenblum; with Melville's assistance, he crafted a new identity: \"Sidney George Reilly\". This new identity was key to achieving his desire to return to the Russian Empire and voyage to the Far East.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=44}} Reilly \"obtained his new identity and nationality without taking any legal steps to change his name and without making an official application for British citizenship, all of which suggests some type of official intervention.\"{{sfn|Spence|1995|p=92}} This intervention likely occurred to facilitate his upcoming work in Russia on behalf of British intelligence.{{sfn|Spence|1995|p=92}}\n\n== Russia and the Far East ==\n{{Cquote|{{resize|90%|[Sidney Reilly's role] is one of the unsolved riddles about the Russo-Japanese War.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=56}}}}\n|author=[[Ian Nish|Ian H.

On the other hand, his courage and indifference to danger were superb.\"{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} Throughout their backroom intrigues in Moscow, Lockhart never openly questioned Reilly's loyalty to the Allies, although he privately wondered if Reilly had made a secret bargain with Colonel Berzin and his Latvian Riflemen to later seize power for themselves.{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} \n\nIn Lockhart's estimation, Reilly was a limitless \"man cast in the Napoleonic mold\" and, if their counter-revolutionary coup had succeeded, \"the prospect of playing a lone hand [using Berzin's Latvian Riflemen] may have inspired him with a Napoleonic design\" to become the head of any new government.{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=277, 322\u2013323}} However, unbeknownst to the Allied conspirators, Berzin was \"an honest commander\" and \"devoted to the Soviet government\".{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}} Although not a Chekist, he nonetheless informed Dzerzhinsky's Cheka that he had been approached by Reilly and that Allied agents had attempted to recruit him into a possible coup.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}} This information did not surprise Dzerzhinsky as the Cheka had gained access to the British diplomatic codes in May and were closely monitoring the anti-Bolshevik activities.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1230}} Dzerzhinsky instructed Berzin and other Latvian officers to pretend to be receptive to the Allied plotters and to meticuously report on every detail of their pending operation.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1231}}\n\n=== The Plot Unravels ===\n{{Further|North Russia Intervention}}\nWhile Allied agents militated against the Soviet regime in Petrograd and Moscow, persistent rumors swirled of an impending Allied military intervention in Russia which would overthrow the fledgling Soviet government in favor of a new regime willing to rejoin the ongoing war against the Central Powers.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1225}} On 4 August 1918, an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied force]] landed at [[Arkhangelsk]], Russia, beginning a famous military expedition dubbed [[Archangel (operation)|Operation Archangel]]. Its professed objective was to prevent the German Empire from obtaining Allied military supplies stored in the region. In retaliation for this incursion, the Bolsheviks raided the British [[diplomatic mission]] on 5 August, disrupting a meeting Reilly had arranged between the anti-Bolshevik Latvians, UDMF officials, and Lockhart.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=166\u2013169}} Unperturbed by these raids, Reilly conducted meetings on 17 August 1918 between Latvian regimental leaders and liaised with Captain [[George Alexander Hill]], a multilingual British agent operating in Russia on behalf of the Military Intelligence Directorate.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|p=1448}}{{sfn|Kitchen|ps=: \"Hill, George Alexander (1892\u20131968).

Poole's American Consulate in Moscow.{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1225}} By this time, the Allied conspirators had organized a broad network of agents and saboteurs throughout Soviet Russia whose overarching ambition was to disrupt the nation's food supplies. Coupled with the planned military uprising in Moscow, they believed a chronic food shortage would trigger popular unrest and further undermine the Soviet authorities. In turn, the Soviets would be overthrown by a new government friendly to the Allied Powers which would renew hostilities against [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II's]] [[German Empire|German Reich]].{{sfn|Long|1995|p=1226}} On 28 August, Reilly informed Hill that he was immediately leaving Moscow for Petrograd where he would discuss final details related to the coup with Commander Francis Cromie at the British consulate.{{sfn|Hill|1932|p=239}} That night, Reilly had no difficulty in traveling through picket lines between Moscow and Petrograd due to his identification as a member of the Petrograd Cheka and his possession of Cheka travel permits.{{sfn|Hill|1932|p=239}}\n\nOn 30 August, [[Boris Savinkov]] and Maximilian Filonenko ordered a military cadet named [[Leonid Kannegisser]]\u2014Filonenko's cousin\u2014to shoot and kill [[Moisei Uritsky]], head of the [[Petrograd]] [[Cheka]].{{sfn|Lockhart|1932|pp=317\u2013318}} Uritsky had been the second most powerful man in the city after [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the leader of the Petrograd Soviet, and his murder was seen as a blow to both the Cheka and the entire Bolshevik leadership.{{sfn|Ferguson|2010|pp=1\u20135|loc=Prologue}} After killing Uritsky, a panicked Kannegisser sought refuge either at the English Club{{sfn|Ferguson|2010|pp=1\u20135|loc=Prologue}} or at the British mission where Cromie resided and where Savinkov and Filonenko may have been temporarily in hiding.{{sfn|Brooklyn Eagle|1918}}{{sfn|Washington Post|1918}} Regardless of whether he fled to the English Club or to the British consulate, Kannegisser was compelled to leave the premises.

using their network of British agents for safe houses and assistance.{{sfn|Hill|1932|pp=244\u2013245}} However, Reilly instead chose a shorter, more dangerous route north through Petrograd and the Baltic Provinces to Finland to get their reports to London as early as possible.{{sfn|Hill|1932|pp=244\u2013245}} With the Cheka closing in, Reilly, carrying a [[Baltic German]] passport supplied by Hill, posed as a legation secretary and departed the region in a railway car reserved for the German Embassy.

Their assignment was to uncover information about the [[Black Sea]] coast needed for the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]].{{sfn|Spence|2002|pp=247\u2013251}} At that time, the region was home to a variety of anti-Bolsheviks. They travelled in the guise of British merchants, with appropriate credentials provided by the Department of Overseas Trade. Over the next six weeks or so, Reilly prepared twelve dispatches which reported on various aspects of the situation in South Russia and were delivered personally by Hill to the Foreign Office in London. \n\nReilly identified four principal factors in the affairs of South Russia at this time: the Volunteer Army; the territorial or provincial governments in the Kuban, Don, and Crimea; the Petlyura movement in Ukraine; and the economic situation. In his opinion, the future course of events in this region would depend not only on the interaction of these factors with each other, but \"above all upon Allied attitude towards them\". Reilly advocated Allied assistance to organise South Russia into a suitable ''place d'armes'' for decisive advance against Petlurism and Bolshevism. In his opinion: \"The military Allied assistance required for this would be comparatively small as proved by recent events in Odessa. Landing parties in the ports and detachments assisting Volunteer Army on lines of communication would probably be sufficient.\"{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\nReilly's reference to events in Odessa concerned the successful landing there on 18 December 1918 of troops from the French 156th Division commanded by General Borius, who managed to wrest control of the city from the Petlyurists with the assistance of a small contingent of Volunteers.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\nUrgent as the need for Allied military assistance to the Volunteer Army was in Reilly's estimation, he regarded economic assistance for South Russia as \"even more pressing\". Manufactured goods were so scarce in this region that he considered any moderate contribution from the Allies would have a most beneficial effect. Otherwise, apart from echoing a certain General Poole's suggestion for a British or Anglo-French Commission to control merchant shipping engaged in trading activities in the Black Sea, Reilly did not offer any solutions to what he called a state of 'general economic chaos' in South Russia. Reilly found White officials, who had been given the job of helping the Russian economy get better, \"helpless\" in coming to terms with \"the colossal disaster which has overtaken Russia's finances, ... and unable to frame anything, approaching even an outline, of a financial policy\". But he supported their request for the Allies to print \"500 Million roubles of Nicholas money of all denominations' for the Special Council as a matter of urgency, with the justification that 'although one realizes the fundamental futility of this remedy, one must agree with them that for the moment this is the only remedy\". Lack of funds was one reason offered by Reilly to explain the Whites' blatant inactivity in the propaganda field. They were also said to be lacking paper and printing presses needed for the preparation of propaganda material. Reilly claimed that the Special Council had come to appreciate fully the benefits of propaganda.{{sfn|Ainsworth|1998|pp=1447\u20131470}}\n\n=== Final Marriage ===\nWhile on a visit to postwar Berlin in December 1922, Reilly met a charming young actress named Pepita Bobadilla in the [[Hotel Adlon]]. Bobadilla was an attractive blonde who falsely claimed to be from South America.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=111}} Her real name was Nelly Burton, and she was the widow of [[Charles Haddon Chambers]],{{sfn|New York Times|1925}} a well-known British playwright. For the past several years, Bobadilla had gained notoriety both as Chambers' wife and for her stage career as a dancer.{{sfn|Lockhart|1967|p=111}} On 18 May 1923, after a whirlwind romance, Bobadilla married Reilly at a civil Registry Office on Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden, Central London, with [[George Alexander Hill|Captain Hill]] acting as a witness.{{sfn|Bobadilla|Reilly|1931|p=110}}{{sfn|New York Times|1933}} As Reilly was already married at the time, their union was bigamous.

Like Fleming's fictional creation, Reilly was multi-lingual, fascinated by the Far East, fond of fine living, and a compulsive gambler.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=12}} When queried on whether Reilly's colorful life had directly inspired Bond, Ian Fleming replied: \"James Bond is just a piece of nonsense I dreamed up.
