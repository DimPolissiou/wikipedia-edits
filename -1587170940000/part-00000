In a career that has spanned over four decades, he has scored numerous classics including ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' (1994), ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' (1999), ''[[Angels in America]]'' (2003), the Pixar films ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), and all but one of the films of director [[Sam Mendes]] including ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999), ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002), the ''[[James Bond]]'' films ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), and the war film ''[[1917 (2019 film)|1917]]'' (2019).\n\nNewman has been nominated for fifteen [[Academy Awards]], tying him with fellow composer [[Alex North]] for the most nominations without a win. He has also been nominated for four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], and has won two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]], six [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] and an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]]. Newman was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2000 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music.<ref name=bmi>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233494 |title=Richard Kirk Award: Thomas Newman Fulfills the Promise of His Legacy |publisher=bmi.com |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> His achievements have contributed to the Newmans being the [[List of Academy Award-winning families#Extended family|most nominated Academy Award extended family]], with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.\n\n==Personal life==\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], California, Newman is the youngest son of Martha Louis Montgomery (1920\u20132005) and composer [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] (1900\u20131970), who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] nine times. He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in [[Hollywood]] that includes his father Alfred, brother [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]], sister [[Maria Newman]], uncles [[Lionel Newman]] and [[Emil Newman]], cousin [[Randy Newman]] (also known as a singer and songwriter), and his first cousin, once removed, [[Joey Newman]]. His paternal grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] immigrants,<ref name=MacDonald>MacDonald, Laurence E. ''The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History'', Scarecrow Press (2013)</ref> and his mother was from Mississippi.\n\nDuring their upbringing, Martha Newman took her sons to violin lessons in the San Fernando Valley every weekend.<ref name=lati /> Newman later studied composition and orchestration for two years at the [[University of Southern California]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/appendix/composers/N/ThomasNewman.html |title=OnMusic Dictionary |publisher=Music.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref> before transferring to [[Yale University]], where he graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1977 and a [[Master of Music]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://news.yale.edu/2010/03/01/yale-alumni-go-oscars |title=YaleNews &#124; Yale Alumni Go to the Oscars |publisher=News.yale.edu |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref> While at Yale, he met composer [[Stephen Sondheim]], who became an early mentor.<ref name=lati>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/03/local/la-me-newman3-2009dec03 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Martha |last=Groves |title=A member of a musical dynasty writes a postcard about the past |date=December 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nNewman and his wife, Ann Marie, have three children. They reside in the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\n==Career==\nAt first, Newman was more interested in musical theater than in film composition, working with Sondheim in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays.<ref name=newmans>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/22/entertainment/ca-31343/4 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Amy |last=Wallace |title=The Newman Conquests |date=March 22, 1998}}</ref> Lionel, who succeeded Alfred as music director for [[20th Century Fox]], gave Thomas his first scoring assignment on a 1979 episode of the series ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]''.<ref name=bmi /> In 1983, [[John Williams]], who was a friend of both Alfred and Lionel, invited Newman to work on ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', orchestrating the scene where [[Darth Vader]] dies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/17/449417429/composer-thomas-newman-teams-with-spielberg-for-bridge-of-spies|title=When John Williams Can't Go, Whom Does Spielberg Call?

Newman said that he thought \"it was a tough job, at first\" for requiring him to \"develop vocabularies and a sense of procedure\", only getting comfortable with writing scores \"and not fraudulent in my efforts\" after 8 years.<ref name=thomp>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/oscar-watch-skyfall-composer-thomas-newman?page=2#blogPostHeaderPanel |title=Oscar Watch: 'Skyfall' Builds Academy Support, Composer Thomas Newman Overdue for Oscar&#124;Thompson on Hollywood |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Newman composed the score to [[Martin Brest]]'s film ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''.\n\nIn 1994, he got his first Academy Award nominations with the scores to ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' and ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''.<ref name=newmans /> He also scored the film ''[[The War (1994 film)|The War]]''. In 1996, he scored [[Diane Keaton]]'s ''[[Unstrung Heroes]]'', receiving yet another Oscar nomination. In 1998, he scored [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' as well as ''[[Meet Joe Black]]''. In 1999, Newman composed the score to [[Sam Mendes]]' first feature film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', created using mainly percussion instruments. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the \"moral ambiguity\" of the script, saying \"It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that.\"<ref name=Variety>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Spotlight: Thomas Newman |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117761178/?refcatid=16&printerfriendly=true |accessdate=January 14, 2013 |newspaper=Variety |date=January 20, 2000}}</ref> This was his first collaboration with Mendes, and he would go on to score all of the director's subsequent films except for the comedy-drama ''[[Away We Go]]'', which featured songs instead of a score. He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to [[John Corigliano]] for ''[[The Red Violin]]''), he did receive a [[Grammy]] and a [[BAFTA]].\n\nHis critical and commercial success has continued in the following years with his scores for films such as ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', ''[[In the Bedroom]]'' and ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]''. He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002), ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), and ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004). However, he lost on each occasion to [[Elliot Goldenthal]] (for ''[[Frida]]''), [[Howard Shore]] (for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''), and [[Jan A. P. Kaczmarek]] (for ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'') respectively. He also scored the theme tune for the hit HBO American drama series, \"Six Feet Under\", released June 3rd, 2001. \n\nHe was again nominated for an Oscar for scoring [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[The Good German]]'' (2006). At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by [[Errol Morris]], who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times. Newman replied: \"No, I've failed seven but this will be my eighth\", and indeed, he again lost, this time to [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] for ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''.\n\nHis first score since ''[[The Good German]]'' was for the 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]]'', collaborating for the second time with director [[Andrew Stanton]] (with the first collaboration being ''Finding Nemo''). The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had ''Nemo''). Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for \"Down to Earth\", which he co-wrote with [[Peter Gabriel]]. He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, [[James Newton-Howard]] and [[Danny Elfman]], both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully. Newman lost both the score and song nominations to [[A R Rahman]] for his work on ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''. He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for \"Down to Earth\".\n\nIn 2008, Newman scored ''[[Towelhead (film)|Towelhead]]'' and Sam Mendes' ''[[Revolutionary Road]]'' and in 2009, he scored ''[[Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]]''. In 2011, he scored ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'', ''[[The Debt (2011 film)|The Debt]]'', ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'', and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Newman: \u2018Help,\u2019 \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 exhibit contrasting styles |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/newman-help-iron-lady-exhibit-contrasting-styles-1118047376/ |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |newspaper=Variety |date=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Newman scored ''[[The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]''. He also scored the 23rd James Bond movie ''[[Skyfall]]'', directed by his longtime collaborator Sam Mendes, which celebrates the film franchise's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas Newman to compose Skyfall score |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=9922 |publisher=MI6-HQ.com |date=January 4, 2012}}</ref> His work on this film earned him his eleventh Oscar nomination and a second BAFTA win.  During 2013, he scored Steven Soderbergh's [[Side Effects (2013 film)|''Side Effects'']] and ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]''.  The latter score was very well received by film music critics, earning Newman BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the second consecutive year, both of which he lost to [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] for ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]''.\n\nNewman's 2014 projects included ''[[The Judge (2014 film)|The Judge]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''. In 2015, he scored ''[[The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]'', marking the first time Newman has scored a sequel to a film he also wrote the score for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/28/thomas-newman-to-return-for-the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-2/|title=Thomas Newman to Return for \u2018The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2\u2019 -  Film Music Reporter|publisher=}}</ref> Also that year, Newman returned to score Sam Mendes' 24th James Bond movie ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', the sequel to ''Skyfall'' and collaborated with [[Steven Spielberg]] for ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'', marking Newman's first collaboration with Spielberg and the first film for Spielberg not to feature musical score from his long-time composer John Williams since 1985's ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]''. For his score on ''Bridge of Spies'', Newman garnered another Oscar and Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 2016, Newman scored the motion picture ''[[Passengers (2016 film)|Passengers]]'' starring [[Chris Pratt]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]], for which he received his 14th Oscar nomination.\n\nIn 2019, Newman reunited with Sam Mendes for his war film ''[[1917 (2019 film)|1917]]'' (in his 7th collaboration), for which Newman received his 6th BAFTA and 15th Oscar nominations.\n\nNewman likes to vary  the instrumentation in his scores, ranging from full orchestra to percussion-only music. He is also fond of incorporating unusual instruments such as the [[zither]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[psaltery]] and [[hammered dulcimer]],<ref name=bmi /> or unexpected sounds, like [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] chants and the chirping of [[cicada]]s. The composer declared that he has \"an interest in mundane experimentation.\"<ref name=newmans />\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n\n====1980s====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Director(s)\n! style=\"width:300px;\"| Studio(s)\n!

He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in [[Hollywood]] that includes his father Alfred, brother [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]], sister [[Maria Newman]], uncles [[Lionel Newman]] and [[Emil Newman]], cousin [[Randy Newman]] (also known as a singer and songwriter), and his first cousin, once removed, [[Joey Newman]]. His paternal grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] immigrants,<ref name=MacDonald>MacDonald, Laurence E.

In 1998, he scored [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' as well as ''[[Meet Joe Black]]''. In 1999, Newman composed the score to [[Sam Mendes]]' first feature film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', created using mainly percussion instruments. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the \"moral ambiguity\" of the script, saying \"It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that.\"<ref name=Variety>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Spotlight: Thomas Newman |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117761178/?refcatid=16&printerfriendly=true |accessdate=January 14, 2013 |newspaper=Variety |date=January 20, 2000}}</ref> This was his first collaboration with Mendes, and he would go on to score all of the director's subsequent films except for the comedy-drama ''[[Away We Go]]'', which featured songs instead of a score. He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to [[John Corigliano]] for ''[[The Red Violin]]''), he did receive a [[Grammy]] and a [[BAFTA]].\n\nHis critical and commercial success has continued in the following years with his scores for films such as ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', ''[[In the Bedroom]]'' and ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]''. He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002), ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), and ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004). However, he lost on each occasion to [[Elliot Goldenthal]] (for ''[[Frida]]''), [[Howard Shore]] (for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''), and [[Jan A. P. Kaczmarek]] (for ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'') respectively. He also scored the theme tune for the hit HBO American drama series, \"Six Feet Under\", released June 3rd, 2001. \n\nHe was again nominated for an Oscar for scoring [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[The Good German]]'' (2006). At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by [[Errol Morris]], who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times. Newman replied: \"No, I've failed seven but this will be my eighth\", and indeed, he again lost, this time to [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] for ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''.\n\nHis first score since ''[[The Good German]]'' was for the 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]]'', collaborating for the second time with director [[Andrew Stanton]] (with the first collaboration being ''Finding Nemo''). The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had ''Nemo''). Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for \"Down to Earth\", which he co-wrote with [[Peter Gabriel]]. He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, [[James Newton-Howard]] and [[Danny Elfman]], both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully. Newman lost both the score and song nominations to [[A R Rahman]] for his work on ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''. He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for \"Down to Earth\".\n\nIn 2008, Newman scored ''[[Towelhead (film)|Towelhead]]'' and Sam Mendes' ''[[Revolutionary Road]]'' and in 2009, he scored ''[[Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]]''. In 2011, he scored ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'', ''[[The Debt (2011 film)|The Debt]]'', ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'', and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Newman: \u2018Help,\u2019 \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 exhibit contrasting styles |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/newman-help-iron-lady-exhibit-contrasting-styles-1118047376/ |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |newspaper=Variety |date=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Newman scored ''[[The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]''. He also scored the 23rd James Bond movie ''[[Skyfall]]'', directed by his longtime collaborator Sam Mendes, which celebrates the film franchise's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas Newman to compose Skyfall score |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=9922 |publisher=MI6-HQ.com |date=January 4, 2012}}</ref> His work on this film earned him his eleventh Oscar nomination and a second BAFTA win.  During 2013, he scored Steven Soderbergh's [[Side Effects (2013 film)|''Side Effects'']] and ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]''.  The latter score was very well received by film music critics, earning Newman BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the second consecutive year, both of which he lost to [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] for ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]''.\n\nNewman's 2014 projects included ''[[The Judge (2014 film)|The Judge]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''. In 2015, he scored ''[[The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]'', marking the first time Newman has scored a sequel to a film he also wrote the score for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/28/thomas-newman-to-return-for-the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-2/|title=Thomas Newman to Return for \u2018The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2\u2019 -  Film Music Reporter|publisher=}}</ref> Also that year, Newman returned to score Sam Mendes' 24th James Bond movie ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', the sequel to ''Skyfall'' and collaborated with [[Steven Spielberg]] for ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'', marking Newman's first collaboration with Spielberg and the first film for Spielberg not to feature musical score from his long-time composer John Williams since 1985's ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]''. For his score on ''Bridge of Spies'', Newman garnered another Oscar and Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 2016, Newman scored the motion picture ''[[Passengers (2016 film)|Passengers]]'' starring [[Chris Pratt]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]], for which he received his 14th Oscar nomination.\n\nIn 2019, Newman reunited with Sam Mendes for his war film ''[[1917 (2019 film)|1917]]'' (in his 7th collaboration), for which Newman received his 6th BAFTA and 15th Oscar nominations.\n\nNewman likes to vary  the instrumentation in his scores, ranging from full orchestra to percussion-only music. He is also fond of incorporating unusual instruments such as the [[zither]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[psaltery]] and [[hammered dulcimer]],<ref name=bmi /> or unexpected sounds, like [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] chants and the chirping of [[cicada]]s.

It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point she runs over Audrey's foot while speeding off in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto a coastal research station, where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]), to give her a spot on the next shuttle to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.

It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point she runs over Audrey's foot while speeding off in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto a research station, where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]), to give her a spot on a shuttle to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.
