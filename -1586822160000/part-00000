Years before her debut in the music industry, she took part in the contest ''Zhas Kanat'', a national music festival which aimed to launch the careers of amateur and new singers. After her performance in the festival, well-known producer Bayan Esentayeva became interested in her voice. She was hailed for her powerful voice and her beauty. In late 2012, she released her first single \"S\u00fa\u0131emin deshi\" ({{lang-kk|\u0421\u04af\u0439\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043d \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0456}}), which was used as a song in the soundtrack of the movie \"\u01f4ashyq j\u00farek\" ({{lang-kk|\u0492\u0430\u0448\u044b\u049b \u0436\u04af\u0440\u0435\u043a}}, ''A cocktail with stars'') where she also had a role. The popularity of the film and the success of the song turned the young singer into a celebrity.\n\n=== With KeshYou ===\nIn 2013, she was included in the new lineup of KeshYou,<ref name=\"esc 2018\"/> a well-known band in Kazakhstan, which is also known for its almost constant lineup changes. Her first single with KeshYou was the song \"As\u0131qpa\", which was a smash hit in Kazakhstan, topping the airplay charts for months.\n\nZhanar became more popular than Aidana Medenova and Kamshat Joldibayeva, the other two vocals of KeshYou. Thanks to the enormous promotional effort by Bayan Esentayeva, the popularity of the band increased, producing many more hit singles including \"Qazaq qyzdary\" ({{lang-kk|\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u049b\u044b\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044b}}, ''Kazakh girls''). The band also participated in the [[Kazakhstan in the Turkvision Song Contest#2013|Kazakhstani national final]] for the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2013]] with the song \"Rizamyn\" ({{lang-kk|\u0420\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043d}}), which placed fourth,<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131309/http://artparovoz.com/9347|archivedate=2 April 2015|url=http://artparovoz.com/9347|title=\u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u00abRinGo\u00bb \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u00abTurkvizyon-2013\u00bb|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=22 December 2019|website=artparovoz.com|lang=ru|first=Anna|last=Darmodekhina}}</ref> and became another hit. During this part of her music career, Zhanar Dugalova combined her KeshYou trajectory with solo songs.\n\n=== Solo ===\nDugalova left KeshYou in 2014.<ref name=\"esc 2018\"/> She released more solo songs with the collaboration of her producer Bayan Esentayeva, increasing her popularity. Dugalova won the [[Kazakhstan in the Turkvision Song Contest 2014|Kazakhstani national final]] for the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2014]] with the song \"Izin k\u00f3rem\" ({{lang-kk|\u0406\u0437\u0456\u043d \u043a\u04e9\u0440\u0435\u043c}}), and went on to represent Kazakhstan in the contest in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], Russia. She qualified from the semi-final on 19 November 2014 and won the contest on 21 November 2014 with 225 points.<ref name=\"tsc 2014\">{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2014/11/21/turkvizyon14-kazakhstan-wins/|title=Turkvizyon'14: Kazakhstan Wins!|website=eurovoix.com|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=22 December 2019|first=Anthony|last=Granger}}</ref>\n\nHaving become a national heroine, Dugalova released more songs and took part in many national events. In 2015, the singer met then-President of Kazakhstan [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who invited her to a convention of Kazakhstani women in which other successful Kazakhstani personalities such as female volleyball player [[Sabina Altynbekova]] took part.\n\nIn April 2017, Dugalova expressed interest in representing [[Kazakhstan in the Eurovision Song Contest]].
