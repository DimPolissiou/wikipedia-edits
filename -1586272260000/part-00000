Sharada proper was eventually restricted to very limited ceremonial use in Kashmir, as it grew increasingly unsuitable for writing the [[Kashmiri language]].<ref name=sharada/> With the last known inscription dating to 1204 C.E., the early 13th century marks a milestone in the development of Sharada.<ref name=sharada/> The regional variety in Punjab continued to evolve from this stage through the 14th century; during this period it starts to appear in forms closely resembling Gurmukh\u012b and other [[Landa scripts]]. By the 15th century, Sharada had evolved so considerably that [[epigraphist]]s denote the script at this point by a special name, ''Dev\u0101\u015be\u1e63a''.<ref name=sharada/> Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) prefers the name ''Pritham Gurmukh\u012b'', or Proto-Gurmukh\u012b.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] adopted proto-Gurmukh\u012b to write the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. The [[Takri]] alphabet developed through the ''Dev\u0101\u015be\u1e63a'' stage of the Sharada script from the 14th-18th centuries<ref name=sharada/> and is found mainly in the [[Punjab States Agency|Hill States]] such as [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh]] and surrounding areas, where it is called ''Chambyali'', and in [[Jammu Division]], where it is known as ''Dogri''. The local Takri variants got the status of official scripts in some of the Punjab Hill States, and were used for both administrative and literary purposes until the 19th century.<ref name=sharada/> After 1948, when [[Himachal Pradesh]] was established as an administrative unit, the local ''Takri'' variants were replaced by [[Devanagari]].\n\n[[File:Example of a Multani variant of Landa script, a mercantile shorthand script of Punjab, from 1880.png|thumb|left|Example of a [[Multani alphabet|Multani]] variant of [[La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts|Landa script]], a mercantile shorthand script of Punjab, from 1880<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2012/12316-multani.pdf| title=N4159: Proposal to Encode the Multani Script in ISO/IEC 10646 | first1=Anshuman | last1=Pandey | publisher=Working Group Document, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2009-01-29}}</ref>]]\nMeanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. ''Landa'' means alphabet \"without tail\",<ref name=cardonajain594/> implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, [[Mahajani]] being the most popular. The La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were used for household and trade purposes. Compared to the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Sikh Gurus favored the use of Proto-Gurmukh\u012b, because of the difficulties involved in pronouncing words without vowel signs.\n\nThe usage of Gurmukh\u012b letters in the Guru Granth Sahib meant that the script developed its own orthographical rules. In the following epochs, Gurmukh\u012b became the prime script applied for the literary writings of the Sikhs. The [[Singh Sabha Movement]] of the late 1800s, a movement to revitalize Sikh institutions which had declined during [[British Raj|colonial rule]] after the fall of the [[Sikh Empire]], also advocated for the usage of the Gurmukhi script for [[mass media]], with print media publications and [[Khalsa Akhbar Lahore|Punjabi-language newspapers]] established in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deol |first1=Dr. Harnik |title=Religion and Nationalism in India: The Case of the Punjab |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, United Kingdom |isbn=9781134635351 |page=72 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHi5j81VHEC&dq=Khalsa+Akhbar+Lahore&q=khalsa+akhbar#v=snippet&q=khalsa%20akhbar&f=false |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Later in the 20th century, after the struggle of the [[Punjabi Suba movement]], from the founding of modern India in the 1940s to the 1960s, the script was given the authority as the official script of the [[Punjab, India]].<ref name=\"Bright1996p395\"/><ref name=jaincardona53/>\n\n===The term ''Gurmukh\u012b''===\nThe prevalent view among Punjabi linguists is that as in the early stages the Gurmukh\u012b letters were primarily used by the Guru's followers, [[Gurmukh]]s (literally, those who face, or follow, the Guru, as opposed to a [[Manmukh]]); the script thus came to be known as ''Gurmukh\u012b'', \"[the script] of those guided by the Guru.\"<ref name=cardonajain83/> [[Guru Angad]] is credited in the Sikh tradition with the creation and standardization of Gurmukhi script from earlier [[Sharada script|\u015a\u0101rad\u0101]]-descended scripts native to the region.

The opinion traditional scholars for this is that as the Sikh holy writings, before they were written down, were uttered by the Gurus, they came to be known as Gurmukh\u012b or the \"Utterance of the Guru\". Consequently, the script that was used for scribing the utterance was also given the same name. The term that would mean \"by the Guru's mouth\" would be \"Gurm\u016b\u0303h\u012b\u0303,\" which sounds considerably different but looks similar in Latin script.\n\n==Alphabet==\n===Consonants===\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Gurmukhi phonetic chart.png|thumb|right|Phonetic organization of the Gurmukhi characters]]\nThe Gurmukh\u012b alphabet contains thirty-five letters (''akkhar'', plural ''akkhar\u0101\u0303'').

The natural Punjabi reflex, \u0a38\u0a41\u0a30\u0a17 /s\u028a\u027e\u0259g\u1d4a/, is also used in everyday speech.\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" style=\"font-size:24px\" | \u0a4d\u0a39 || Subjoined /\u0266/ \u0a39\u2192 \u0a4d\u0a39 || align=left | The most common subscript,<ref name=cardonajain596/> this character does not create consonant clusters, but serves as part of Punjabi's characteristic tone system, indicating a raised tone. It behaves the same way in its use as the regular \u0a39(h) does in non-word-initial positions. The regular \u0a39(h) is pronounced at the beginning of words but not in other positions, where it instead raises the tone. The difference in usage is that the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels and the subscript version when there is no vowel, and is attached to consonants.\n\nFor example, the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels as in \u0a2e\u0a40\u0a02\u0a39 (transliterated as ''m\u0129h'', to show tonality, '''''m\u0129\u0301''''', \"rain\"). The subjoined \u0a39(h) acts the same way but instead is used under consonants: \u0a1a(ch) followed by \u0a5c(\u1e5b) yields \u0a1a\u0a5c (''ch\u0259\u1e5b''), but not until the rising tone is introduced via a subscript \u0a39(h) does it properly spell the word \u0a1a\u0a5c\u0a4d\u0a39 (''ch\u0259\u0301\u1e5b'', \"climb\"). \n\nThis character's function is analogous to the ''ud\u0101t'' symbol (\u0a51 U+0A51), which occurs in older texts and indicates a high tone.\n|}\n\nIn addition to the three subjoined letters, there is a half-form of the letter Yayya, /j/ '''\u0a2f\u2192\u0a4d\u0a2f''', also used exclusively for Sanskrit borrowings, and even then rarely.  Use of the subjoined /\u028b/ and conjunct /j/, already rare, is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.<ref name=\"Gurmukhi - The Sikh Alphabet\" />\n\n===Vowel diacritics===\n\nTo express [[vowels]], Gurmukh\u012b, as an [[abugida]], makes use of obligatory [[diacritics]] called ''lag\u0101 m\u0101tar\u0101'' (plural ''lag\u0113 matar\u0113''). Gurmukh\u012b is similar to [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent 'a' sound (unless at the end of a word when the 'a' is usually dropped). This inherent vowel sound can be changed by using dependent vowel signs which attach to a bearing consonant. In some cases, dependent vowel signs cannot be used&nbsp;\u2013 at the beginning of a word or syllable for instance&nbsp;\u2013 and so an independent vowel character is used instead.\n\nIndependent vowels are constructed using three bearer characters: ''\u016b\u1e5b\u0101'' (\u0a73), ''ai\u1e5b\u0101'' (\u0a05) and ''\u012b\u1e5b\u012b'' (\u0a72).

Sharada proper was eventually restricted to very limited ceremonial use in Kashmir, as it grew increasingly unsuitable for writing the [[Kashmiri language]].<ref name=sharada/> With the last known inscription dating to 1204 C.E., the early 13th century marks a milestone in the development of Sharada.<ref name=sharada/> The regional variety in Punjab continued to evolve from this stage through the 14th century; during this period it starts to appear in forms closely resembling Gurmukh\u012b and other [[Landa scripts]]. By the 15th century, Sharada had evolved so considerably that [[epigraphist]]s denote the script at this point by a special name, ''Dev\u0101\u015be\u1e63a''.<ref name=sharada/> Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) prefers the name ''Pritham Gurmukh\u012b'', or Proto-Gurmukh\u012b.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] adopted proto-Gurmukh\u012b to write the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. The [[Takri]] alphabet developed through the ''Dev\u0101\u015be\u1e63a'' stage of the Sharada script from the 14th-18th centuries<ref name=sharada/> and is found mainly in the [[Punjab States Agency|Hill States]] such as [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh]] and surrounding areas, where it is called ''Chambyali'', and in [[Jammu Division]], where it is known as ''Dogri''. The local Takri variants got the status of official scripts in some of the Punjab Hill States, and were used for both administrative and literary purposes until the 19th century.<ref name=sharada/> After 1948, when [[Himachal Pradesh]] was established as an administrative unit, the local ''Takri'' variants were replaced by [[Devanagari]].\n\n[[File:Example of a Multani variant of Landa script, a mercantile shorthand script of Punjab, from 1880.png|thumb|left|Example of a [[Multani alphabet|Multani]] variant of [[La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts|Landa script]], a mercantile shorthand script of Punjab, from 1880<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2012/12316-multani.pdf| title=N4159: Proposal to Encode the Multani Script in ISO/IEC 10646 | first1=Anshuman | last1=Pandey | publisher=Working Group Document, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2009-01-29}}</ref>]]\nMeanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. ''Landa'' means alphabet \"without tail\",<ref name=cardonajain594/> implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, [[Mahajani]] being the most popular. The La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were used for household and trade purposes. Compared to the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Sikh Gurus favored the use of Proto-Gurmukh\u012b, because of the difficulties involved in pronouncing words without vowel signs.\n\nThe usage of Gurmukh\u012b letters in the Guru Granth Sahib meant that the script developed its own orthographical rules. In the following epochs, Gurmukh\u012b became the prime script applied for the literary writings of the Sikhs. The [[Singh Sabha Movement]] of the late 1800s, a movement to revitalize Sikh institutions which had declined during [[British Raj|colonial rule]] after the fall of the [[Sikh Empire]], also advocated for the usage of the Gurmukhi script for [[mass media]], with print media publications and [[Khalsa Akhbar Lahore|Punjabi-language newspapers]] established in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deol |first1=Dr. Harnik |title=Religion and Nationalism in India: The Case of the Punjab |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, United Kingdom |isbn=9781134635351 |page=72 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHi5j81VHEC&dq=Khalsa+Akhbar+Lahore&q=khalsa+akhbar#v=snippet&q=khalsa%20akhbar&f=false |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Later in the 20th century, after the struggle of the [[Punjabi Suba movement]], from the founding of modern India in the 1940s to the 1960s, the script was given the authority as the official script of the [[Punjab, India]].<ref name=\"Bright1996p395\"/><ref name=jaincardona53/>\n\n===The term ''Gurmukh\u012b''===\nThe prevalent view among Punjabi linguists is that as in the early stages the Gurmukh\u012b letters were primarily used by the Guru's followers, [[Gurmukh]]s (literally, those who face, or follow, the Guru, as opposed to a [[Manmukh]]); the script thus came to be known as ''Gurmukh\u012b'', \"[the script] of those guided by the Guru.\"<ref name=cardonajain83/> [[Guru Angad]] is credited in the Sikh tradition with the creation and standardization of Gurmukhi script from earlier [[Sharada script|\u015a\u0101rad\u0101]]-descended scripts native to the region. It is now the standard writing script for the Punjabi language in India.<ref name=shacklexvii>{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 978-0-415-26604-8 | pages=xvii\u2013xviii}}</ref> The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.<ref name=shacklexvii/>\n\nAlthough the word Gurmukh\u012b has been commonly translated as \"from the Mouth of the Guru,\" the term used for the Punjabi script has somewhat different connotations. The opinion traditional scholars for this is that as the Sikh holy writings, before they were written down, were uttered by the Gurus, they came to be known as Gurmukh\u012b or the \"Utterance of the Guru\". Consequently, the script that was used for scribing the utterance was also given the same name. The term that would mean \"by the Guru's mouth\" would be \"Gurm\u016b\u0303h\u012b\u0303,\" which sounds considerably different but looks similar in Latin script.\n\n==Alphabet==\n===Consonants===\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Gurmukhi phonetic chart.png|thumb|right|Phonetic organization of the Gurmukhi characters]]\nThe Gurmukh\u012b alphabet contains thirty-five letters (''akkhar'', plural ''akkhar\u0101\u0303''). The first three are distinct because they form the basis for vowels and are not consonants (''vianjan'') like the remaining letters are, and except for the second letter ''\u025b\u1e5ba'' are never used on their own.

It behaves the same way in its use as the regular \u0a39(h) does in non-word-initial positions. The regular \u0a39(h) is pronounced at the beginning of words but not in other positions, where it instead raises the tone. The difference in usage is that the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels and the subscript version when there is no vowel, and is attached to consonants.\n\nFor example, the regular \u0a39 is used after vowels as in \u0a2e\u0a40\u0a02\u0a39 (transliterated as ''m\u0129h'', to show tonality, '''''m\u0129\u0301''''', \"rain\"). The subjoined \u0a39(h) acts the same way but instead is used under consonants: \u0a1a(ch) followed by \u0a5c(\u1e5b) yields \u0a1a\u0a5c (''ch\u0259\u1e5b''), but not until the rising tone is introduced via a subscript \u0a39(h) does it properly spell the word \u0a1a\u0a5c\u0a4d\u0a39 (''ch\u0259\u0301\u1e5b'', \"climb\"). \n\nThis character's function is analogous to the ''ud\u0101t'' symbol (\u0a51 U+0A51), which occurs in older texts and indicates a high tone.\n|}\n\nIn addition to the three subjoined letters, there is a half-form of the letter Yayya, /j/ '''\u0a2f\u2192\u0a4d\u0a2f''', also used exclusively for Sanskrit borrowings, and even then rarely.  Use of the subjoined /\u028b/ and conjunct /j/, already rare, is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.<ref name=\"Gurmukhi - The Sikh Alphabet\" />\n\n===Vowel diacritics===\n\nTo express [[vowels]], Gurmukh\u012b, as an [[abugida]], makes use of obligatory [[diacritics]] called ''lag\u0101 m\u0101tar\u0101'' (plural ''lag\u0113 matar\u0113''). Gurmukh\u012b is similar to [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent 'a' sound (unless at the end of a word when the 'a' is usually dropped).
