The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

(born 9 May 1936) is an English actress and politician. A professional actress from the late 1950s onwards, Jackson spent four years as a member of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] from 1964, and was particularly associated with the work of director [[Peter Brook]]. She has won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]: for ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1970) and ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973). She has also won awards for her performances as Alex in the film ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' and in the BBC television serial ''[[Elizabeth R]]'' (both 1971); receiving two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for the latter. In 2018, Jackson won a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for her performance in a revival of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Three Tall Women]]'', and is thus one of the few performers to have achieved the \"[[Triple Crown of Acting|triple crown of acting]]\".\n\nJackson has also had a career in politics, which began in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], when she was elected as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]]. Early in the government of [[Tony Blair]], she served as a Junior Transport minister from 1997 to 1999, later becoming critical of Blair. After constituency-boundary changes, from 2010 she represented [[Hampstead and Kilburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Kilburn]].

A later film version directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] was released as ''[[Hedda (film)|Hedda]]'' (1975), for which Jackson was nominated for an Oscar. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] praised Jackson's performance: \"This version of ''Hedda Gabler'' is all Miss Jackson's Hedda and, I must say, great fun to watch ...

The nephew of a diplomat, he himself became a diplomat by the age of thirty, and came to know both Emperor Charles V and King Francis of France, and he negotiated with both on behalf of the pope. His uncle, [[Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi|Alberto Pio da Carpi]], had been educated by [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]], and had become a noted humanist scholar. These associations formed Rodolfo's background and education. He formed a notable library and participated in the humanist studies of 16th-century Rome, even though he served on the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Roman Inquisition]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pio|first=Giovanni Michele|title=Della Nobile et generosa progenie del P.

Giovanni of Toledo.</ref> He helped to establish the [[Inquisition]] at Milan.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===The Family of Pio di Savoia da Carpi===\nThe Lords of Carpi first made a position for themselves in the 14th century. From the house of Este they received the lordship of Carpi, and in 1518, through the influence of [[Pope Leo X]], they acquired the subsidiary fiefs of Meldola and Sassuolo, with which Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was invested. Many members of the family continued in the family tradition as [[Condottiere|condottieri]]: Alberto Pio obtained from the [[house of Savoy]] in 1450 the privilege of adding \"di Savoia\" to his name, as a reward for his military services. Others besides Cardinal Carpi made careers in diplomacy: [[Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi|Alberto Pio]] (1475-1531) who was Imperial ambassador in Rome<ref>He had taken refuge in France after the Sack of Rome,  but from 1527 to 1529 was the major intermediary between the French Court and the Papal Court: Lestocquoy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxxiii.</ref> won fame as a man of learning. Ascanio Pio (d. 1649) was a dramatic poet. Spain conferred the title of prince on the family, and one branch of the family is to this day established in Spain.\n\n===Pio's education and early career===\nRodolfo Pio da Carpi was born in [[Carpi, Modena|Carpi]] near [[Modena]], where his uncle Alberto (c. 1475-1531) was lord of Carpi. His father was Lionello da Carpi and his mother was Maria Martinengo.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christiane|last=Hoffmann|title=Kardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi und seine Reform der Aegidianischen Konstitutionen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo31UXrSvpcC&pg=PA11|year=1989|publisher=Duncker & Humblot|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-428-46708-2|page=11}}</ref> In 1516 he was a Chevalier of the Knights of S. John of Jerusalem and Commendatory of the church of S. Lorenzo di Colorno in the diocese of Parma.

There Carpi presided over a [[synod]] in 1533. He was absent, however, during most of the sixteen years of his episcopate, and therefore the duties of his office were performed by his brother Teodoro and by Segicellus of Faventia.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ferdinando|last=Ughelli|editor=Nicolaus Colet|title=Italia sacra sive de Episcopis Italiae, et insularum adjacentium, rebusque ab iis praeclare gestis ... opus singulare, provinciis XX distinctum ... auctore D.F.

He was received by Francis at Lyon on 11 June. The Pope wanted to meet at Nice, but eventually the meeting took place in Marseille, where the marriage of Henri II and Catherine de' Medici was solemnized, and where Pope Clement was able to engage in negotiations with both Francis I and Charles V.<ref>Lestocquoy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxxiii-xxxiv.</ref>\n\nCarpi attracted further notice in papal diplomacy when he was established as papal [[Nuncio]] at the court of [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]] (1535 &ndash; 1537). His commission was dated 9 January 1535; he joined the Court at Saint-Germain on 17 February.<ref>Lestocquoy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxxiv.</ref> There he negotiated a peace between King Francis and the Emperor [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]], who was pleased enough to appoint him \"protector of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\". While Carpi was in France in 1533, there were rumors being spread around Rome, suggesting that Carpi was furnishing information to the Imperialists. Carpi was advised about these rumors by Pope Paul's secretary, Ambrogio Ricalcato, who also indicated that they were being circulated by agents of the Cardinal de Lorraine. Evidently King Francis heard about these rumors as well, since, in the middle of the night of 26 January 1536 he summoned Carpi to tell him that he deplored these rumors and considered Carpi a good servant. The King wrote to the Pope, asking for a red hat for Carpi; the Pope replied that it would be a subject for the next Consistory for the creation of cardinals.<ref>Lestocquoy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxxv.</ref> Carpi also initiated discussions about having a general council of the Church to address the problems of heresy and church reform, though it became clear immediately that the King and the Emperor had entirely different views as to how, and where, and what.<ref name=\"Cardella1793\">{{cite book|first=Lorenzo|last=Cardella|title=Memorie storiche de' cardinali della santa Romana Chiesa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8UOAAAAQAAJ|volume=Tomo quarto|year=1793|publisher=Pagliarini|location=Roma|language=Italian|page=174}} Lestocquoy, \"Introduction\", pp. xix-xx.</ref> He left France in July 1537, having already been appointed Cardinal.\n\n===The Cardinalate===\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] created Rodolfo Pio da Carpi a cardinal in the Consistory of 22 December 1536, and on 23 July 1537, he was given his cardinal's ring and the [[Titular church|''titulus'']] of [[Santa Pudenziana]].<ref>Wilelmus Gulik and Conradus Eubel, ''Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi'' Tomus III, editio altera (Monasterii 1923) p. 25.</ref> He exchanged S.

Both cardinals had a personal interview with King Francis at Montpellier in mid-January 1538.<ref>Hoffmann, p. 19.</ref> His purpose, and Jacobazzi's, was to bring together Francis I and Charles V in a meeting with Pope Paul III. The meeting duly took place in May, though at Nice rather than at Montpellier,<ref>De Leva, III, pp. 237-241.</ref> but Cardinal Carpi did not attend.

After restoring order, Carpi's most important work in that office was the revision of the Aegidian Constitutions, by which the March had been governed since 1357. Carpi's work, into which he drew the assistance of fourteen experts, was finally given approval and authorization by Pope Paul III in September 1544.<ref>{{cite book|first=Filippo|last=Ermini|title=Gli ordinamenti politici e amministrativi nelle \"Constitutiones Aegidianae\"|url=https://archive.org/details/gliordinamentip00ermigoog|year=1893|publisher=Fratelli Bocca|location=Torino|language=Italian|page=[https://archive.org/details/gliordinamentip00ermigoog/page/n18 13]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1543, Cardinal Carpi composed a Memorandum for the Emperor Charles V, entitled \"Discorso del rev. card. di Carpi del 1543 a Carlo V Cesare del modo di dominare.\" The manuscript has never been published, but brief quotations have been published by Ludwig Pastor.<ref>Hoffmann, pp. 25-26.</ref> The subject was the Duchy of Milan, which the Emperor Charles had taken from Francis I, and the content was advice on how to retain it. On no account should it be returned to Francis I.\n\nCardinal Carpi, as he now was, made his presence felt in the [[Roman Curia]] as a member of the Roman Inquisition and a defender of the new orders, the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]s and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].<ref>J.

He held the post until his death. He never went to Girgenti, of course, since the appointment was only a financial benefit.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 99.  Cardella, p. 174.</ref> In 1544, the Cardinal presided over the establishment of the Accademia degli Imperfetti in Meldola, the tiny principality of which his uncle Alberto Pio da Carpi had been the first ruler. This academy for the encouragement of cultured persons and the stimulation of culture itself was another of those multitudinous clubs that were formed in cities and towns throughout Italy for the pursuit of intellectual growth.<ref>[http://www.imperfecti.org/storiaac.htm L' Accademia degli Imperfetti, Meldola.]  There was a more famous academy of the same title in Venice.</ref>\n\n===Conclave of 1549-1550===\n\nPope Paul III died on Sunday, 10 November 1549.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 20 n. 2.</ref> Cardinal Pio da Carpi was one of the fifty-one cardinals who participated at one point or another in the Conclave which began on 29 November 1549. There was much illness, coming and going, and one death in the Conclave. In the first Scrutiny, which did not take place until 4 December, at which forty-one cardinals were present, Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]], the favorite candidate of the Emperor, received between 24 and 26 votes, only four (or two) votes short of a valid canonical election. The French Ambassador protested that if the election took place without the presence of the French cardinals, who were en route, he would declare the Election invalid. The French were promoting [[Giovanni Salviati]] (Bishop of Porto and cousin of [[Catherine de' Medici]], Queen of France) and Ridolfo Pio de Carpi, and were commanded to prevent the election of Cardinal Pole at all costs. Cardinal Carpi received nine votes in the fourteenth Scrutiny on 17 December, just after the majority of the French cardinals had entered the Conclave.<ref name=\"Druffel1873\">{{cite book|first=August|last=von Druffel|title=Beitr\u00e4ge zur Reichsgeschichte, 1546-55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2ZfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR2|year=1873|publisher=Reiger'sche Universit\u00e4ts-Buchhandlung (Gustav Himmer)|location=M\u00fcnchen|language=German, Latin|pages=327\u2013328}}</ref> But it was his high water mark. The French votes quickly redeployed, seeking a more viable candidate. The last of the French cardinals, the Cardinal de Bourbon, did not reach the Conclave until 14 January 1550, thereby raising the number of participants to 48. The voting had fallen into a stagnant pattern, 21 votes for Pole, 21 votes for Carafa of Naples. Forty-seven cardinals participated in the final vote, which took place on 7 February 1550 and elected Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, a member of the Farnese faction.<ref>J. P.

His uncle, [[Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi|Alberto Pio da Carpi]], had been educated by [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]], and had become a noted humanist scholar.

Many members of the family continued in the family tradition as [[Condottiere|condottieri]]: Alberto Pio obtained from the [[house of Savoy]] in 1450 the privilege of adding \"di Savoia\" to his name, as a reward for his military services. Others beside Cardinal Carpi made careers in diplomacy: the [[Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi|Alberto Pio]] (1475-1531) who was Imperial ambassador in Rome,<ref>He had taken refuge in France after the Sack of Rome,  but from 1527 to 1529 was the major intermediary between the French Court and the Papal Court: Lestocquoy, \"Introduction,\" p. xxxiii.</ref> won fame as a man of learning.

He held the post until his death.  He never went to Girgenti, of course, since the appointment was only a financial benefit.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 99.  Cardella, p. 174.</ref>  In 1544, the Cardinal presided over the establishment of the Accademia degli Imperfetti in Meldola, the tiny principality of which his uncle Alberto Pio da Carpi had been the first ruler.  This academy for the encouragement of cultured persons and the stimulation of culture itself was another of those multitudinous clubs that were formed in cities and towns throughout Italy for the pursuit of intellectual growth.<ref>[http://www.imperfecti.org/storiaac.htm L' Accademia degli Imperfetti, Meldola.]  There was a more famous academy of the same title in Venice.</ref>\n\n===Conclave of 1549-1550===\n\nPope Paul III died on Sunday, 10 November 1549.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 20 n. 2.</ref>  Cardinal Pio da Carpi was one of the fifty-one cardinals who participated at one point or another in the Conclave which began on 29 November 1549.  There was much illness, coming and going, and one death in the Conclave. In the first Scrutiny, which did not take place until 4 December, at which forty-one cardinals were present, Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]], the favorite candidate of the Emperor, received between 24 and 26 votes, only four (or two) votes short of a valid canonical election.  The French Ambassador protested that if the election took place without the presence of the French cardinals, who were en route, he would declare the Election invalid. The French were promoting [[Giovanni Salviati]] (Bishop of Porto and cousin of [[Catherine de' Medici]], Queen of France) and Ridolfo Pio de Carpi, and were commanded to prevent the election of Cardinal Pole at all costs.  Cardinal Carpi received nine votes in the fourteenth Scrutiny on 17 December, just after the majority of the French cardinals had entered the Conclave.<ref name=\"Druffel1873\">{{cite book|first=August|last=von Druffel|title=Beitr\u00e4ge zur Reichsgeschichte, 1546-55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2ZfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR2|year=1873|publisher=Reiger'sche Universit\u00e4ts-Buchhandlung (Gustav Himmer)|location=M\u00fcnchen|language=German, Latin|pages=327\u2013328}}</ref>   But it was his high water mark.  The French votes quickly redeployed, seeking a more viable candidate.  The last of the French cardinals, the Cardinal de Bourbon, did not reach the Conclave until 14 January 1550, thereby raising the number of participants to 48. The voting had fallen into a stagnant pattern, 21 votes for Pole, 21 votes for Carafa of Naples. Forty-seven cardinals participated in the final vote, which took place on 7 February 1550 and elected  Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, a member of the Farnese faction.<ref>J. P.

The new grant was for services rendered, no doubt, and in anticipation of future services on the part of a most influential Cardinal.<ref>Hoffmann, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Conclave of 1559===\nPio da Carpi was the favorite candidate of King Philip II of Spain in the Conclave of 5 September\u201426 December 1559, which followed the death of [[Pope Paul IV]], along with Jacopo Puteo (President of the Inquisition in Rome), Giovanni Angelo de' Medici (brother of the Marchese di Marignano), and Clemente D'Olera (former head of the Observant Franciscans).<ref name=\"Hinojosa1889\">{{cite book|first=Ricardo|last=de Hinojosa|title=Felipe II y el conclave de 1559|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsM_AAAAYAAJ|year=1889|publisher=Tip. de Manuel Gin\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez|location=Madrid|language=Spanish, Latin|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>  All of those candidates were rigorously orthodox, which was an essential criterion for Philip II's choice.  It was said by the French Ambassador that Cardinals Carpi and Ricci were circulating a story in the Conclave to the effect that Cardinal de' Medici had Lutheran tendencies, and that he had said that it might be necessary to loosen the requirements on celibacy of the clergy and to allow the laity to receive both the bread and the wine in Holy Communion.<ref>Letter of [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/1559_Babon_Lorraine_3.html Philibert Babou, Bishop of Angoul\u00eame, to Cardinal de Lorraine-Guise, Prime Minister of Fran\u00e7ois II].</ref> Carpi had been the leader of the Imperial faction in the Conclave of 1555.

For instance, the journalist [[James Surowiecki]] pointed out in a 2013 article for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' how in 50 years \"big business\" had changed from high-paying manufacturers to low-paying retailers\n<blockquote> In 1960, the country's biggest employer, [[General Motors]], was also its most profitable company and one of its best-paying. It had high profit margins and real pricing power, even as it was paying its workers union wages. And it was not alone: firms like Ford, Standard Oil, and Bethlehem Steel employed huge numbers of well-paid workers while earning big profits. Today, the country's biggest employers are retailers and fast-food chains, almost all of which have built their businesses on low pay\u2014they've striven to keep wages down and unions out\u2014and low prices.<ref name=low>{{cite journal|last=Surowiecki|first=James|title=The Pay Is Too Damn Low|journal=The New Yorker|date=12 August 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2013/08/12/130812ta_talk_surowiecki}}</ref> </blockquote>\nWhile these retailers and fast-food chains are profitable, their profit ''margins'' are not large, which limits their ability to follow the lead of successful companies in high-growth industries that pay relatively generous salaries, such as [[Apple Inc.]]<blockquote>The combined profits of all the major retailers, restaurant chains, and supermarkets in the Fortune 500 are smaller than the profits of Apple alone. Yet Apple employs just 76,000 people, while the retailers, supermarkets, and restaurant chains employ 5.6 million.<ref name=low/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[International Labour Organization]]'s annual \"World of Work Report\", predicted that the potential for social unrest in the [[European Union]] is the highest in the world.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|first=Robert |last=Evans\n|title=EU potential for social unrest is world's highest: ILO\n|series=International Labour Organization\n|publisher=Reuters\n|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/03/us-europe-unrest-ilo-idUSBRE9520OI20130603\n|date=3 June 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n* [[Economic history of the United States]]\n* [[Economic inequality]]\n* [[Economic stagnation]]\n* ''[[The End of Work]]''\n* [[Socioeconomic mobility in the United States]]\n* [[Wealth inequality in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Economic inequality]]\n[[Category:Income in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence_(inequality)"}

The club's new chairman was [[Carl Burkhardt]]. It was Burkhardt's second period as chairman. At the AGM he took over the presidency from [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 33 matches in their 1925\u201326 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, two were in the newly created [[Swiss Cup]] and 15 were friendly matches. Of these 15 friendlies only four were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and 11 were away games, five in Switzerland and three each in France and Germany. Four of these games were won, four draws and seven defeats. Probably one of the biggest highlights during these friendly games, was the fixture in the [[Landhof]] as [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] visited. Huddersfield had just won the [[English Football League]] championship for the third consequtive season. The game attracted 3,500 supporters. Basel lost the comparison against the english champions by five goals to one.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-ht-1925/26\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=29480 | title = FC Basel - Huddersfield Town FC 1:5 (0:2) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nAgain [[1925\u201326 Swiss Serie A|this's season the Serie A]] was divided into three regional groups, each group with nine teams. Basel were allocated to the Central group together with local clubs [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]], [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys Basel]]. The other teams allocated to this group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Bern]], [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Grenchen|Grenchen]] and the newly promoted [[FC Solothurn|Solothurn]]. The teams that won each group continue to the finals and the last placed teams in the groups had to play a barrage against relegation.\n\nBasel visited the group newcomers for the first match and promptly lost 1\u20132. Following this initial shock, the team played twelve game in succesion undefeated. However, at this point, despite having defeated the league leaders [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], they were trailing by five points. Suprisingly Basel lost their last two home games and thus ended the season in second postion nine points adrift of Young Boys, who continued to the finals. During their league season Basel won seven of their matches, drawing six and were defeated three times. In their 16 league matches the team scored just 26 goals and conceeded just 14.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz 1925/26\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1925/26 | title = Bilanz Saison 1925/26 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> [[Arnold H\u00fcrzeler]] was the team\u2019s top league goal scorer with eight goals and [[Karl Bielser]] was second top scorer with seven goals.\n\nThe very first [[Swiss Cup]] tournament was organised this season by the [[Swiss Football Association]] (and has been organised by them annually since then). In the first round Basel were drawn against lower tier FC Horgen and the game took place on 4 October 1925.

The club's new chairman was [[Carl Burkhardt]]. It was Burkhardt's second period as chairman. At the AGM he took over the presidency from [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 33 matches in their 1925\u201326 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, two were in the newly created [[Swiss Cup]] and 15 were friendly matches. Of these 15 friendlies only four were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and 11 were away games, five in Switzerland and three each in France and Germany. Four of these games were won, four draws and seven defeats. Probably one of the biggest highlights during these friendly games, was the fixture in the [[Landhof]] as [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] visited. Huddersfield had just won the [[English Football League]] championship for the third consequtive season. The game attracted 3,500 supporters. Basel lost the comparison against the english champions by five goals to one.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-ht-1925/26\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=29480 | title = FC Basel - Huddersfield Town FC 1:5 (0:2) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nAgain [[1925\u201326 Swiss Serie A|this's season the Serie A]] was divided into three regional groups, each group with nine teams. Basel were allocated to the Central group together with local clubs [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]], [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys Basel]]. The other teams allocated to this group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Bern]], [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Grenchen|Grenchen]] and the newly promoted [[FC Solothurn|Solothurn]]. The teams that won each group continue to the finals and the last placed teams in the groups had to play a barrage against relegation.\n\nBasel visited the group newcomers for the first match and promptly lost 1\u20132. Following this initial shock, the team played twelve game in succesion undefeated. However, at this point, despite having defeated the league leaders [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], they were trailing by five points. Suprisingly Basel lost their last two home games and thus ended the season in second postion nine points adrift of Young Boys, who continued to the finals. During their league season Basel won seven of their matches, drawing six and were defeated three times. In their 16 league matches the team scored just 26 goals and conceeded just 14.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz 1925/26\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1925/26 | title = Bilanz Saison 1925/26 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> [[Arnold H\u00fcrzeler]] was the team\u2019s top league goal scorer with eight goals and [[Karl Bielser]] was second top scorer with seven goals.\n\nThe very first [[Swiss Cup]] tournament was organised this season by the [[Swiss Football Association]] (and has been organised by them annually since then). In the first round Basel were drawn against lower tier FC Horgen and the game took place on 4 October 1925. Basel won their first cup match 8\u20131 and [[Arnold H\u00fcrzeler]] proved his goal scoring qualities by securing the victory for his team by scoring six of the goals.<ref
