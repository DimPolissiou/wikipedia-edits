The trail runs from [[Conception Bay South|Topsail Beach]], north to [[Cape St. Francis (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Cape St. Francis]], then south through [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]], and continues south as far as [[Cappahayden, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cappahayden]].<ref name=\":0\" /> It is intended that the trail will eventually be extended to [[Trepassey]] in the south and across to [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Placentia]] in the west (from [[Ferryland]]).<ref>[http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/north-america/canada/newfoundland-labrador/avalon-peninsula/east-coast-trail/ \"East Coast Trail\" ''Rough Guide]</ref>\n\nThe trail also passes several [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National historic sites]], including [[Signal Hill, St. John's]], [[Cape Spear]], the easternmost point in [[North America]] (ignoring [[Greenland]]), and [[Ferryland]], the site of the 17th-century [[Province of Avalon|Colony of Avalon]].

The following year the East Coat Trail Association was incorporated and it was subsequently was registered aa charity. The initial plan \"was to build and maintain\" a long distance coastal footpath from [[Topsail Beach]] to [[Trepassey]] and in 1997 the Association obtained funds from the Federal Government to develop this 220&nbsp;km trail. In 2001 this trail was officially opened.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=PjB1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA352&lpg=PA352&dq=east+coast+trail+introduction+to+nonprofit+management+text+and+cases&source=bl&ots=KXIQJy6ojk&sig=ACfU3U0cvigYbE4X1C4SNtrP272ZR9fF8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn94ScjLboAhWkAp0JHYsiCvgQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=east%20coast%20trail%20introduction%20to%20nonprofit%20management%20text%20and%20cases&f=false ''Introduction to Nonprofit Management: Text and Cases'', edited by W.

After the bombings, Japan was under the negative effects of an economical depression, with many citizens being poor and unable to afford food. That was until in 1952, [[Osamu Tezuka]], Japanese manga [[artist]] and [[cartoonist]], created a comic named ''[[Diary of Ma-chan|Diary of Ma-Chan]]'' to entertain the Japanese public in the means of helping it cope through poor conditions.\n\nHe sold his comics at a low price so that people would buy them so.

It is a part of the [[East End of London|East End]] of London, {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It was part of the ancient parish of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], Middlesex. It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Greater London]] in 1965. Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the [[City of London]], it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class.\n\nThe area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century, and the location of the infamous 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were attributed to the mysterious [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, and has the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[East London Mosque]].\n\n==History==\n===Before the 19th century===\n[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|thumb|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]\n[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Whitechapel wards of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nWhitechapel's heart is [[Whitechapel High Street]], extending further east as [[Whitechapel Road]], named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]]. The church's earliest known rector was Hugh de Fulbourne in 1329. Around 1338, it became the parish church of Whitechapel, called, for unknown reasons, [[St Mary Matfelon]]. The church was severely damaged during the Blitz and demolished in 1952, and its location and graveyard is now a [[Altab Ali Park|public garden]] on the south side of the road.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\">Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds) (1983) \"Whitechapel\" in ''The London Encyclopaedia'': 955-6</ref><ref>Andrew Davies (1990)''The East End Nobody Knows'': 15\u201316</ref>\n\nWhitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are now part of the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11 road]], anciently the initial part of the [[Roman road]] between the [[City of London]] and [[Colchester]], exiting the city at [[Aldgate]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22732 'Stepney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 7\u201313] accessed: 9 March 2007</ref> In later times, travellers to and from London on this route were accommodated at the many [[coaching inns]] which lined Whitechapel High Street.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, the suburb of Whitechapel and the surrounding area had started becoming 'the other half' of London. Located east of [[Aldgate]], outside the [[London Wall|City Walls]] and beyond official controls, it attracted the less fragrant activities of the city, particularly tanneries, breweries, foundries (including the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], which later cast [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Liberty Bell]] and London's [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]) and [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nIn 1680, the Rector of Whitechapel, [[Ralph Davenant]], of the parish of St Mary Matfelon, bequeathed a legacy for the education of forty boys and thirty girls of the parish; the [[Davenant Centre]] is still in existence although the [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved from Whitechapel to [[Loughton]] in 1966.\n\nPopulation shifts from rural areas to London from the 17th century to the mid-19th century resulted in great numbers of more or less destitute people taking up residence amidst the industries and mercantile interests that had attracted them.\n\nIn 1797, the body of the sailor [[Richard Parker (sailor)|Richard Parker]], hanged for his leading role in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Nore mutiny]], was given a Christian burial at Whitechapel after his wife [[exhume]]d it from the unconsecrated burial ground to which it was originally consigned. Crowds gathered to see the body before it was buried.\n\n===19th century===\nBy the 1840s, Whitechapel, along with the enclaves of [[Wapping]], [[Aldgate]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[Mile End]], [[Limehouse]], [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley-by-Bow]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Shadwell]] and [[Stepney]] (collectively known today as \"the [[East End of London|East End]]\"), had evolved into classic ''\"[[Dickensian]]\"'' London, with problems of poverty and overcrowding. Whitechapel Road itself was not particularly squalid through most of this period; it was the warrens of small dark streets branching from it that contained the greatest suffering, filth and danger, such as [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] (now a private alley but once described as \"the worst street in London\"<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/victorian_london/the-worst-street-in-london.html ''Ripper Casebook: 1901 The Worst Street in London''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref>), Thrawl Street, Berners Street (renamed [[Henriques Street]]), Wentworth Street, and others.\n\n[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, Whitechapel, in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on 7 August 1878 the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 February 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525050352/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london/attractions/whitechapel-road/a/poi-sig/1278840/358914</ref>\n\n[[File:Commercial Road booth map.jpg|thumb|left|Part of [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s [[poverty map]] showing Commercial Road in Whitechapel 1889.

Writing of the period 1883\u20131884, [[Yiddish theatre]] actor [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] wrote, \"The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s.\"<ref>Jacob Adler, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0679413510}}. p. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nThis endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888 the [[Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes \"of very low class\" resident in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels.<ref>Donald Rumbelow (2004) ''The Complete Jack the Ripper'': 12.

Such prostitutes were numbered amongst the 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were committed by the legendary serial killer known as '[[Jack the Ripper]]'. These attacks caused widespread terror in the district and throughout the country and drew the attention of social reformers to the squalor and vice of the area, even though these crimes remain unsolved today.<ref>Nicholas Connell (2005) ''Walter Dew: The Man Who Caught Crippen'': 7\u201355</ref>\n\nThe \"Elephant Man\" [[Joseph Merrick]] (1862\u20131890) became well known in Whitechapel \u2014 he was exhibited in a shop on the Whitechapel Road before being helped by [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] (1853\u20131923) at the [[Royal London Hospital]], opposite the actual shop.

Then Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] took over the operation where his presence caused a political row over the level of his involvement during the time. His biographers disagreed and said he gave no operational commands to the police,{{sfn|Addison|2014}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2012|p=195}} but a Metropolitan Police account states that the events of Sidney Street were \"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\".{{efn|Subsequent stories that a bullet passed through Churchill's top hat are apocryphal, and no reference to such an occurrence appears in either the official records, or Churchill's accounts of the siege.{{sfn|Waldren|2013|p=11}}}}\n\nThe [[Freedom Press]], a socialist publishing house, thought it worthwhile to explore conditions in the leading city of the nation that had invented modern capitalism. He concluded that English poverty was far rougher than the American variety. The juxtaposition of the poverty, homelessness, exploitive work conditions, prostitution, and infant mortality of Whitechapel and other East End locales with some of the greatest personal wealth the world has ever seen made it a focal point for leftist reformers and revolutionaries of all kinds, from [[George Bernard Shaw]], whose [[Fabian Society]] met regularly in Whitechapel, to [[Vladimir Lenin]], led rallies in Whitechapel during his exile from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/galleries/first-thursday-gallery-46/|title=First Thursday GALLERY 46|website=Whitechapelgallery.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> The area is still home to Freedom Press, the anarchist publishing house founded by [[Charlotte Wilson]].\n\nIn Sunday 4 October 1936, the [[British Union of Fascists]] led by [[Oswald Mosley]] clashed in the East End including a part of southern Whitechapel on [[Cable Street]] with various [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Communism|communist]] groups during the [[Battle of Cable Street]] where Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of [[Blackshirts]] through the East End, which then had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15171772|title=Cable Street: 'Solidarity stopped Mosley's fascists'|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhitechapel remained poor (and colourful) through the first half of the 20th century, though somewhat less desperately so. It suffered great damage in [[the Blitz]] and from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-weapons|V-weapon]] attacks of [[World War II]]. Since then, Whitechapel has lost most of its notoriety.\n\n[[Altab Ali]] was murdered by three teenagers on 4 May 1978 in a racist attack as he walked home after work.

[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: \"A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons.

Probably the area's most prominent art venue is the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]], founded in 1901 and long an outpost of high culture in a poor neighbourhood. As the neighbourhood has gentrified, it has gained citywide, and even international, visibility and support. From 2005 the gallery underwent a major expansion, with the support of \u00a33.26&nbsp;million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The expanded facility opened in 2009.\n\nWhitechapel in the early 21st century has figured prominently in London's punk rock/skuzz rock scene, with the main focal point for this scene being Whitechapel Factory and Rhythm Factory bar/restaurant/nightclub. This scene includes the likes of The Libertines, Zap!, [[Nova (Italian band)|Nova]], [[The Others (band)|The Others]], Razorlight, and The Rakes, all of whom have had some commercial success in the music charts.\n\nHome to centres such as London Action Resource Centre and rampART, Whitechapel is seen by many as a cultural hub for community based political activism particularly of an anti-[[authoritarian]], [[anti-war]] trend. The anarchist publishing house Freedom Press is nearby in Aldgate and one of the London chapters of Food Not Bombs serves regular meals in [[Altab Ali Park]] on Whitechapel High Street. Whitechapel Anarchist Group has also recently been formed and circulates a local freesheet called W.A.G. (Whitechapel Anarchist Group)\n\nIn the past Whitechapel has been home to such individuals as [[Rudolf Rocker]] (1873\u20131958), anarcho-syndicalist writer, historian and prominent activist who active in the area from 1895 to 1918. [[Charles Lahr]] (1885\u20131971), anarchist bookseller/publisher and secretary of Whitechapel branch of the Industrial Union of Direct Actionists (IUDA), was also a prominent figure resident in the area. Such individuals in history have helped form the culture of enthusiasm in political alternatives that is enjoyed in the community today.\n\n[[File:Whitechapel market.JPG|thumb|left|Whitechapel Street Market at night]]\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] are the most visible migrant group today, who make up 40% of the Whitechapel ward total population.<ref name=BanPop>{{NOMIS2011|id=1237320252|title=Whitechapel 2011 Census Ward|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> The [[East London Mosque]] at the end of Whitechapel Road is a major symbol of the resident Islamic community. The mosque group was established as early as 1910, and the demand for a mosque grew as the [[Sylhet]]i community grew rapidly over the years.\n\nIn 1985 this large, purpose built mosque with a dome and minaret was built in the heart of Whitechapel, attracting thousands of worshippers every week, and it was further expanded with the [[London Muslim Centre]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/?page=history History of East London Mosque] East London Mosque & London Muslim Centre.

Several chapters of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s classic [[Yiddish]] novel ''[[Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' take place in early 20th-century Whitechapel, depicted from the point of view of an impoverished East European Jewish family fleeing the pogroms. The novel ''[[Journey Through a Small Planet]]'' by [[Emanuel Litvinoff]] vividly describes Whitechapel and its Jewish inhabitants in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe prostitute and daughter of a [[Luddite]] leader Sybil Gerard, main character of [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s novel [[The Difference Engine]] comes from Whitechapel. The novel's plot begins there.\n\n''Brick Lane'', the 2003 novel by [[Monica Ali]] is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nWhitechapel is used as a location in most [[Jack the Ripper fiction]].

It is a part of the [[East End of London|East End]] of London, {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It was part of the ancient parish of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], Middlesex. It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Greater London]] in 1965. Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the [[City of London]], it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class. \n\nThe area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century, and the location of the infamous 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were attributed to the mysterious [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, and has the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[East London Mosque]].\n\n==History==\n===Before the 19th century===\n[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|thumb|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]\n[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Whitechapel wards of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nWhitechapel's heart is [[Whitechapel High Street]], extending further east as [[Whitechapel Road]], named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]]. The church's earliest known rector was Hugh de Fulbourne in 1329. Around 1338, it became the parish church of Whitechapel, called, for unknown reasons, [[St Mary Matfelon]]. The church was severely damaged during the Blitz and demolished in 1952, and its location and graveyard is now a [[Altab Ali Park|public garden]] on the south side of the road.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\">Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds) (1983) \"Whitechapel\" in ''The London Encyclopaedia'': 955-6</ref><ref>Andrew Davies (1990)''The East End Nobody Knows'': 15\u201316</ref>\n\nWhitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are now part of the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11 road]], anciently the initial part of the [[Roman road]] between the [[City of London]] and [[Colchester]], exiting the city at [[Aldgate]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22732 'Stepney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 7\u201313] accessed: 9 March 2007</ref> In later times, travellers to and from London on this route were accommodated at the many [[coaching inns]] which lined Whitechapel High Street.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, the suburb of Whitechapel and the surrounding area had started becoming 'the other half' of London. Located east of [[Aldgate]], outside the [[London Wall|City Walls]] and beyond official controls, it attracted the less fragrant activities of the city, particularly tanneries, breweries, foundries (including the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], which later cast [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Liberty Bell]] and London's [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]) and [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nIn 1680, the Rector of Whitechapel, [[Ralph Davenant]], of the parish of St Mary Matfelon, bequeathed a legacy for the education of forty boys and thirty girls of the parish; the [[Davenant Centre]] is still in existence although the [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved from Whitechapel to [[Loughton]] in 1966.\n\nPopulation shifts from rural areas to London from the 17th century to the mid-19th century resulted in great numbers of more or less destitute people taking up residence amidst the industries and mercantile interests that had attracted them.\n\nIn 1797, the body of the sailor [[Richard Parker (sailor)|Richard Parker]], hanged for his leading role in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Nore mutiny]], was given a Christian burial at Whitechapel after his wife [[exhume]]d it from the unconsecrated burial ground to which it was originally consigned. Crowds gathered to see the body before it was buried.\n\n===19th century===\nBy the 1840s, Whitechapel, along with the enclaves of [[Wapping]], [[Aldgate]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[Mile End]], [[Limehouse]], [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley-by-Bow]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Shadwell]] and [[Stepney]] (collectively known today as \"the [[East End of London|East End]]\"), had evolved into classic ''\"[[Dickensian]]\"'' London, with problems of poverty and overcrowding. Whitechapel Road itself was not particularly squalid through most of this period; it was the warrens of small dark streets branching from it that contained the greatest suffering, filth and danger, such as [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] (now a private alley but once described as \"the worst street in London\"<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/victorian_london/the-worst-street-in-london.html ''Ripper Casebook: 1901 The Worst Street in London''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref>), Thrawl Street, Berners Street (renamed [[Henriques Street]]), Wentworth Street, and others.\n\n[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, Whitechapel, in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on 7 August 1878 the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 February 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525050352/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london/attractions/whitechapel-road/a/poi-sig/1278840/358914</ref>\n\n[[File:Commercial Road booth map.jpg|thumb|left|Part of [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s [[poverty map]] showing Commercial Road in Whitechapel 1889.

Writing of the period 1883\u20131884, [[Yiddish theatre]] actor [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] wrote, \"The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s.\"<ref>Jacob Adler, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0679413510}}. p. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nThis endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888 the [[Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes \"of very low class\" resident in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels.<ref>Donald Rumbelow (2004) ''The Complete Jack the Ripper'': 12. Penguin</ref> Reference is specifically made to them in [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s ''[[Life and Labour of the People in London]]'', specially to dwellings called [[Blackwall Buildings]] belonging to Blackwall Railway. Such prostitutes were numbered amongst the 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were committed by the legendary serial killer known as '[[Jack the Ripper]]'. These attacks caused widespread terror in the district and throughout the country and drew the attention of social reformers to the squalor and vice of the area, even though these crimes remain unsolved today.<ref>Nicholas Connell (2005) ''Walter Dew: The Man Who Caught Crippen'': 7\u201355</ref>\n\nThe \"Elephant Man\" [[Joseph Merrick]] (1862\u20131890) became well known in Whitechapel \u2014 he was exhibited in a shop on the Whitechapel Road before being helped by [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] (1853\u20131923) at the [[Royal London Hospital]], opposite the actual shop. There is a museum in the hospital about his life.<ref>https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/seven-places-in-london-connected-with-the-elephant-man-020117</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1902, American author [[Jack London]], looking to write a counterpart to [[Jacob Riis]]'s seminal book ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'', donned ragged clothes and boarded in Whitechapel, detailing his experiences in ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''. Riis had recently documented the astoundingly bad conditions in large swaths of the leading city of the United States.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Siege of Sidney Street, 3 January 1911.jpeg|thumb|Home Secretary Churchill observing the events at Sidney Street, Whitechapel and Stepney]]\n\nThe [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in January 1911 was a gunfight between police and military forces and Latvian revolutionaries. Then Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] took over the operation where his presence caused a political row over the level of his involvement during the time. His biographers disagreed and said he gave no operational commands to the police,{{sfn|Addison|2014}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2012|p=195}} but a Metropolitan Police account states that the events of Sidney Street were \"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\".{{efn|Subsequent stories that a bullet passed through Churchill's top hat are apocryphal, and no reference to such an occurrence appears in either the official records, or Churchill's accounts of the siege.{{sfn|Waldren|2013|p=11}}}}\n\nThe [[Freedom Press]], a socialist publishing house, thought it worthwhile to explore conditions in the leading city of the nation that had invented modern capitalism. He concluded that English poverty was far rougher than the American variety. The juxtaposition of the poverty, homelessness, exploitive work conditions, prostitution, and infant mortality of Whitechapel and other East End locales with some of the greatest personal wealth the world has ever seen made it a focal point for leftist reformers and revolutionaries of all kinds, from [[George Bernard Shaw]], whose [[Fabian Society]] met regularly in Whitechapel, to [[Vladimir Lenin]], led rallies in Whitechapel during his exile from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/galleries/first-thursday-gallery-46/|title=First Thursday GALLERY 46|website=Whitechapelgallery.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> The area is still home to Freedom Press, the anarchist publishing house founded by [[Charlotte Wilson]].\n\nIn Sunday 4 October 1936, the [[British Union of Fascists]] led by [[Oswald Mosley]] clashed in the East End including a part of southern Whitechapel on [[Cable Street]] with various [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Communism|communist]] groups during the [[Battle of Cable Street]] where Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of [[Blackshirts]] through the East End, which then had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15171772|title=Cable Street: 'Solidarity stopped Mosley's fascists'|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhitechapel remained poor (and colourful) through the first half of the 20th century, though somewhat less desperately so. It suffered great damage in [[the Blitz]] and from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-weapons|V-weapon]] attacks of [[World War II]]. Since then, Whitechapel has lost most of its notoriety.\n\n[[Altab Ali]] was murdered by three teenagers on 4 May 1978 in a racist attack as he walked home after work. His murder took place at St Mary's Gardens by St Mary's Churchyard, the reaction provoked the mass mobilisation of the Bengali community locally and came to represent the self-organisation of the community. The churchyard he was murdered in was later renamed [[Altab Ali Park]] in his memory.\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Metropolitan line]] between Hammersmith and Whitechapel was withdrawn in 1990 and shown separately as a new line called the [[Hammersmith & City line]].{{sfn|Rose|2007}}<ref name=\"T90\">{{cite web|title=London Underground map 1990|url=http://www.clarksbury.com/cdl/maps/tube90.jpg|work=The London Tube map archive|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Crossrail]] will call at Whitechapel Station. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/stations/whitechapel/|title=Whitechapel station|website=Crossrail.co.uk|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> on the Elizabeth Line.

[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: \"A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons.

Probably the area's most prominent art venue is the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]], founded in 1901 and long an outpost of high culture in a poor neighbourhood. As the neighbourhood has gentrified, it has gained citywide, and even international, visibility and support. From 2005 the gallery underwent a major expansion, with the support of \u00a33.26 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The expanded facility opened in 2009.\n\nWhitechapel in the early 21st century has figured prominently in London's punk rock/skuzz rock scene, with the main focal point for this scene being Whitechapel Factory and Rhythm Factory bar/restaurant/nightclub. This scene includes the likes of The Libertines, Zap!, [[Nova (Italian band)|Nova]], [[The Others (band)|The Others]], Razorlight, and The Rakes, all of whom have had some commercial success in the music charts.\n\nHome to centres such as London Action Resource Centre and rampART, Whitechapel is seen by many as a cultural hub for community based political activism particularly of an anti-[[authoritarian]], [[anti-war]] trend. The anarchist publishing house Freedom Press is nearby in Aldgate and one of the London chapters of Food Not Bombs serves regular meals in [[Altab Ali Park]] on Whitechapel High Street. Whitechapel Anarchist Group has also recently been formed and circulates a local freesheet called W.A.G. (Whitechapel Anarchist Group)\n\nIn the past Whitechapel has been home to such individuals as [[Rudolf Rocker]] (1873\u20131958), anarcho-syndicalist writer, historian and prominent activist who active in the area from 1895 to 1918. [[Charles Lahr]] (1885\u20131971), anarchist bookseller/publisher and secretary of Whitechapel branch of the Industrial Union of Direct Actionists (IUDA), was also a prominent figure resident in the area. Such individuals in history have helped form the culture of enthusiasm in political alternatives that is enjoyed in the community today.\n\n[[File:Whitechapel market.JPG|thumb|left|Whitechapel Street Market at night]]\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] are the most visible migrant group today, who make up 40% of the Whitechapel ward total population.<ref name=BanPop>{{NOMIS2011|id=1237320252|title=Whitechapel 2011 Census Ward|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> The [[East London Mosque]] at the end of Whitechapel Road is a major symbol of the resident Islamic community.

Several chapters of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s classic [[Yiddish]] novel ''[[Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' take place in early 20th-century Whitechapel, depicted from the point of view of an impoverished East European Jewish family fleeing the pogroms. The novel ''[[Journey Through a Small Planet]]'' by [[Emanuel Litvinoff]] vividly describes Whitechapel and its Jewish inhabitants in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe prostitute and daughter of a [[Luddite]] leader Sybil Gerard, main character of [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s novel [[The Difference Engine]] comes from Whitechapel. The novel's plot begins there.\n\n''Brick Lane'', the 2003 novel by [[Monica Ali]] is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nWhitechapel is used as a location in most [[Jack the Ripper fiction]].
