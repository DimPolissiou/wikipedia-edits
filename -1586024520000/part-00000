The war ended after three months with the Later Jin establishing itself as sovereign tributary overlord over Joseon.<ref name=\"Djun Kil Kim\"></ref> However Joseon continued its relationship with the [[Ming dynasty]] and showed defiance in solidifying its tributary relationship with the Jurchens. It was followed by the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] in 1636.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe kingdom of [[Joseon]] had previously sent 10,069 musketeers and 3,000 archers to aid the [[Ming dynasty]] in attacking the Later Jin in 1619, which culminated in an allied defeat at the [[Battle of Sarhu]]. The Joseon general [[Gang Hong-rip]] surrendered with his remaining forces and insisted that Joseon did not hold anything against the Jurchens, having only sent reinforcements to repay an obligation to Ming.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=23}}\n\nIn 1623 a faction at the Joseon court known as the [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Westerners]] deposed King [[Gwanghaegun]] ([[Hangul]]: \uad11\ud574\uad70, [[Hanja]]: \u5149\u6d77\u541b) and installed [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] as king. The following year [[Yi Gwal]] rebelled against King Injo, but failed in ousting him, and the rebellion was crushed. Its survivors fled to the Jin court where they recommended Hong Taiji to invade Joseon. General Gang Hong-rip was also led to believe by the survivors that his family had died in the coup, so he pushed for the invasion out of a desire for revenge.\n\nMeanwhile the Westerners took on an explicitly pro-Ming and anti-Jurchen stance in their relations with the two states. Injo severed relations with the Later Jin on the advice of his advisers. The Ming general [[Mao Wenlong]]'s army of 26,000 men engaged in raids against the Jurchens from an island base off the Korean peninsula. The Westerners aided him by allowing him to station his troops in [[Uiju County|Uiju]]. \n\nThe Later Jin had lost at the [[Battle of Ningyuan]] the previous year and their khan [[Nurhaci]] died from his wounds afterwards. Peace negotiations with the Ming after the battle delayed an aggressive Ming response to the Jurchen loss, and the Ming general [[Yuan Chonghuan]] was busy fortifying the border garrisons and training new musketeers. The new khan Hong Taiji was eager for a quick victory to consolidate his position as khan. By invading Joseon he also hoped to extract much needed resources for his army and subjects, who had suffered in the war against Ming.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=64}}\n\n==War==\n[[File:Jurchen warriors.jpg|thumb|A Korean painting depicting two Jurchen warriors and their horses]]\nIn 1627, [[Hong Taiji]] dispatched [[Amin (Qing dynasty)|Amin]], [[Jirgalang]], [[Ajige]] and Yoto to Joseon with 30,000 troops under the guidance of Gang Hong-rip and Li Yongfang. The Jurchens met sharp resistance at the border towns but Joseon border garrisons were quickly defeated. On 14 January, the Jurchen army advanced into Uiju where Mao Wenlong was stationed, and Mao quickly fled with his men into the [[Bohai Sea]]. The Neunghan Fortress fell on the 21 January. Next the Jurchens attacked [[Anju, South Pyongan|Anju]]. When it became clear that defeat was inevitable, the Anju garrisons committed suicide by blowing up their gunpowder storehouse. [[Pyongyang]] fell without a fight and the Jin army  crossed the [[Taedong River]].{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=65}}\n\nBy this time news of the invasion had reached the Ming court, which immediately dispatched a relief contingent to Joseon, slowing the Jurchen advance into [[Hwangju]].{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=65}}\n\nKing Injo then dispatched an envoy to negotiate a peace treaty, but by the time the messenger returned, Injo had already fled from Hanseong ([[Seoul]]) to [[Ganghwa Island]] in panic.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=65}}\n\nDespite the Jin invasion's success, Amin was willing to negotiate a peace.

Joseon was also forced to transfer suzerainty of the Warka tribe to Jin. Furthermore, a tribute of 100 horses, 100 tiger and leopard skins, 400 bolts of cotton, and 15,000 pieces of cloth was to be extracted and gifted to the Jin Khan. Injo's brother was sent to deliver this tribute. However in later letters to the Joseon king, Hong Taiji would complain that the Koreans did not behave as if they had lost, and were not abiding by the terms of the agreement. Joseon merchants and markets continued to trade with Ming and actively aided Ming subjects by providing them with grain and rations. Hong Taiji rebuked them, saying that the food of Joseon should only be fed to Joseon subjects.{{sfn|Swope|2014|p=65}}\n\nThe relationship between Joseon and Later Jin remained uncomfortable and bleak. The invasion was bitterly resented by Joseon's statesmen and Confucian scholars, who believed that it was treacherous and unfilial for Joseon to abandon Ming considering the assistance it had provided against Japan in the past. This resentment was inflamed  in 1636 when the Manchus demanded changing the terms of diplomatic relationship from equality to Sovereign-Vassal. The Joseon Court, dominated by anti-Manchu hawks, rejected the demand. This led to the [[Qing invasion of Joseon]] in 1636.\n\nThe Ming general Yuan Chonghuan was impeached for having been duped by the Jin into entering peace negotiations, and court officials accused him of lack of agency.

It is a distinctly reddish [[semiregular variable star]] whose [[apparent magnitude]], varying between +0.0 and +1.6, has the widest range displayed by any [[first-magnitude star]]. At [[near-infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|wavelengths]], Betelgeuse is the brightest star in the night sky. Its [[Bayer designation]] is '''\u03b1 Orionis''', [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha Orionis''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Ori''' or '''\u03b1 Ori'''.\n\nClassified as a [[red supergiant]] of [[spectral type]] M1-2, Betelgeuse is one of the [[List of largest stars|largest stars]] visible to the [[naked eye]]; imagined as being at the center of the [[Solar System]], its surface would lie beyond the [[asteroid belt]] and it would engulf the orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], and possibly [[Jupiter]]. Nevertheless, there are several larger red supergiants in the [[Milky Way]], including [[Mu Cephei]] and [[VY Canis Majoris]]. Calculations of Betelgeuse\u2019s mass range from slightly under ten to a little over twenty times that of the [[Sun]]. It is calculated to be about 700 [[light-year]]s from the [[Sun]], indicating an [[absolute magnitude]] of about \u22126. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its large mass and is expected to end its evolution with a [[supernova]] explosion, most likely within 100,000 years. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the [[Orion OB1 Association]]\u2014which includes the stars in [[Orion's Belt]]\u2014this [[runaway star]] has been observed moving through the [[interstellar medium]] at a speed of {{val|30|u=km/s}}, creating a [[Bow shocks in astrophysics|bow shock]] over four [[light-year]]s wide. \n\nIn 1920, Betelgeuse became the first extrasolar star whose [[photosphere]]\u2019s angular size was measured. Subsequent studies have reported an [[angular diameter]] (i.e., apparent size) ranging from 0.042 to 0.056 [[minute of arc|arcseconds]]; that range of determinations is ascribed to non-sphericity, [[limb darkening]], [[stellar pulsations|pulsations]] and varying appearance at different [[electromagnetic radiation|wavelengths]]. It is also surrounded by a complex, asymmetric [[circumstellar envelope|envelope]], roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]] from the star itself. The Earth-observed angular diameter of Betelgeuse is exceeded only by those of [[R Doradus]] and the [[Sun]].\n\nStarting in October 2019, Betelgeuse began to dim noticeably, and by January 2020 its brightness had dropped by a factor of approximately 2.5, from magnitude 0.5 to 1.5. By 22 February 2020, Betelgeuse may have stopped dimming and started to again brighten. [[Infrared]] observations found no significant change in brightness over the last 50 years, suggesting that the dimming is due to a change in [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] rather than an underlying change in the luminosity of the star. Further studies suggested that occluding \"large-grain [[circumstellar dust]]\" may be the most likely explanation for the dimming of the star.\n\n\nThis star is identified as Aarudra in Indian Astonomy. In Tamil '\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8'.\ufffc\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n''\u03b1 Orionis'' (Latinised to ''Alpha Orionis'') is the star's [[Bayer designation|designation]] given by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. \n\nThe traditional name ''Betelgeuse'' is derived from either the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0621}} ''{{transl|ar|Ib\u1e6d al-Jauz\u0101&rsquo;}}'', meaning \"the armpit of Orion\", or {{lang|ar|\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0621}} ''{{transl|ar|Yad al-Jauz\u0101&rsquo;}}'' \"the hand of Orion\".

On the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]], Betelgeuse has moved off the [[main sequence]] and has swelled and cooled to become a [[red supergiant]]. Although young, Betelgeuse has exhausted the hydrogen in its core, causing the core to contract under the force of gravity into a hotter and denser state. As a result, it has begun to fuse [[helium]] into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] and has ignited a [[hydrogen]] shell outside the core. The hydrogen-burning shell and the contracting core cause the outer envelope to expand and cool. Its mass is such that the star will eventually fuse higher elements through [[neon]], [[magnesium]], and [[silicon]] all the way to [[iron]], at which point it will collapse and explode, probably as a [[type II supernova]].<ref name=\"SOLSTATION\">{{cite web\n |title=Betelgeuse; Release No.: 04-03\n |author=SolStation\n |publisher=Sol Company\n |url=http://www.nova.org/~sol/solcom/x-objects/betelgeuse.htm\n |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"KALER\">{{cite web\n | title=Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis)\n | publisher=University of Illinois\n | author=Kaler, James B.\n | work=Stars website\n | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/betelgeuse.html\n | accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Circumstellar dynamics ===\n[[File:ESO-Betelgeuse.jpg|thumb|left|Image from [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] showing the stellar disk and an extended [[Stellar atmosphere|atmosphere]] with a previously unknown plume of surrounding gas]]\nIn the late phase of [[stellar evolution]], massive stars like Betelgeuse exhibit high rates of [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]], possibly as much as {{Solar mass|one}} every {{val|10,000|fmt=commas|u=years}}, resulting in a complex [[circumstellar envelope|circumstellar environment]] that is constantly in flux.

Its core will eventually collapse, producing a [[supernova]] explosion and leaving behind a compact [[supernova remnant|remnant]]. The details depend on the exact initial mass and other physical properties of that main sequence star.\n\n===Main sequence===\nThe initial mass of Betelgeuse can only be estimated by testing different stellar evolutionary models to match its current observed properties. The unknowns of both the models and the current properties mean that there is considerable uncertainty in Betelgeuse's initial appearance, but its mass is usually estimated to have been in the range of {{solar mass|10\u201325}}, with modern models finding values of {{solar mass|15\u201320}}. Its chemical makeup can be reasonably assumed to have been around 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 2.4% heavy elements, slightly more metal-rich than the Sun but otherwise similar. The initial rotation rate is more uncertain, but models with slow to moderate initial rotation rates produce the best matches to Betelgeuse's current properties.<ref name=dolan2016/><ref name=vanloon/><ref name=meynet>{{cite journal|bibcode=2013EAS....60...17M|arxiv=1303.1339|title=The past and future evolution of a star like Betelgeuse|journal=Betelgeuse Workshop 2012.

Estimates range from 20,000 years to a maximum of 140,000 years. Betelgeuse appears to undergo short periods of heavy mass loss and is a [[runaway star]] moving rapidly through space, so comparisons of its current mass loss to the total lost mass are difficult.<ref name=\"dolan2016\" /><ref name=\"vanloon\" /> The surface of Betelgeuse shows enhancement of nitrogen, relatively low levels of carbon, and a high proportion of [[carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]] relative to [[carbon-12|<sup>12</sup>C]], all indicative of a star that has experienced the [[dredge-up|first dredge-up]]. However, the first dredge-up occurs soon after a star reaches the red supergiant phase and so this only means that Betelgeuse has been a red supergiant for at least a few thousand years. The best prediction is that Betelgeuse has already spent around 40,000 years as a red supergiant,<ref name=\"dolan2016\" /> having left the main sequence perhaps one million years ago.<ref name=\"meynet\" />\n\nThe current mass can be estimated from evolutionary models from the initial mass and the expected mass lost so far. For Betelgeuse, the total mass lost is predicted to be no more than about {{solar mass|one}}, giving a current mass of {{solar mass|19.4\u201319.7}}, considerably higher than estimated by other means such as pulsational properties or limb-darkening models.<ref name=\"dolan2016\" />\n\nAll stars more massive than about {{solar mass|10}} are expected to end their lives when their core collapses, typically producing a supernova explosion. Up to about {{solar mass|15}}, a type II-P supernova is always produced from the red supergiant stage.<ref name=\"meynet\" /> More massive stars can lose mass quickly enough that they evolve towards higher temperatures before their cores can collapse, particularly for rotating stars and models with especially high mass loss rates. These stars can produce type II-L or type IIb supernovae from yellow or blue supergiants, or type Ib/c supernovae from Wolf-Rayet stars.<ref name=\"groh2013\">{{Cite journal|arxiv=1308.4681|last1= Groh|first1= Jose H.|title= Fundamental properties of core-collapse Supernova and GRB progenitors: Predicting the look of massive stars before death|journal= Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume= 558|pages= A131|last2= Meynet|first2= Georges|last3= Georgy|first3= Cyril|last4= Ekstrom|first4= Sylvia|year= 2013|doi= 10.1051/0004-6361/201321906|bibcode=2013A&A...558A.131G}}</ref> Models of rotating {{solar mass|20}} stars predict a peculiar type II supernova similar to [[SN 1987A]] from a [[blue supergiant]] progenitor.<ref name=\"meynet\" /> On the other hand, non-rotating {{solar mass|20}} models predict a type II-P supernova from a red supergiant progenitor.<ref name=\"dolan2016\" />\n\nThe time until Betelgeuse explodes depends on the predicted initial conditions and on the estimate of the time already spent as a red supergiant. The total lifetime from the start of the red supergiant phase to core collapse varies from about 300,000 years for a rotating {{solar mass|25}} star, 550,000 years for a rotating {{solar mass|20}} star, and up to a million years for a non-rotating {{solar mass|15}} star. Given the estimated time since Betelgeuse became a red supergiant, estimates of its remaining lifetime range from a \"best guess\" of under 100,000 years for a non-rotating {{solar mass|20}} model to far longer for rotating models or lower-mass stars.<ref name=dolan2016/><ref name=meynet/> Betelgeuse's suspected birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association is the location of several previous supernovae.

It is a distinctly reddish [[semiregular variable star]] whose [[apparent magnitude]], varying between +0.0 and +1.6, has the widest range displayed by any [[first-magnitude star]]. At [[near-infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|wavelengths]], Betelgeuse is the brightest star in the night sky. Its [[Bayer designation]] is '''\u03b1 Orionis''', [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha Orionis''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Ori''' or '''\u03b1 Ori'''.\n\nClassified as a [[red supergiant]] of [[spectral type]] M1-2, Betelgeuse is one of the [[List of largest stars|largest stars]] visible to the [[naked eye]]; imagined as being at the center of the [[Solar System]], its surface would lie beyond the [[asteroid belt]] and it would engulf the orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], and possibly [[Jupiter]]. Nevertheless, there are several larger red supergiants in the [[Milky Way]], including [[Mu Cephei]] and [[VY Canis Majoris]]. Calculations of Betelgeuse\u2019s mass range from slightly under ten to a little over twenty times that of the [[Sun]]. It is calculated to be about 700 [[light-year]]s from the [[Sun]], indicating an [[absolute magnitude]] of about \u22126. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its large mass and is expected to end its evolution with a [[supernova]] explosion, most likely within 100,000 years. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the [[Orion OB1 Association]]\u2014which includes the stars in [[Orion's Belt]]\u2014this [[runaway star]] has been observed moving through the [[interstellar medium]] at a speed of {{val|30|u=km/s}}, creating a [[Bow shocks in astrophysics|bow shock]] over four [[light-year]]s wide. \n\nIn 1920, Betelgeuse became the first extrasolar star whose [[photosphere]]\u2019s angular size was measured. Subsequent studies have reported an [[angular diameter]] (i.e., apparent size) ranging from 0.042 to 0.056 [[minute of arc|arcseconds]]; that range of determinations is ascribed to non-sphericity, [[limb darkening]], [[stellar pulsations|pulsations]] and varying appearance at different [[electromagnetic radiation|wavelengths]]. It is also surrounded by a complex, asymmetric [[circumstellar envelope|envelope]], roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]] from the star itself. The Earth-observed angular diameter of Betelgeuse is exceeded only by those of [[R Doradus]] and the [[Sun]].\n\nStarting in October 2019, Betelgeuse began to dim noticeably, and by January 2020 its brightness had dropped by a factor of approximately 2.5, from magnitude 0.5 to 1.5. By 22 February 2020, Betelgeuse may have stopped dimming and started to again brighten. [[Infrared]] observations found no significant change in brightness over the last 50 years, suggesting that the dimming is due to a change in [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] rather than an underlying change in the luminosity of the star. Further studies suggested that occluding \"large-grain [[circumstellar dust]]\" may be the most likely explanation for the dimming of the star.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n''\u03b1 Orionis'' (Latinised to ''Alpha Orionis'') is the star's [[Bayer designation|designation]] given by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. \n\nThe traditional name ''Betelgeuse'' is derived from either the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0621}} ''{{transl|ar|Ib\u1e6d al-Jauz\u0101&rsquo;}}'', meaning \"the armpit of Orion\", or {{lang|ar|\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0621}} ''{{transl|ar|Yad al-Jauz\u0101&rsquo;}}'' \"the hand of Orion\". In English there are four common pronunciations of this name, depending on whether the first ''e'' is pronounced short or long and whether the ''s'' is pronounced 's' or 'z':<ref name=\"OED\" /><ref name=\"MWD\"/>\n*{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025b|t|\u0259l|d\u0292|u\u02d0|z}}\n*{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|i\u02d0|t|\u0259l|d\u0292|u\u02d0|z}}\n*{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u025b|t|\u0259l|d\u0292|u\u02d0|s}}\n*{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|i\u02d0|t|\u0259l|d\u0292|u\u02d0|s}},\nthe last popularized for sounding just like \"beetle-juice\".\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/280/ | title=IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> to catalog and standardize proper names for stars.

It is one of three stars that make up the [[Winter Triangle]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], and it marks the center of the [[Winter Hexagon]]. At the beginning of January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. Between mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except in [[Antarctica]] at latitudes south of 82\u00b0. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June\u2013July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 south latitude.\n\nBetelgeuse is a variable star whose [[apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] ranges between 0.0 and +1.6.<ref name=vsx/> There are periods when it will surpass Rigel to become the sixth brightest star, and occasionally it will be even brighter than [[Capella]].

Although young, Betelgeuse has exhausted the hydrogen in its core, causing the core to contract under the force of gravity into a hotter and denser state. As a result, it has begun to fuse [[helium]] into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] and has ignited a [[hydrogen]] shell outside the core. The hydrogen-burning shell and the contracting core cause the outer envelope to expand and cool.

Estimates range from 20,000 years to a maximum of 140,000 years. Betelgeuse appears to undergo short periods of heavy mass loss and is a [[runaway star]] moving rapidly through space, so comparisons of its current mass loss to the total lost mass are difficult.<ref name=\"dolan2016\" /><ref name=\"vanloon\" /> The surface of Betelgeuse shows enhancement of nitrogen, relatively low levels of carbon, and a high proportion of [[carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]] relative to [[carbon-12|<sup>12</sup>C]], all indicative of a star that has experienced the [[dredge-up|first dredge-up]]. However, the first dredge-up occurs soon after a star reaches the red supergiant phase and so this only means that Betelgeuse has been a red supergiant for at least a few thousand years. The best prediction is that Betelgeuse has already spent around 40,000 years as a red supergiant,<ref name=\"dolan2016\" /> having left the main sequence perhaps one million years ago.<ref name=\"meynet\" />\n\nThe current mass can be estimated from evolutionary models from the initial mass and the expected mass lost so far. For Betelgeuse, the total mass lost is predicted to be no more than about {{solar mass|one}}, giving a current mass of {{solar mass|19.4\u201319.7}}, considerably higher than estimated by other means such as pulsational properties or limb-darkening models.<ref name=\"dolan2016\" />\n\nAll stars more massive than about {{solar mass|10}} are expected to end their lives when their core collapses, typically producing a supernova explosion. Up to about {{solar mass|15}}, a type II-P supernova is always produced from the red supergiant stage.<ref name=\"meynet\" /> More massive stars can lose mass quickly enough that they evolve towards higher temperatures before their cores can collapse, particularly for rotating stars and models with especially high mass loss rates.

Class member functions are virtual, i.e. dispatched based on the runtime type of the object they are called on.\n\nKotlin 1.3 adds (experimental) support for contracts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew13.html|title=What's New in Kotlin 1.3 - Kotlin Programming Language|website=Kotlin|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> (inspired by Eiffel's [[design by contract]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/design-by-contract-dbc-design-considerations/1321|title=Design by Contract (DbC) design considerations|quote=Implement the full semantics of Eiffel DbC and improve upon it.|date=2012-08-16|website=Kotlin Discussions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> progamming paradigm)\n\n== Syntax ==\n{{howto|section|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Functional programming style ===\n\nKotlin relaxes Java's restriction of allowing [[Static (keyword)|static]] methods and variables to exist only within a class body. Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a <code>JvmName</code> annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, <code>@file:JvmName(\"JavaClassName\")</code>.\n\n===Main entry point===\nAs in C, C++, Java, and Go, the [[entry point]] to a Kotlin [[Computer program|program]] is a function named \"main\", which may be passed an array containing any [[Command-line interface|command line]] arguments. (This is optional since Kotlin 1.3<ref>{{cite web |url = https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world |title = Kotlin Examples: Learn Kotlin Programming By Example}}</ref>). [[Perl]] and [[Unix shell]] style [[string interpolation]] is supported. [[Type inference]] is also supported.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n\n// Hello, World! example\nfun main() {\n    val scope = \"World\"\n    println(\"Hello, $scope!\")\n}\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    for (arg in args) {\n        println(arg)\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Extension methods===\n\nSimilar to C#, Kotlin allows a user to add methods to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new methods. Instead, Kotlin adds the concept of an [[extension method]] which allows a function to be \"glued\" onto the public method list of any class without being formally placed inside of the class.  In other words, an extension method is a helper method that has access to all the public interface of a class which it can use to create a new method interface to a target class and this method will appear exactly like a method of the class, appearing as part of code completion inspection of class methods. For example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\npackage MyStringExtensions\n\nfun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1)\n\n>>> println(\"Kotlin\".lastChar()) \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a {{code|lastChar}} method that was not included in the original definition of the String class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Overloading '+' operator using an extension method\noperator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point {\n    return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n}\n\n>>> val p1 = Point(10, 20)\n>>> val p2 = Point(30, 40)\n>>> println(p1 + p2)\nPoint(x=40, y=60)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Unpack arguments with spread operator===\n\nSimilar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as comma-separated arguments to a function:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) { \n    val list = listOf(\"args: \", *args)\n    println(list)\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deconstructor methods===\n{{Distinguish|Destructor (computer programming)|text=the [[Destructor (computer programming)|destructor]]  method common in object oriented languages}}\nA deconstructor's job is to decompose a class object into a tuple of elemental objects.  For example, a 2D coordinate class might be deconstructed into a tuple of integer x and integer y.\n\nFor example, the collection object contains a deconstructor method that splits each collection item into an index and an element variable:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfor ((index, element) in collection.withIndex()) { \n     println(\"$index: $element\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Nested functions===\n\nKotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nclass User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)\n    \nfun saveUserToDb(user: User) {\n    fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) {\n        if (value.isEmpty()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Can't save user ${user.id}: empty $fieldName\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    validate(user, user.name, \"Name\") \n    validate(user, user.address, \"Address\")\n    // Save user to the database \n    ...\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Classes are final by default===\n\nIn Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as \"open\".  This is in contrast to most object oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default.\n\nExample of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// open on the class means this class will allow derived classes\nopen class MegaButton  {\n\n    // no-open on a function means that \n    //    polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class\n    fun disable() { ... }\n\n    // open on a function means that\n    //    polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class\n    open fun animate() { ... }\n}\n\nclass GigaButton: MegaButton {\n\n    // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class\n    override fun animate() { println(\"Giga Click!\") } \n}\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Abstract classes are open by default===\n\nAbstract classes define abstract or \"Pure Virtual\" placeholder function that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// No need for the open keyword here, it\u2019s already open by default\nabstract class Animated {\n\n    // This virtual function is already open by default as well\n    abstract fun animate()\n  \n    open fun stopAnimating() { }\n\n    fun animateTwice() { }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Classes are public by default===\n\nKotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members:\n    public, internal, protected, and private.\n\nWhen applied to a class member:\n    public (default): Visible everywhere \n    internal:         Visible in a module \n    protected:        Visible in subclasses \n    private:          Visible in a class\n\nWhen applied to a top-level declaration\n    public (default):  Visible everywhere\n    internal:          Visible in a module\n    private:           Visible in a file\n\nExample:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Class is visible only to current module\ninternal open class TalkativeButton : Focusable {\n    // method is only visible to current class \n    private   fun yell() = println(\"Hey!\")\n\n    // method is visible to current class and derived classes\n    protected fun whisper() = println(\"Let's talk!\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Primary constructor vs. secondary constructors ===\n\nKotlin supports the specification of a \"primary constructor\" as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists, that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super-interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor.\n    \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using primary constructor syntax\n// (Only one constructor required for this class)\nopen class PowerUser : User (\n    protected val nickname: String, \n    final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true) \n    {\n         ...\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHowever, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class,  a more general constructor can be used called '''secondary constructor syntax''' which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using secondary constructor syntax\n// (more than one constructor required for this class)\nclass MyButton : View {\n\n    // Constructor #1 \n    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { \n        // ... \n    } \n  \n    // Constructor #2\n    constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { \n        // ... \n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Data Class ===\nKotlin provides Data Classes to define classes that store only properties. In Java programming, classes that store only properties are not unusual, but regular classes are used for this purpose. Kotlin has given provision to exclusively define classes that store properties alone. These data classes do not have any methods but only properties. A data class does not contain a body, unlike a regular class. '''data''' keyword is used before '''class''' keyword to define a data class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array) {\n    // create a data class object like any other class object\n    var book1 = Book(\"Kotlin Programming\", 250)\n    println(book1)\n    // output: Book(name=Kotlin Programming, price=250)\n}\n     \n// data class with parameters and their optional default values\ndata class Book(val name: String = \"\", val price: Int = 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Anko library===\n\nAnko is a library specifically created for Kotlin to help build [[Android (Operating System)|Android]] UI applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Kotlin/anko|title=Kotlin/anko|date=February 11, 2020|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n    fun Activity.showAreYouSureAlert(process: () -> Unit) {\n        alert(\n            title   = \"Are you sure?\",\n            message = \"Are you really sure?\") \n            {\n                positiveButton(\"Yes\") { process() }\n                negativeButton(\"No\") { cancel() }\n            }\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin interactive shell===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc-jvm\ntype :help for help; :quit for quit\n>>> 2 + 2\n4\n>>> println(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n>>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin as a scripting language===\n\nKotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (.kts) with top level executable code.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// list_folders.kts\nimport java.io.File\nval folders = File(args[0]).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() }\nfolders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nScripts can be run by passing the <code>-script</code> option and the corresponding script file to the compiler.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts \"path_to_folder_to_inspect\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Complex \"hello world\" example===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    greet {\n        to.place\n    }.print()\n}\n\n// Inline higher-order functions\ninline fun greet(s: () -> String) : String = greeting andAnother s()\n\n// Infix functions, extensions, type inference, nullable types, \n// lambda expressions, labeled this, Elvis operator (?:)\ninfix fun String.andAnother(other : Any?) = buildString() \n{ \n    append(this@andAnother); append(\" \"); append(other ?: \"\") \n}\n\n// Immutable types, delegated properties, lazy initialization, string templates\nval greeting by lazy { val doubleEl: String = \"ll\"; \"he${doubleEl}o\" }\n\n// Sealed classes, companion objects\nsealed class to { companion object { val place = \"world\"} }\n\n// Extensions, Unit\nfun String.print() = println(this)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a \"?\" postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: null-check must be performed before using the value. Kotlin provides null-safe operators to help developers:\n\n* {{mono|?.}} ([[safe navigation operator]]) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null.\n* {{mono|?:}} ([[null coalescing operator]]) often referred to as the [[Elvis operator]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\nfun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) {\n    // use of elvis operator\n    val name: String = maybe ?: \"stranger\"\n    println(\"Hello $name\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn example of the use of the safe navigation operator:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// returns null if...\n// - foo() returns null,\n// - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null,\n// - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null.\n// vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null\nfoo()?.bar()?.baz()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin provides support for [[higher order functions]] and [[anonymous functions]] or lambdas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html|website=Kotlin|publisher=Jetbrains|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string, \"lambda\"\n// note that (s: String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type\nfun executeLambda(f: (s: String) -> Unit) {\n    f(\"lambda\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nLambdas are declared using braces, {{mono|{  } }}. If a lambda takes parameters, they are declared within the braces and followed by the {{mono|->}} operator.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// the following statement defines a lambda that takes a single parameter and passes it to the println function\nval l = { c : Any? -> println(c) }\n// lambdas with no parameters may simply be defined using { }\nval l2 = { print(\"no parameters\") }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Tools==\n* [[IntelliJ IDEA]] has plug-in support for Kotlin.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin |title = Kotlin :: JetBrains Plugin Repository |website = Plugins.jetbrains.com |date = 2017-03-31 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> IntelliJ IDEA 15 is the first version to bundle the Kotlin plugin in the IntelliJ Installer, and provide Kotlin support out of the box.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/ |title = What's New in IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1 |website = Jetbrains.com |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref>\n* JetBrains also provides a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html |title = Getting Started with Eclipse Neon \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = Kotlinlang.org |date = 2016-11-10 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse |title = JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse: Kotlin Plugin for Eclipse |publisher = GitHub |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> \n* Integration with common Java build tools is supported including [[Apache Maven]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html |title = Using Maven \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> [[Apache Ant]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-ant.html |title = Using Ant \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> and [[Gradle]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html |title = Using Gradle \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref>\n* [[Android Studio]]  (based on IntelliJ IDEA) has official support for Kotlin, starting from Android Studio 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.android.com/kotlin|title=Kotlin and Android|website=Android Developers}}</ref>\n* [[Emacs]] has a Kotlin Mode in its Melpa package repository.\n* [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] has a plugin maintained on Github.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/udalov/kotlin-vim|publisher=GitHub|title=udalov/kotlin-vim: Kotlin plugin for Vim.

Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a <code>JvmName</code> annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, <code>@file:JvmName(\"JavaClassName\")</code>.\n\n===Main entry point===\nAs in C, C++, Java, and Go, the [[entry point]] to a Kotlin [[Computer program|program]] is a function named \"main\", which may be passed an array containing any [[Command-line interface|command line]] arguments. (This is optional since Kotlin 1.3<ref>{{cite web |url = https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world |title = Kotlin Examples: Learn Kotlin Programming By Example}}</ref>). [[Perl]] and [[Unix shell]] style [[string interpolation]] is supported. [[Type inference]] is also supported.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n\n// Hello, World! example\nfun main() {\n    val scope = \"World\"\n    println(\"Hello, $scope!\")\n}\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    for (arg in args) {\n        println(arg)\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Extension methods===\n\nSimilar to C#, Kotlin allows a user to add methods to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new methods. Instead, Kotlin adds the concept of an [[extension method]] which allows a function to be \"glued\" onto the public method list of any class without being formally placed inside of the class.  In other words, an extension method is a helper method that has access to all the public interface of a class which it can use to create a new method interface to a target class and this method will appear exactly like a method of the class, appearing as part of code completion inspection of class methods. For example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\npackage MyStringExtensions\n\nfun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1)\n\n>>> println(\"Kotlin\".lastChar()) \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a {{code|lastChar}} method that was not included in the original definition of the String class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Overloading '+' operator using an extension method\noperator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point {\n    return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n}\n\n>>> val p1 = Point(10, 20)\n>>> val p2 = Point(30, 40)\n>>> println(p1 + p2)\nPoint(x=40, y=60)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Unpack arguments with spread operator===\n\nSimilar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as comma-separated arguments to a function:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) { \n    val list = listOf(\"args: \", *args)\n    println(list)\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deconstructor methods===\n{{Distinguish|Destructor (computer programming)|text=the [[Destructor (computer programming)|destructor]]  method common in object oriented languages}}\nA deconstructor's job is to decompose a class object into a tuple of elemental objects.  For example, a 2D coordinate class might be deconstructed into a tuple of integer x and integer y.\n\nFor example, the collection object contains a deconstructor method that splits each collection item into an index and an element variable:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfor ((index, element) in collection.withIndex()) { \n     println(\"$index: $element\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Nested functions===\n\nKotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nclass User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)\n    \nfun saveUserToDb(user: User) {\n    fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) {\n        if (value.isEmpty()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Can't save user ${user.id}: empty $fieldName\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    validate(user, user.name, \"Name\") \n    validate(user, user.address, \"Address\")\n    // Save user to the database \n    ...\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Classes are final by default===\n\nIn Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as \"open\".  This is in contrast to most object oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default.\n\nExample of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// open on the class means this class will allow derived classes\nopen class MegaButton  {\n\n    // no-open on a function means that \n    //    polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class\n    fun disable() { ... }\n\n    // open on a function means that\n    //    polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class\n    open fun animate() { ... }\n}\n\nclass GigaButton: MegaButton {\n\n    // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class\n    override fun animate() { println(\"Giga Click!\") } \n}\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Abstract classes are open by default===\n\nAbstract classes define abstract or \"Pure Virtual\" placeholder function that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// No need for the open keyword here, it\u2019s already open by default\nabstract class Animated {\n\n    // This virtual function is already open by default as well\n    abstract fun animate()\n  \n    open fun stopAnimating() { }\n\n    fun animateTwice() { }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Classes are public by default===\n\nKotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members:\n    public, internal, protected, and private.\n\nWhen applied to a class member:\n    public (default): Visible everywhere \n    internal:         Visible in a module \n    protected:        Visible in subclasses \n    private:          Visible in a class\n\nWhen applied to a top-level declaration\n    public (default):  Visible everywhere\n    internal:          Visible in a module\n    private:           Visible in a file\n\nExample:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Class is visible only to current module\ninternal open class TalkativeButton : Focusable {\n    // method is only visible to current class \n    private   fun yell() = println(\"Hey!\")\n\n    // method is visible to current class and derived classes\n    protected fun whisper() = println(\"Let's talk!\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Primary constructor vs. secondary constructors ===\n\nKotlin supports the specification of a \"primary constructor\" as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists, that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super-interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor.\n    \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using primary constructor syntax\n// (Only one constructor required for this class)\nopen class PowerUser : User (\n    protected val nickname: String, \n    final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true) \n    {\n         ...\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHowever, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class,  a more general constructor can be used called '''secondary constructor syntax''' which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using secondary constructor syntax\n// (more than one constructor required for this class)\nclass MyButton : View {\n\n    // Constructor #1 \n    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { \n        // ... \n    } \n  \n    // Constructor #2\n    constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { \n        // ... \n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Data Class ===\nKotlin provides Data Classes to define classes that store only properties. In Java programming, classes that store only properties are not unusual, but regular classes are used for this purpose. Kotlin has given provision to exclusively define classes that store properties alone. These data classes do not have any methods but only properties. A data class does not contain a body, unlike a regular class. '''data''' keyword is used before '''class''' keyword to define a data class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array) {\n    // create a data class object like any other class object\n    var book1 = Book(\"Kotlin Programming\", 250)\n    println(book1)\n    // output: Book(name=Kotlin Programming, price=250)\n}\n     \n// data class with parameters and their optional default values\ndata class Book(val name: String = \"\", val price: Int = 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Anko library===\n\nAnko is a library specifically created for Kotlin to help build [[Android (Operating System)|Android]] UI applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Kotlin/anko|title=Kotlin/anko|date=February 11, 2020|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n    fun Activity.showAreYouSureAlert(process: () -> Unit) {\n        alert(\n            title   = \"Are you sure?\",\n            message = \"Are you really sure?\") \n            {\n                positiveButton(\"Yes\") { process() }\n                negativeButton(\"No\") { cancel() }\n            }\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin interactive shell===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc-jvm\ntype :help for help; :quit for quit\n>>> 2 + 2\n4\n>>> println(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n>>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin as a scripting language===\n\nKotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (.kts) with top level executable code.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// list_folders.kts\nimport java.io.File\nval folders = File(args[0]).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() }\nfolders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nScripts can be run by passing the <code>-script</code> option and the corresponding script file to the compiler.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts \"path_to_folder_to_inspect\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Complex \"hello world\" example===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    greet {\n        to.place\n    }.print()\n}\n\n// Inline higher-order functions\ninline fun greet(s: () -> String) : String = greeting andAnother s()\n\n// Infix functions, extensions, type inference, nullable types, \n// lambda expressions, labeled this, Elvis operator (?:)\ninfix fun String.andAnother(other : Any?) = buildString() \n{ \n    append(this@andAnother); append(\" \"); append(other ?: \"\") \n}\n\n// Immutable types, delegated properties, lazy initialization, string templates\nval greeting by lazy { val doubleEl: String = \"ll\"; \"he${doubleEl}o\" }\n\n// Sealed classes, companion objects\nsealed class to { companion object { val place = \"world\"} }\n\n// Extensions, Unit\nfun String.print() = println(this)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a \"?\" postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: null-check must be performed before using the value. Kotlin provides null-safe operators to help developers:\n\n* {{mono|?.}} ([[safe navigation operator]]) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null.\n* {{mono|?:}} ([[null coalescing operator]]) often referred to as the [[Elvis operator]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\nfun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) {\n    // use of elvis operator\n    val name: String = maybe ?: \"stranger\"\n    println(\"Hello $name\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn example of the use of the safe navigation operator:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// returns null if...\n// - foo() returns null,\n// - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null,\n// - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null.\n// vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null\nfoo()?.bar()?.baz()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin provides support for [[higher order functions]] and [[anonymous functions]] or lambdas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html|website=Kotlin|publisher=Jetbrains|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string, \"lambda\"\n// note that (s: String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type\nfun executeLambda(f: (s: String) -> Unit) {\n    f(\"lambda\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nLambdas are declared using braces, {{mono|{  } }}. If a lambda takes parameters, they are declared within the braces and followed by the {{mono|->}} operator.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// the following statement defines a lambda that takes a single parameter and passes it to the println function\nval l = { c : Any? -> println(c) }\n// lambdas with no parameters may simply be defined using { }\nval l2 = { print(\"no parameters\") }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Tools==\n* [[IntelliJ IDEA]] has plug-in support for Kotlin.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin |title = Kotlin :: JetBrains Plugin Repository |website = Plugins.jetbrains.com |date = 2017-03-31 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> IntelliJ IDEA 15 is the first version to bundle the Kotlin plugin in the IntelliJ Installer, and provide Kotlin support out of the box.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/ |title = What's New in IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1 |website = Jetbrains.com |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref>\n* JetBrains also provides a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html |title = Getting Started with Eclipse Neon \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = Kotlinlang.org |date = 2016-11-10 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse |title = JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse: Kotlin Plugin for Eclipse |publisher = GitHub |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> \n* Integration with common Java build tools is supported including [[Apache Maven]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html |title = Using Maven \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> [[Apache Ant]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-ant.html |title = Using Ant \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> and [[Gradle]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html |title = Using Gradle \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref>\n* [[Android Studio]]  (based on IntelliJ IDEA) has official support for Kotlin, starting from Android Studio 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.android.com/kotlin|title=Kotlin and Android|website=Android Developers}}</ref>\n* [[Emacs]] has a Kotlin Mode in its Melpa package repository.\n* [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] has a plugin maintained on Github.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/udalov/kotlin-vim|publisher=GitHub|title=udalov/kotlin-vim: Kotlin plugin for Vim.

However, the cheek patch of the adult king penguin is a solid bright orange whereas that of the emperor penguin is yellow and white, and the upper chest tends to be more orange and less yellowish in the king species. Both have colourful markings along the side of their lower mandible, but these tend towards pink in emperor penguin and orange in king penguin. Emperor and king penguins typically do not inhabit the same areas in the wild, with the possible exception of vagrants at sea, but the two can readily be distinguished from one another by the king's longer, straighter bill and noticeably sleeker body. The juvenile king penguin with its heavy brown down is completely different in appearance from the mostly grey emperor chick. Once molted of its juvenile plumage, the king chick resembles the adult, but is somewhat less colourful.\n[[File:Aptenodytes patagonicus (AM LB587).jpg|thumb|Mounted skeleton of king penguin ''(Aptenodytes patagonicus)'']]\nKing penguins often breed on the same large, circumpolar islands as at least half of all living penguins, but it is easily distinguished from co-occurring penguins by its much larger size and taller frame, distinctive markings and grizzled sooty-greyish rather than blackish back.<ref name=\"Shirihai 2002\"/><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01775.x|title=Mutual Mate Choice for Colorful Traits in King Penguins|journal=Ethology|year=2010|last1=Nolan|first1=Paul M.|last2=Stephen Dobson|first2=F.|last3=Nicolaus|first3=Marion|last4=Karels|first4=Tim J.|last5=McGraw|first5=Kevin J.|last6=Jouventin|first6=Pierre|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bf5190a99ada8f9a066467cbca4fc9cf88d6a777}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1650/7512|title=Ultraviolet Beak Spots in King and Emperor Penguins|journal=The Condor|volume=107|issue=1|pages=144\u2013150|year=2005|last1=Jouventin|first1=Pierre|last2=Nolan|first2=Paul M.|last3=\u00d6rnborg|first3=Jonas|last4=Dobson|first4=F.

They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is less  than 30%.<ref name=Will54>Williams, p. 54</ref> The unusually long breeding cycle probably contributes to this low rate.<ref name=Will152>Williams, p. 152</ref>\n\nThe king penguin has an extremely prolonged breeding cycle, taking around 14\u201316 months from laying to offspring fledging.<ref name=Will148>Williams, p. 148</ref> Although pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia.<ref name=Stoneh60/> The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will usually arrive earlier. They then return to the sea for around three weeks before coming ashore in November or December.<ref name=Will149>Williams, p. 149</ref>\n\n[[File:Manchot royal MHNT.jpg|thumb|King penguin egg]]\nThe female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white [[egg (biology)|egg]] weighing 300&nbsp;[[gram|g]] (\u2154&nbsp;lb).<ref name=Will150>Williams, p. 150</ref> It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around {{convert|10|x|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Will150/> The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6\u201318&nbsp;days each. Like the closely related  emperor penguin, the king penguin balances the egg on its feet and incubates it in a \"brood pouch\".\n\nHatching may take up to 2\u20133&nbsp;days to complete, and chicks are born [[altricial|semi-altricial and nidicolous]]. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down, and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth.<ref name=Will28/> The ''guard phase'' begins with the hatching of the chick. Similar to the emperor penguin, The young king penguin chick spends its time balanced on its parents' feet, sheltered in the brood pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter.<ref name=Will28>Williams, p. 28</ref> During this time, the parents alternate every 3\u20137&nbsp;days, one guarding the chick while the other forages for food. The guard phase lasts for 30\u201340 days. By then the chick has grown much larger, and is better able to both keep warm and protect itself against most predators. King chicks are very curious and will wander to explore their surroundings. The chicks form a group, called a  [[Cr\u00e8che (zoology)|cr\u00e8che]] and  are watched over by only a few adult birds; most parents  leave their chick in these cr\u00e8ches to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.\n\n[[File:King penguin chick.jpg|thumb|Close-up of king penguin chick on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]]]\n[[File:King Penguins (Youngs).jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|A [[Cr\u00e8che (zoology)|cr\u00e8che]] of king penguin chicks at the [[Gold Harbour]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]]]\nBy April, the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer.\n\nKing penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on [[South Georgia Island]] at [[Salisbury Plain, South Georgia|Salisbury Plain]] holds over 100,000 breeding pairs and the colony at [[St Andrews Bay, South Georgia|St. Andrew's Bay]] over 100,000 birds. Because of the very long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied year-round with both adult birds and chicks.\n\nThe king penguin feeds its chicks by eating fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick's mouth.\n\nBecause of their large size, king penguin chicks take 14\u201316 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone at sea.\n\n==Conservation==\n===Impact of climate change===\n70% of king penguins are expected to abruptly disappear in less than eighty years.<ref name=carbon>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-70-per-cent-king-penguins-could-abruptly-relocate-disappear-by-2100|title=Climate change: 70% of king penguins could 'abruptly relocate or disappear' by 2100|date=2018-02-26|website=Carbon Brief|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Considered sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems, king penguins serve as a key species for understanding the effects of climate change on the marine biome, especially throughout the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic areas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/26/antarcticas-king-penguins-could-disappear-by-the-end-of-the-century|title=Antarctica's king penguins 'could disappear' by the end of the century|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=2018-02-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nKing penguins primarily feed at the [[Antarctic Convergence]], which provides 80% of their food biomass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/26/climate-change-bores-down-on-king-penguin-habitats|title=Climate change threatens most king penguin habitat|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> King penguins currently travel 300\u2013500&nbsp;km over a course of over a week to complete the journey. However, ocean warming could easily move these fronts further away from breeding grounds. Continuous ocean warming could cause the convergence zone to move polewards, away from king penguin breeding sites like the Falklands and the Crozet Islands. It has been suggested that if carbon emissions continue to rise at their current rate, king penguins will need to travel an additional 200&nbsp;km in order to reach their feeding areas. Breeding grounds will also suffer with the rise of emissions. Nearly half of the total population will likely lose their breeding grounds by the year 2100.<ref name=carbon/>\n\n===Resource competition===\nKing penguins are also threatened by large-scale commercial fishing that could deplete their main source of food: myctophid fish. Over 200,000 tons of myctophid fish were commercially exploited by the beginning of the 1990s in the South Georgia region. Ongoing attempts to further develop this fishery for human consumption close to key penguin foraging areas are likely to have negative impacts on food provisioning.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Research and management===\n[[File:Penguins Edinburgh Zoo 2004 SMC.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of king penguin at [[Edinburgh Zoo]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]]]\nThe Pew Charitable Trust recommends the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR) implement \u201clarge-scale, fully protected marine reserves in the waters surrounding Antarctica.\u201d The Trust also recommends precautionary management of the Antarctic krill fishery in order to protect king penguins\u2019 main source of food.

However, the cheek patch of the adult king penguin is a solid bright orange whereas that of the emperor penguin is yellow and white, and the upper chest tends to be more orange and less yellowish in the king species. Both have colourful markings along the side of their lower mandible, but these tend towards pink in emperor penguin and orange in king penguin. Emperor and king penguins typically do not inhabit the same areas in the wild, with the possible exception of vagrants at sea, but the two can readily be distinguished from one another by the king's longer, straighter bill and noticeably sleeker body. The juvenile king penguin with its heavy brown down is completely different in appearance from the mostly grey emperor chick. Once molted of its juvenile plumage, the king chick resembles the adult, but is somewhat less colourful.\n[[File:Aptenodytes patagonicus (AM LB587).jpg|thumb|Mounted skeleton of king penguin ''(Aptenodytes patagonicus)'']]\nKing penguins often breed on the same large, circumpolar islands as at least half of all living penguins, but it is easily distinguished from co-occurring penguins by its much larger size and taller frame, distinctive markings and grizzled sooty-greyish rather than blackish back.<ref name=\"Shirihai 2002\"/><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01775.x|title=Mutual Mate Choice for Colorful Traits in King Penguins|journal=Ethology|year=2010|last1=Nolan|first1=Paul M.|last2=Stephen Dobson|first2=F.|last3=Nicolaus|first3=Marion|last4=Karels|first4=Tim J.|last5=McGraw|first5=Kevin J.|last6=Jouventin|first6=Pierre|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bf5190a99ada8f9a066467cbca4fc9cf88d6a777}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1650/7512|title=Ultraviolet Beak Spots in King and Emperor Penguins|journal=The Condor|volume=107|issue=1|pages=144\u2013150|year=2005|last1=Jouventin|first1=Pierre|last2=Nolan|first2=Paul M.|last3=\u00d6rnborg|first3=Jonas|last4=Dobson|first4=F.

It measures around {{convert|10|x|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Will150/> The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6\u201318&nbsp;days each. Like the closely related  emperor penguin, the king penguin balances the egg on its feet and incubates it in a \"brood pouch\".\n\nHatching may take up to 2\u20133&nbsp;days to complete, and chicks are born [[altricial|semi-altricial and nidicolous]]. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down, and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth.<ref name=Will28/> The ''guard phase'' begins with the hatching of the chick. Similar to the emperor penguin, The young king penguin chick spends its time balanced on its parents' feet, sheltered in the brood pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter.<ref name=Will28>Williams, p. 28</ref> During this time, the parents alternate every 3\u20137&nbsp;days, one guarding the chick while the other forages for food. The guard phase lasts for 30\u201340 days. By then the chick has grown much larger, and is better able to both keep warm and protect itself against most predators. King chicks are very curious and will wander to explore their surroundings. The chicks form a group, called a  [[Cr\u00e8che (zoology)|cr\u00e8che]] and  are watched over by only a few adult birds; most parents  leave their chick in these cr\u00e8ches to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.\n\n[[File:King penguin chick.jpg|thumb|Close-up of king penguin chick on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]]]\n[[File:King Penguins (Youngs).jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|A [[Cr\u00e8che (zoology)|cr\u00e8che]] of king penguin chicks at the [[Gold Harbour]], [[South Georgia]]]]\nBy April, the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer.\n\nKing penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on [[South Georgia Island]] at [[Salisbury Plain, South Georgia|Salisbury Plain]] holds over 100,000 breeding pairs and the colony at [[St Andrews Bay, South Georgia|St. Andrew's Bay]] over 100,000 birds. Because of the very long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied year-round with both adult birds and chicks.\n\nThe king penguin feeds its chicks by eating fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick's mouth.\n\nBecause of their large size, king penguin chicks take 14\u201316 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone at sea.\n\n==Conservation==\n===Impact of climate change===\n70% of king penguins are expected to abruptly disappear in less than eighty years.<ref name=carbon>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-70-per-cent-king-penguins-could-abruptly-relocate-disappear-by-2100|title=Climate change: 70% of king penguins could 'abruptly relocate or disappear' by 2100|date=2018-02-26|website=Carbon Brief|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Considered sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems, king penguins serve as a key species for understanding the effects of climate change on the marine biome, especially throughout the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic areas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/26/antarcticas-king-penguins-could-disappear-by-the-end-of-the-century|title=Antarctica's king penguins 'could disappear' by the end of the century|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=2018-02-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nKing penguins primarily feed at the [[Antarctic Convergence]], which provides 80% of their food biomass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/26/climate-change-bores-down-on-king-penguin-habitats|title=Climate change threatens most king penguin habitat|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> King penguins currently travel 300\u2013500&nbsp;km over a course of over a week to complete the journey. However, ocean warming could easily move these fronts further away from breeding grounds. Continuous ocean warming could cause the convergence zone to move polewards, away from king penguin breeding sites like the Falklands and the Crozet Islands. It has been suggested that if carbon emissions continue to rise at their current rate, king penguins will need to travel an additional 200&nbsp;km in order to reach their feeding areas. Breeding grounds will also suffer with the rise of emissions. Nearly half of the total population will likely lose their breeding grounds by the year 2100.<ref name=carbon/>\n\n===Resource competition===\nKing penguins are also threatened by large-scale commercial fishing that could deplete their main source of food: myctophid fish. Over 200,000 tons of myctophid fish were commercially exploited by the beginning of the 1990s in the South Georgia region. Ongoing attempts to further develop this fishery for human consumption close to key penguin foraging areas are likely to have negative impacts on food provisioning.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Research and management===\n[[File:Penguins Edinburgh Zoo 2004 SMC.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of king penguin at [[Edinburgh Zoo]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]]]\nThe Pew Charitable Trust recommends the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR) implement \u201clarge-scale, fully protected marine reserves in the waters surrounding Antarctica.\u201d The Trust also recommends precautionary management of the Antarctic krill fishery in order to protect king penguins\u2019 main source of food.

[[Personal armour]] is used to protect soldiers and [[war animal]]s. [[Vehicle armour]] is used on [[warship]]s and [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s.\n\nA second use of the term '''armour''' describes [[Division (military)#Armoured division|armoured forces]], [[Armour#Armoured fighting vehicles|armoured weapons]], and their role in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] and their weapons came to be referred to collectively as \"armour\".\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Paris bordone 016.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Gentleman in armour with two pages.'' [[Paris Bordone]].]]\nThe word \"armour\" began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of [[Old French language|Old French]]. It is dated from 1297 as a \"mail, defensive covering worn in combat\". The word originates from the Old French {{lang|fro|armure}}, itself derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|armatura}} meaning \"arms and/or equipment\", with the root {{lang|la|armare}} meaning \"arms or gear\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of armour in English |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/armour |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal ==\n{{Main|Body armor}}\n\nArmour has been used throughout [[recorded history]]. It has been made from a variety of materials, beginning with the use of leathers or fabrics as protection<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/armour-protective-clothing]</ref> and evolving through [[Mail (armour)|mail]] and metal plate into today's modern [[composite armour|composites]]. For much of [[military history]] the manufacture of metal personal armour has dominated the technology and employment of armour. Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood [[laminate|lamination]], mining, [[Refining (metallurgy)|metal refining]], vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the [[industrial revolution]], and furthered commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. Armour was the single most influential factor in the development of [[firearm]]s, which in turn revolutionised warfare.\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|The [[Dendra panoply]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] armour, c. 1400 BC]]\n\nSignificant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of its production. For instance, [[plate armour]] first appeared in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]] when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. Also, modern militaries usually do not equip their forces with the best armour available because it would be prohibitively expensive. At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.\n\nWell-known armour types in [[European history]] include the [[lorica hamata]], [[lorica squamata]], and the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legion]]s, the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914\u201315). The [[samurai]] warriors of feudal Japan utilised [[Japanese armour|many types of armour]] for hundreds of years up to the 19th century.\n\n==== Early ====\n[[Cuirass]]es and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.<ref>Farris 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dCNioYQ1HfsC&pg=PA75 p. 75]</ref> ''Tank\u014d'', worn by foot soldiers and ''keik\u014d'', worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early [[Japanese armour]] constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. Japanese lamellar armour (''keiko'') passed through Korea and reached Japan around the 5th century.<ref>Robinson 2002, p. 10</ref> These early Japanese lamellar armours took the form of a sleeveless jacket, leggings and a helmet.<ref>Robinson 2002, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nArmour did not always cover all of the body; sometimes no more than a helmet and leg plates were worn. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a large shield. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).<ref>Fagan 2004, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn East Asia many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures, including [[scale armour]], [[lamellar armour]], [[laminar armour]], [[plated mail]], [[Chainmail|mail]], [[plate armour]] and [[brigandine]]. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for \"important\" body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.\n\n[[Mail (armour)|Mail]], sometimes called \"chainmail\", made of interlocking iron rings is believed to have first appeared some time after 300 BC. Its invention is credited to the [[Celts]]; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are thought to have adopted their design.<ref>Gabriel 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA79 p. 79]</ref>\n\nGradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.\n\n===== 13th to 18th century Europe =====\n{{see|Components of medieval armour}}\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr Siegel 2.jpg|thumb|A royal [[equestrian seal]] (early 15th century) depicting [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], Prince of [[Wales]], in full armour, riding his full barded steed, they are both wearing gold dragon headgear symbolising Arthurian legend]]\n\nEarly plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th\u201315th century, were made of iron. Iron armour could be [[Carburising|carburised]] or [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.<ref>Williams 2003, pp. 740\u201341.</ref> Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger [[Bloomery|blooms]]. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 55</ref>\n\nThe small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.\n\n[[File:MET Armures.jpg|thumb|Heavily armoured riders and their [[barding|barded]] [[war horse]]s, 16th century]]\nProbably the most recognised style of armour in the world became the [[plate armour]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries.\n\nBy about 1400 the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 53.</ref> Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour.\n\nIn the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14\u201315th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15&nbsp;kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25&nbsp;kg.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 916</ref> The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.\n\nIn the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.\n\nThe horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]]. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.\n\n==== Later ====\n[[File:Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor MET DT780.jpg|thumb|''Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor'', c. 1510, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elements_of_a_Light-Cavalry_Armor_MET_DT780.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]\nGradually, starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers.\n\nBack and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European (heavy) cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, [[musket]]s could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. In Japan armour continued to be used until the end of the samurai era, with the last major fighting in which armour was used happening in 1868.<ref>Robinson 1951, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> [[Japanese armour|Samurai armour]] had one last short lived use in 1877 during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]].<ref>Robinson 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kh-to448NTEC&pg=PA208 p. 208]</ref>\n\nThough the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely\u2014some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.<ref>Stewart, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\nAt the start of World War I, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against [[sabre]]s and light [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s, unlike the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.\n\n==== Present ====\nToday, [[ballistic vest]]s, also known as [[flak jacket]]s, made of ballistic cloth (e.g. [[kevlar]], [[dyneema]], [[twaron]], [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|spectra]] etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police forces, [[security guard|security staff]], [[prison officer|corrections officers]] and some branches of the military.\n\nThe US Army has adopted [[Interceptor body armour]], which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) in the chest, sides, and back of the armour.

The first [[tank]]s were produced during World War I. Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the First World War.\n\nIn modern ground forces' usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced [[light infantry]] in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s serve the historic role of both the [[heavy cavalry|battle cavalry]], [[light cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, and belong to the armoured branch.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Ships ====\n{{further|Warship}}\n[[File:HMS Warrior (1860).jpg|left|thumb|[[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']] during her third commission between 1867 and 1871]]\n\nThe first [[ironclad]] battleship, with iron armour over a wooden hull, ''[[French battleship La Gloire|La Gloire]]'', was launched by the [[French Navy]] in 1859<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 73\u201374</ref> prompting the British [[Royal Navy]] to build a counter. The following year they launched [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']], which was twice the size and had iron armour over an iron hull. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first battle between two ironclads]] took place in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the [[Ship of the line|unarmoured line-of-battle ship]] as the most powerful warship afloat.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 86.</ref>\n\nIronclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, coastal defence ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea){{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.\n\nThe rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armoured cruiser]]s.\n\n==== Trains ====\n[[File:Wagon pancerny s.jpg|thumb|upright|An armoured train from 1915]]\n\n[[Armoured train]]s saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u201381 and 1899\u20131902),the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u20131921); the [[World War I|First]] (1914\u20131918) and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (1939\u20131945) and the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920).\n\n[[Armored car (military)|Armoured cars]] saw use during World wars 1 and 2.\n\nDuring the [[Second Boer War]] on 15 November 1899, [[Winston Churchill]], then a war-correspondent, was travelling on board an armoured train when it was ambushed by Boer commandos. Churchill and many of the train's garrison were captured, though many others escaped, including wounded placed on the train's engine.\n\n==== Armoured fighting vehicles ====\n{{Main|Vehicle armour|Armoured fighting vehicle}}\n\nAncient [[siege engines]] were usually protected by wooden armour, often covered with wet hides or thin metal to prevent being easily burned.\n\nMedieval [[war wagon]]s were horse-drawn wagons that were similarly armoured.  These contained guns or crossbowmen that could fire through gun-slits.\n\nThe first modern [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] were [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], developed circa 1900.  These started as ordinary wheeled motor-cars protected by iron shields, typically mounting a [[machine gun]].<ref>Macksey, Kenneth (1980). ''The Guinness Book of Tank Facts and Feats''. Guinness Superlatives Limited, {{ISBN|0-85112-204-3}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] during on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] spurred the development of the [[tank]].  It was envisioned as an armoured machine that could advance under fire from enemy rifles and machine guns, and respond with its own heavy guns. It utilized [[caterpillar track]]s to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.\n\n==== Aircraft ====\nWith the development of effective [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in the period before the Second World War, military pilots, once the \"knights of the air\" during the First World War, became far more vulnerable to ground fire. As a response armour plating was added to aircraft to protect aircrew and vulnerable areas such as fuel tanks and engine.\n\n==== Present ====\n[[File:Abrams-transparent.png|thumb|left|The [[United States Military|US Military]]'s [[M1 Abrams]] [[Main battle tank|MBT]] uses [[composite armour|composite]], [[reactive armour|reactive]], and [[cage armour]]]]\n[[Image:Pannzerung plastische deformation.png|thumb|right|Swebor-brand high-strength low alloy steel plate, showing both sides, after [[plastic deformation]] from defeating [[projectile]]s in [[ballistics]] testing. Note: When exposed to fire, steel first expands and then loses its strength, exceeding critical temperature at 538\u00b0C or 1000\u00b0F per [https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119] unless treated with [[fireproofing]].]]\n\nTank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder [[Composite armour|composites]], but also [[reactive armour]] designed to defeat [[shaped charge]]s. As a result of this, the [[main battle tank]] (MBT) conceived in the [[Cold War]] era can survive multiple [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The [[light tank]]s that were the last descendants of the [[light cavalry]] during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world's militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.\n\nThe [[armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) was devised during World War I. It allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured [[half-track]]s in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery [[Air burst|burst]] fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) when properties of an armoured personnel carrier and a [[light tank]] were combined in one vehicle.\n\nNaval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[bomb]]s and [[torpedo]]es. Passive defence naval armour is limited to [[kevlar]] or steel (either single layer or as [[spaced armour]]) protecting particularly vital areas from the effects of nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely prevent penetration by [[anti-ship missile]]s, they depend more on destroying an incoming missile before it hits, or causing it to miss its target.\n\nAlthough the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the [[Korean War]], it re-emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what became the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] dedicated anti-armour and [[ground-attack aircraft]] that first saw action in the [[Gulf War]].\n\n[[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]] are often required to defeat [[ballistics]] from small arms as well as projectiles from [[Bushing (electrical)|transformer bushings]] and [[lightning arrester]]s, which form part of large electrical [[transformer]]s, per [https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=850 NFPA 850]. Such fire barriers may be designed to inherently function as armour, or may be  [[passive fire protection]] materials ''augmented by armour'', where care must be taken to ensure that the armour's reaction to fire does not cause issues with regards to the fire barrier being armoured to defeat explosions and projectiles in addition to fire, especially since both functions must be provided simultaneously, meaning they must be fire-tested together to provide realistic evidence of fitness for purpose.\n\n[[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|Combat drones]] use little to no vehicular armour as they are not manned vessels, this results in them being lightweight and small in size.\n\n== Animal armour ==\n\n=== Horse armour ===\n{{Main|Barding}}\n\n[[Image:Dresden-Zwinger-Armoury-Armor.02.JPG|right|200px|thumb|A sixteenth-century knight with a horse in full barding]]\n'''Barding''' (also spelled ''bard'' or ''barb'') is [[body armour]] for [[Horses in warfare|war horses]], especially as used by European [[knight]]s.\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]] as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was exploited by the [[Scotland|Scots]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in the 14th century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the [[England|English]] at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] in the same century where [[English longbow|longbowmen]] shot horses and the then dismounted [[France|French]] knights were killed by [[heavy infantry]]. Barding developed as a response to such events.\n\nExamples of armour for horses could be found as far back as [[classical antiquity]]. [[Cataphracts]], with [[scale armour]] for both rider and horse, are believed by many historians to have influenced the later European knights, via contact with the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Nell, Grant S. 1995\">Nell, Grant S. (1995) ''The Savaran: The Original Knights''.

[[Personal armour]] is used to protect soldiers and [[war animal]]s. [[Vehicle armour]] is used on [[warship]]s and [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s.\n\nA second use of the term '''armour''' describes [[Division (military)#Armoured division|armoured forces]], [[Armour#Armoured fighting vehicles|armoured weapons]], and their role in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] and their weapons came to be referred to collectively as \"armour\".\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Paris bordone 016.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Gentleman in armour with two pages.'' [[Paris Bordone]].]]\nThe word \"armour\" began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of [[Old French language|Old French]]. It is dated from 1297 as a \"mail, defensive covering worn in combat\". The word originates from the Old French {{lang|fro|armure}}, itself derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|armatura}} meaning \"arms and/or equipment\", with the root {{lang|la|armare}} meaning \"arms or gear\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of armour in English |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/armour |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal ==\n{{Main|Body armor}}\n\nArmour has been used throughout [[recorded history]]. It has been made from a variety of materials, beginning with the use of leathers or fabrics as protection<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/armour-protective-clothing]</ref> and evolving through [[Mail (armour)|mail]] and metal plate into today's modern [[composite armour|composites]]. For much of [[military history]] the manufacture of metal personal armour has dominated the technology and employment of armour. Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood [[laminate|lamination]], mining, [[Refining (metallurgy)|metal refining]], vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the [[industrial revolution]], and furthered commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. Armour was the single most influential factor in the development of [[firearm]]s, which in turn revolutionised warfare.\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|The [[Dendra panoply]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] armour, c. 1400 BC]]\n\nSignificant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of its production. For instance, [[plate armour]] first appeared in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]] when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. Also, modern militaries usually do not equip their forces with the best armour available because it would be prohibitively expensive. At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.\n\nWell-known armour types in [[European history]] include the [[lorica hamata]], [[lorica squamata]], and the [[lorica segmentata]] of the [[Roman legion]]s, the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914\u201315). The [[samurai]] warriors of feudal Japan utilised [[Japanese armour|many types of armour]] for hundreds of years up to the 19th century.\n\n==== Early ====\n[[Cuirass]]es and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.<ref>Farris 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dCNioYQ1HfsC&pg=PA75 p. 75]</ref> ''Tank\u014d'', worn by foot soldiers and ''keik\u014d'', worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early [[Japanese armour]] constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. Japanese lamellar armour (''keiko'') passed through Korea and reached Japan around the 5th century.<ref>Robinson 2002, p. 10</ref> These early Japanese lamellar armours took the form of a sleeveless jacket, leggings and a helmet.<ref>Robinson 2002, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nArmour did not always cover all of the body; sometimes no more than a helmet and leg plates were worn. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a large shield. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).<ref>Fagan 2004, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn East Asia many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures, including [[scale armour]], [[lamellar armour]], [[laminar armour]], [[plated mail]], [[Chainmail|mail]], [[plate armour]] and [[brigandine]]. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for \"important\" body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.\n\n[[Mail (armour)|Mail]], sometimes called \"chainmail\", made of interlocking iron rings is believed to have first appeared some time after 300 BC. Its invention is credited to the [[Celts]]; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are thought to have adopted their design.<ref>Gabriel 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA79 p. 79]</ref>\n\nGradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.\n\n===== 13th to 18th century Europe =====\n{{see|Components of medieval armour}}\n[[File:Owain Glyndwr Siegel 2.jpg|thumb|A royal [[equestrian seal]] (early 15th century) depicting [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], Prince of [[Wales]], in full armour, riding his full barded steed, they are both wearing gold dragon headgear symbolising Arthurian legend]]\n\nEarly plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th\u201315th century, were made of iron. Iron armour could be [[Carburising|carburised]] or [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.<ref>Williams 2003, pp. 740\u201341.</ref> Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger [[Bloomery|blooms]]. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 55</ref>\n\nThe small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.\n\n[[File:MET Armures.jpg|thumb|Heavily armoured riders and their [[barding|barded]] [[war horse]]s, 16th century]]\nProbably the most recognised style of armour in the world became the [[plate armour]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries.\n\nBy about 1400 the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 53.</ref> Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour.\n\nIn the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14\u201315th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15&nbsp;kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25&nbsp;kg.<ref>Williams 2003, p. 916</ref> The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.\n\nIn the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.\n\nThe horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]]. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.\n\n==== Later ====\n[[File:Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor MET DT780.jpg|thumb|''Elements of a Light-Cavalry Armor'', c. 1510, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elements_of_a_Light-Cavalry_Armor_MET_DT780.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]\nGradually, starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers.\n\nBack and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European (heavy) cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, [[musket]]s could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. In Japan armour continued to be used until the end of the samurai era, with the last major fighting in which armour was used happening in 1868.<ref>Robinson 1951, {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> [[Japanese armour|Samurai armour]] had one last short lived use in 1877 during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]].<ref>Robinson 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kh-to448NTEC&pg=PA208 p. 208]</ref>\n\nThough the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely\u2014some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.<ref>Stewart, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\nAt the start of World War I, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against [[sabre]]s and light [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s, unlike the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.\n\n==== Present ====\nToday, [[ballistic vest]]s, also known as [[flak jacket]]s, made of ballistic cloth (e.g. [[kevlar]], [[dyneema]], [[twaron]], [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|spectra]] etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police forces, [[security guard|security staff]], [[prison officer|corrections officers]] and some branches of the military.\n\nThe US Army has adopted [[Interceptor body armour]], which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) in the chest, sides, and back of the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of ammunition including 3 hits from a [[7.62\u00d751 NATO]] AP round at a range of {{convert|10|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>ArmorUP</ref> [[Dragon Skin]] is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results. As of 2019, it has been deemed too heavy, expensive, and unreliable, in comparison to more tradition plates, and it is outdated in protection compared to modern US IOTV armour, and even in testing was deemed a downgrade from the IBA. \n\nThe British Armed Forces also have their own armour, known as Osprey. It is rated to the same general equivalent standard as the US counterpart, the [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest]], and now the [[Soldier Plate Carrier System]] and [[Modular Tactical Vest]].\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces also have armour, known as the 6B43, all the way to 6B45, depending on variant.\n\nTheir armor runs on the GOST system, which, due to regional conditions, has resulted in a technically higher protective level overall. \n<br /><center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Ancient German armour helmet.jpg|Medieval Germanic helmet.\nFile:Medieval horse armour.jpg|Medieval horse armour on display at [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]] in [[Qatar]]. \n</gallery>\n<gallery>\nFile:Late medieval armour complete (gothic plate armour).jpg|Plate armour\nFile:January 20 riot cops D.C..jpg|Riot police with body protection against physical impact.

Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the First World War.\n\nIn modern ground forces' usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of [[armoured warfare]], [[mechanised infantry]] were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced [[light infantry]] in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s serve the historic role of both the [[heavy cavalry|battle cavalry]], [[light cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, and belong to the armoured branch.\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Ships ====\n{{further|Warship}}\n[[File:HMS Warrior (1860).jpg|left|thumb|[[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']] during her third commission between 1867 and 1871]]\n\nThe first [[ironclad]] battleship, with iron armour over a wooden hull, ''[[French battleship La Gloire|La Gloire]]'', was launched by the [[French Navy]] in 1859<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 73\u201374</ref> prompting the British [[Royal Navy]] to build a counter. The following year they launched [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']], which was twice the size and had iron armour over an iron hull. After the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|first battle between two ironclads]] took place in 1862 during the [[American Civil War]], it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the [[Ship of the line|unarmoured line-of-battle ship]] as the most powerful warship afloat.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 86.</ref>\n\nIronclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas [[battleship]]s, coastal defence ships, and long-range [[cruiser]]s. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea){{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.\n\nThe rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the [[naval ram|ram]] or the [[torpedo]], which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ''ironclad'' dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or [[armoured cruiser]]s.\n\n==== Trains ====\n[[File:Wagon pancerny s.jpg|thumb|upright|An armoured train from 1915]]\n\n[[Armoured train]]s saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u201381 and 1899\u20131902),the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u20131921); the [[World War I|First]] (1914\u20131918) and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] (1939\u20131945) and the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920).\n\n[[Armored car (military)|Armoured cars]] saw use during World wars 1 and 2.\n\nDuring the [[Second Boer War]] on 15 November 1899, [[Winston Churchill]], then a war-correspondent, was travelling on board an armoured train when it was ambushed by Boer commandos. Churchill and many of the train's garrison were captured, though many others escaped, including wounded placed on the train's engine.\n\n==== Armoured fighting vehicles ====\n{{Main|Vehicle armour|Armoured fighting vehicle}}\n\nAncient [[siege engines]] were usually protected by wooden armour, often covered with wet hides or thin metal to prevent being easily burned.\n\nMedieval [[war wagon]]s were horse-drawn wagons that were similarly armoured.  These contained guns or crossbowmen that could fire through gun-slits.\n\nThe first modern [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] were [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], developed circa 1900.  These started as ordinary wheeled motor-cars protected by iron shields, typically mounting a [[machine gun]].<ref>Macksey, Kenneth (1980). ''The Guinness Book of Tank Facts and Feats''. Guinness Superlatives Limited, {{ISBN|0-85112-204-3}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] during on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] spurred the development of the [[tank]].  It was envisioned as an armoured machine that could advance under fire from enemy rifles and machine guns, and respond with its own heavy guns. It utilized [[caterpillar track]]s to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.\n\n==== Aircraft ====\nWith the development of effective [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in the period before the Second World War, military pilots, once the \"knights of the air\" during the First World War, became far more vulnerable to ground fire. As a response armour plating was added to aircraft to protect aircrew and vulnerable areas such as fuel tanks and engine.\n\n==== Present ====\n[[File:Abrams-transparent.png|thumb|left|The [[United States Military|US Military]]'s [[M1 Abrams]] [[Main battle tank|MBT]] uses [[composite armour|composite]], [[reactive armour|reactive]], and [[cage armour]]]]\n[[Image:Pannzerung plastische deformation.png|thumb|right|Swebor-brand high-strength low alloy steel plate, showing both sides, after [[plastic deformation]] from defeating [[projectile]]s in [[ballistics]] testing. Note: When exposed to fire, steel first expands and then loses its strength, exceeding critical temperature at 538\u00b0C or 1000\u00b0F per [https://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm ASTM E119] unless treated with [[fireproofing]].]]\n\nTank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder [[Composite armour|composites]], but also [[reactive armour]] designed to defeat [[shaped charge]]s. As a result of this, the [[main battle tank]] (MBT) conceived in the [[Cold War]] era can survive multiple [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The [[light tank]]s that were the last descendants of the [[light cavalry]] during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world's militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.\n\nThe [[armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) was devised during World War I. It allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured [[half-track]]s in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery [[Air burst|burst]] fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an [[Infantry fighting vehicle]] (IFV) when properties of an armoured personnel carrier and a [[light tank]] were combined in one vehicle.\n\nNaval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], [[bomb]]s and [[torpedo]]es. Passive defence naval armour is limited to [[kevlar]] or steel (either single layer or as [[spaced armour]]) protecting particularly vital areas from the effects of nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely prevent penetration by [[anti-ship missile]]s, they depend more on destroying an incoming missile before it hits, or causing it to miss its target.\n\nAlthough the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the [[Korean War]], it re-emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what became the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] dedicated anti-armour and [[ground-attack aircraft]] that first saw action in the [[Gulf War]].\n\n[[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]] are often required to defeat [[ballistics]] from small arms as well as projectiles from [[Bushing (electrical)|transformer bushings]] and [[lightning arrester]]s, which form part of large electrical [[transformer]]s, per [https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=850 NFPA 850]. Such fire barriers may be designed to inherently function as armour, or may be  [[passive fire protection]] materials ''augmented by armour'', where care must be taken to ensure that the armour's reaction to fire does not cause issues with regards to the fire barrier being armoured to defeat explosions and projectiles in addition to fire, especially since both functions must be provided simultaneously, meaning they must be fire-tested together to provide realistic evidence of fitness for purpose.\n\n[[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|Combat drones]] use little to no vehicular armour as they are not manned vessels, this results in them being lightweight and small in size.\n\n== Animal armour ==\n\n=== Horse armour ===\n{{Main|Barding}}\n\n[[Image:Dresden-Zwinger-Armoury-Armor.02.JPG|right|200px|thumb|A sixteenth-century knight with a horse in full barding]]\n'''Barding''' (also spelled ''bard'' or ''barb'') is [[body armour]] for [[Horses in warfare|war horses]], especially as used by European [[knight]]s.\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]] as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was exploited by the [[Scotland|Scots]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in the 14th century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the [[England|English]] at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] in the same century where [[English longbow|longbowmen]] shot horses and the then dismounted [[France|French]] knights were killed by [[heavy infantry]]. Barding developed as a response to such events.\n\nExamples of armour for horses could be found as far back as [[classical antiquity]]. [[Cataphracts]], with [[scale armour]] for both rider and horse, are believed by many historians to have influenced the later European knights, via contact with the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name=\"Nell, Grant S. 1995\">Nell, Grant S. (1995) ''The Savaran: The Original Knights''. University of Oklahoma Press.</ref>\n\nSurviving period examples of barding are rare; however, complete sets are on display at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]],<ref>[http://philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/309965.html Horse Armor of Duke Ulrich of W\u00fcrttemberg] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]</ref> the [[Wallace Collection]] in [[London]], the [[Royal Armouries]] in [[Leeds]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].  Horse armour could be made in whole or in part of [[cuir bouilli]] (hardened leather), but surviving examples of this are especially rare.<ref>Phyrr et al., 57\u201359</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Armour}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [[Battledress]]\n* [[Bomb suit]]\n* [[Linothorax]]\n* [[Powered exoskeleton]]\n* [[Rolled homogeneous armour]]\n* [[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* \"Ballistic Protection Levels.\" BulletproofME.com Body Armor.

The club's first ever league game, playing in the [[Football League Second Division|2nd Division]]'s [[1907\u201308 in English football#Second Division|1907-8 season]], saw them losing 1\u20130 at home to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 3 September 1907. The first win came a few days later on 7 September 1907 at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s [[Baseball Ground]], by a score of 1\u20130. When they eventually found their feet in the division they impressed, ending up only three points short of promotion in fourth place. However, this was the best season they had in their 21-year stay in that division, and after only winning 13 out of 42 games in the [[1927\u201328 in English football|1927\u201328 season]] Fulham were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|3rd Division South]], which was created in 1920.\n\nA highlight of that first season was an 8\u20133 away win at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in an [[FA Cup]] game. The club actually managed to reach the semi-finals of that tournament, where they were humbled 6\u20130 by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game.<ref>See the FA Cup-specific page in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501164543/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/FACupHistory/RemarkableFailure.aspx club history] on the official website</ref> A couple of years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the [[1909\u201310 in English football|1909\u201310 season]].\n\nDuring this period, businessman and politician [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. When he rejected an offer from businessman [[Gus Mears]] to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal.\n\nAfter finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the 3rd Division South, Fulham won the division in the [[1931\u201332 in English football|1931\u201332 season]]. In doing so, they beat [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] 10\u20132, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The [[1932\u201333 in English football|next season]], they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336 season]]. On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.\n\nLeague and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national [[Football League War Cup]] and a [[London War Cup]] up for grabs. Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for [[1946\u201347 in English football|1946\u201347]]. In [[1948\u201349 in English football|the third season]] of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win-loss-draw record of 24\u20139\u20139 (identical to that which won them the 3rd Division South 17 years previously).\n\n== 1949\u20131970: Reaching the top flight ==\nPromotion to the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the [[1951\u201352 in English football|1951\u201352 season]], winning only 8 of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Delorimier Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] in front of 29,000 spectators.<ref>[http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm Celtic Programmes Online - Tours of the USA and Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1949\u201352\n| Football League ''[[Football League First Division|Div.

Also joining Fulham in 1958 was [[Graham Leggat]], who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer. In the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360 season]], they achieved tenth position in the 1st Division, which until finishing ninth in the [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League]] was their highest ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.\n\nBy this time the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at [[Craven Cottage]],<ref>According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx club history] at the official website</ref> despite struggling in the League. The club experienced several close escapes from relegation none more spectacular than in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]]. On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham had just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually the club suffered relegation in the [[1967\u201368 in English football|1967\u201368 season]], having won just 10 out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only 7 in 42, the club were again relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|3rd Division]]. (Note that this is not the same as the 3rd Division South, as the regional 3rd Divisions had been removed with the 1959 creation of the [[Football League Fourth Division|4th Division]]).\n\nIt is impossible to talk about Fulham's history without mentioning probably the single most influential character in Fulham's history, [[Johnny Haynes]].<ref>This is of course somewhat subjective, but he is the first player mentioned in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx Great names] section of the club's history on the official website.

This spell also saw Fulham invited to the not particularly prestigious [[Anglo-Italian Cup]], which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1973. Thus started off a period of high-profile signings for the club under [[Alec Stock]] in the mid-1970s, including [[Alan Mullery]] and [[Bobby Moore]]. The reward of this was their only ever FA Cup final in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club then lost to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the final. This gained the club qualification to another low-key European tournament, the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]], where they made the final, losing to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].\n\nThat run in the FA Cup saw the setting of an improbable record, that of the most games needed to reach the final, Fulham playing 11 games including replays. In the buildup to the 12th game, the Wembley final, Tony Rees and the Cottagers released a single, ''\"Viva el Fulham\"'' (based on [[Manolo Escobar]]'s ''\"Y viva Espa\u00f1a\"'') which is still played (and occasionally chanted) at Fulham games. It reached number 46 in the Pop Charts in 1975.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1969\u201371\n| Football League ''[[Football League Third Division|Div.

[[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play 1st Division football and play for [[England national football team|England]], rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.\n\nThe hangover from this meant the club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 in the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380 season]], followed by [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]]'s sacking in October 1980, replaced by [[Malcolm Macdonald]]. With a strong squad during his 1980\u20131984 period in charge (with players such as [[Ray Houghton]], [[Tony Gale]], [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]], [[Gerry Peyton]] and [[Ray Lewington]]), they won promotion again in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]] back to Division 2. In 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now [[London Broncos#2006\u20132011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]], designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club. Then called Fulham Rugby League, they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.\n\nFulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], losing 1\u20130 to Derby County away on the last day of the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] \u2013 although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a pitch invasion. The side which had shown so much promise was gradually sold off and broken up as the club had debts to pay off, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 with the breakdown of an ill-advised merger attempt with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. The intervention of the Football League and the emergence of a concortum fronted by ex-player [[Jimmy Hill]] allowed the club to stay in business as a re-structured Fulham FC (1987) Ltd. In the same year, the club took part in the longest penalty decider recorded to that time \u2013 it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in a [[Football League Trophy|Freight Rover Trophy]] match.\n\nIn 1992, the foundation of the [[Premier League]], and the resignation of the entire top division from the Football League, saw Fulham elevated to the 2nd Division. The club, however, was relegated from that to the new 3rd Division after a poor [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]], following which [[Ian Branfoot]] was appointed manager.\n\n== 1994\u201397: Fulham start rise from fourth tier ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1994\u201397\n| Football League ''Div.

Branfoot was soon sacked as team manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while.\n\nIn February 1996, the club appointed then-player [[Micky Adams]] as manager, and it was in the summer of that year that his revolution really took off. That signalled the start of the new era of Fulham. Adams was appointed as manager and oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of what little relegation danger was present (as it turned out, no team was even relegated from the league that season). The next campaign, he engineered a complete turnaround in form and his side, captained by [[Simon Morgan]], finished second \u2013 only missing out on first place because the League had dropped the old \"goal difference\" to decide tied positions, system in favour of a \"goals scored\" tally. (While Fulham's goal difference was one better than that of champions [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], they scored 12 fewer goals.) This was somewhat ironic, as the club's then chairman Jimmy Hill had successfully argued that goals scored should decide positions of teams tied on points at the Football League's 1992 AGM.\n\n== 1997\u20132001: Al Fayed's revolution ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1997\u201399\n| Football League ''Div.

Frenchman [[Jean Tigana]] was put in charge and with only two changes to the first team, including [[France|French]] striker [[Louis Saha]], he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in [[2000\u201301 in English football#Football League First Division|the 2000\u201301 season]] in emphatic style, scoring 90 goals in 46 games. That gave Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968, which had only taken four years \u2013 one shorter than Al Fayed's pledge. During this season, club captain and subsequent manager [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] was involved in a car crash which put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw many players come and go, and the only player to play for the club in all four leagues was [[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]], indeed he is one of few players to ever have played in four divisions of professional football with one team.\n\n== 2001\u201307: Premiership years ==\nDespite some scepticism,<ref>Such as those [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/sports_talk/1492984.stm at the BBC].</ref> Fulham were widely tipped to take the Premier League by storm, with many pundits<ref>Such as those in [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-77218866 The Mirror].</ref> predicting a challenge for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] or even [[UEFA Champions League]] places, but their [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|first Premier League season]] was largely underwhelming; despite a couple of good games and some flashes of brilliance, the end product was a respectable 13th-place finish. Fulham remain the only team in this millennium to host top-flight football with some standing areas. Due to [[Taylor report|restrictions on standings]], Fulham decamped to [[Loftus Road]] during the 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 seasons while their own stadium was rebuilt, but then returned to Craven Cottage.\n\n[[File:Fulham v Pompey (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (White) playing [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] (Blue) in front of Fulham fans in the Hammersmith End.]] \nThe [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|following season]] saw Fulham dangerously close to the relegation zone, and chairman Mohammed Al Fayed told Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. But an awful run of results, culminating in a 4\u20130 home defeat by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] led him to be sacked before the season came to an end with relegation desperately near. Jean Tigana made the club's record signing, buying [[Steve Marlet]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] for \u00a311.5&nbsp;million. He failed to live up to expectations, however, playing only 54 league games in three years and scoring only 11 goals. He was loaned out to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for 18 months when Coleman took over, with his sizeable contract still being paid by the English team, before it eventually expired.\n\nChris Coleman took charge for five games at the end of that (2002\u201303) season, earning Fulham 10 points out of a possible 15 and preserving a place in the Premier League for the next season.\nColeman was given the manager's job on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003 and despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation,<ref>Two of three writers of [[The Independent]] newspaper [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html predict]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} relegation for Fulham in the 2003/04 season.</ref> he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League|in his debut season]]. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], for which they received a club record \u00a313&nbsp;million. The final day of the season saw them win 2\u20130 away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], a third goal could have seen them jump the Trotters into eighth place. \n[[File:Van Der Sar Fulham.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Edwin van der Sar|Van der Sar]] and [[Steed Malbranque|Malbranque]] at Fulham]]\nColeman notched up another impressive performance in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|the 2004\u201305 season]] and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306 season]] proved a tougher affair, but safety was once again mathematically assured with three games left of the season and a 1\u20130 win over Wigan. There were three relative high points in an inconsistent season: a 6\u20131 rout of West Bromwich Albion, a 1\u20130 win over rivals and champions Chelsea in the [[West London derby]] and a 2\u20130 win over 2005 European champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Fulham's home form was the best outside the top six, with 12 wins from 18 games, while their away form was the worst in the entire league with one win and four draws from 18 games. A game they were winning away 1\u20130, against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], was abandoned after 21 minutes because of persistent snowfall.  Finally, on 29 April 2006, Fulham achieved a first away victory of the campaign with a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Despite the difficulties experienced throughout this season, Fulham achieved a 12th-place finish, an improvement on the previous campaign.\n\n[[File:Fulham on the attack.jpg|thumb|Fulham playing in light blue against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] 2005.]]\nFulham did not get off to a good start in 2006\u201307, losing their first match 5\u20131 to Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]]. This result consigned them to the foot of the table and left them as the season's favourites for early relegation contenders with the bookies, but then recovered well and were riding as high as eighth at one point in December 2006.\n\nDuring the January transfer window, Coleman added Russian midfielder [[Alexey Smertin]], American winger [[Clint Dempsey]] and fellow countryman [[Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979)|Simon Davies]] to the squad, and captured exciting loan signing [[Vincenzo Montella]]. Between mid-December and May, however, Fulham only won a single game, a 2\u20131 victory over Newcastle United. In the same time period, Fulham drew nine games and lost four. Additionally, Fulham were dumped meekly out of the FA Cup 4\u20130 by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. On 10 April 2007, following defeats at the hands of Manchester City (3\u20131) and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (4\u20131), Fulham terminated the contracts of Chris Coleman and Steve Kean with immediate effect, while [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]] and [[Les Reed (football coach)|Les Reed]] were put in charge on an interim basis.\n\nSanchez did not have the immediate impact that the Fulham board would have hoped for. With five games to save the season, Sanchez managed only a point from the first three, a home-draw against Blackburn Rovers sandwiched between away defeats to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and Arsenal. In Sanchez's fourth game, Fulham took on a Liverpool side largely focused on their upcoming Champions League final against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Liverpool manager [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] made nine changes to his starting XI for the game, much to the annoyance of [[Neil Warnock]], manager of fellow strugglers [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Fulham, however, still faced a strong team, eager to impress and stake their claims for a starting berth in the final. January signing Clint Dempsey took the game by the scruff of the neck in the 68th minute, combining neatly with English right-back [[Liam Rosenior]] to earn Sanchez his first victory and ensure safety for the West Londoners. Fulham finished the season with a 3\u20131 defeat away to Middlesbrough.\n\nDespite a return of just 4 points from a possible 15, Sanchez had retained Fulham's top-flight status and was rewarded for his efforts with a permanent contract, subsequently resigning as Northern Ireland manager on Friday 11 May 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6646959.stm Lawrie Sanchez leaves Northern Ireland for Fulham]  BBC Sport Website</ref>\n\nSanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer-break. The most expensive of these additions was striker [[Diomansy Kamara]], a \u00a36&nbsp;million signing from Championship outfit West Brom. The majority of Sanchez's purchases, however, were players from the Northern Ireland set-up, including [[Steven Davis]], [[David Healy (footballer)|David Healy]], [[Aaron Hughes]] and [[Chris Baird]].\n\nFulham showed little signs of improvement from the previous season but were unfortunate not to start the 2007\u201308 season with a victory, after leading Premier League title contenders Arsenal for 84 minutes at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Healy opened his Fulham account taking advantage of a mistake by Gunners' goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the opening minute. [[Robin van Persie]], however, replied from the penalty spot before [[Belarus]]ian [[Alexander Hleb]] added the winner in the 90th minute. Fulham brushed aside this disappointment to beat Bolton Wanderers 2\u20131 in the following match. Despite defensive frailties, The whites had begun their first-full season under Sanchez by playing attractive, attacking football. This Fulham team was cursed by bad luck, however, and as Sanchez was quick to point out, dubious refereeing decisions. In their third fixture of the season, at home to [[Gareth Southgate]]'s Middlesbrough, striker and club captain Brian McBride was seriously injured in the process of opening the scoring, before [[Tony Warner]]'s mistake allowed 'Boro back into the game. Fulham's misery and Sanchez's fury was compounded when Healy's injury time strike was incorrectly ruled out by the linesman, despite clearly crossing the goal-line.\n\nFollowing this result, Fulham registered several draws, including two six-goal thrillers against Tottenham and Manchester City. Both games showcased the good and bad aspects of Fulham's play under Sanchez \u2013 incisive attacking football undone by continued poor defending. Sanchez attempted a more direct style of play to grab an elusive win but his squad were ill-suited to long ball football. Though the former [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender oversaw a second win of the campaign at home to Reading, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007,after a defeat by Newcastle United, with Fulham in the relegation zone. His case was not helped by the number of Championship-quality players he signed and his reliance on a high-defensive live, despite employing relatively slow personnel.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gulluzzo |first=Mauro |title=Sanchez leaves Fulham |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/29160/Sanchez-leaves-Fulham |publisher=Daily Express |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== 2007\u20132010: Roy Hodgson years ==\n{{main|2007\u201308 Fulham F.C. season}}\n[[Roy Hodgson]] was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007, and took up his contractual duties on 30 December 2007,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham appoint Hodgson as manager | date=28 December 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> just two days before the January transfer window opened. The squad's spine was strengthened with the signings of [[Brede Hangeland]], [[Leon Andreasen]], [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer player)|Eddie Johnson]], [[Erik Nevland]] and veteran former Liverpool striker, [[Jari Litmanen]]. Canadian captain and right-back [[Paul Stalteri]] and Finland's [[Toni Kallio]] were also signed [[Loan (football)|on loan]] from Tottenham and [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], respectively. This new look squad was complemented by the return of key players and fan favourites Brian McBride and [[Jimmy Bullard]]. Both would prove to be hugely influential in Fulham's end-of-season run-in.\n\nHodgson's tenure started with a 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea on New Year's Day, followed by a goalless draw with Bolton Wanderers at the [[Reebok Stadium]] before he claimed his first win five days later against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], courtesy of a trademark Jimmy Bullard free-kick. Despite this positive start, Fulham struggled to build momentum and their form remained patchy throughout March. Hodgson did, however, add a second victory on 16 March 2008, against an Everton side chasing the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. Former Toffees Simon Davies and Brian McBride combined, with the latter heading home to secure a 1\u20130 win at Craven Cottage.\n\nAgain, however, Fulham failed to maintain a consistent run of form following a victory. A drab 3\u20131 home defeat at the hands of [[Roy Keane]]'s Sunderland side left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances. Fans contended that although Hodgson's side were markedly improved defensively, and retained possession much better than under either Coleman or Sanchez, with aesthetically pleasing football, a lack of firepower up front and the failure to settle on a first-choice XI had hurt the team and caused vital points to be dropped.\n\nDespite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable and rallied his team to win four of their remaining five games and secure their Premier League position for the [[2008\u201309 Premier League|2008\u201309 season]]. This incredible run of form started with a first away win in 34 attempts against relegation rivals Reading. For many fans, however, the turning point of the season came two games later, against Manchester City. Fulham trailed 2\u20130 at half-time and had the half-time scores from every game remained the same after 90 minutes, Fulham would have been relegated. The introduction of the much-maligned Diomansy Kamara, however, heralded the start of a fantastic comeback. Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered 3\u20132 victory and second consecutive away win.\n\nThis result set the scene for a \"six-pointer\" against fellow strugglers [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at Craven Cottage. McBride and Erik Nevland struck to lift Fulham out of the relegation zone for the first time in months and leave survival in the club's own hands.\n\nBarring a seven-goal margin win by Reading, a Fulham victory against a [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] side looking ahead to their first FA Cup Final appearance in 69 years would guarantee survival. This, however, would be no easy feat. Portsmouth manager [[Harry Redknapp]], himself a survivor of several relegation scrapes (West Ham in 1995 and 1997 as well as Portsmouth in 2006), promised to field a full-strength side. More importantly, Fulham had never recorded three consecutive victories in the Premier League, much less three consecutive away wins. Fulham's fans travelled to Fratton Park expecting a tense final-day and they were not disappointed. In fact, with 15 minutes to play, Fulham would again have been relegated had the scores remnained the same, with Birmingham and Reading leading comfortably. Kamara, however, earned Fulham a free-kick with 76 minutes played, and Bullard's delivery found [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore.\n\nAfter Fulham's relegation escape, Roy Hodgson spoke of the need to ensure Fulham never found themselves in such a precarious position again. He struck early during the summer transfer window to claim the signing of experienced Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] on a free transfer from Middlesbrough on 22 May 2008. On 28 May 2008, the club announced that captain and club legend Brian McBride would not renew his contract and would be returning to [[Major League Soccer]] to play for the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. On 12 June, Fulham added the signing of [[Andranik Teymourian]] to its summer acquisitions. The 25-year-old [[Armenia]]n-[[Iran]]ian defensive midfielder has played most recently for Bolton and the [[Iran national football team|Iran national team]]. [[Zolt\u00e1n Gera]] was also added to the squad earlier in the same month, after turning down a new contract with newly promoted West Brom. In early July, Toni Kallio, whom Hodgson had signed [[Loan (football)|on loan]] in January, signed a full contract with the club. On 15 July, Fulham announced the joint signing of [[Bobby Zamora]] and [[John Paintsil]] from [[London]] rivals West Ham.\n\nNext followed the saga of [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]], in which it was reported in the press on 29 June that Johnson (from Premier League rivals Everton) would be joining immediately for up to \u00a312&nbsp;million. The transfer eventually happened more than a week later and at fees rising to almost \u00a313&nbsp;million, then becoming the second most expensive signing in Fulham's history, after Steve Marlet.\n\n[[File:Fulham v Middlesbrough.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Clint Dempsey]] (23), [[John Paintsil]] (4), and [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] celebrate a goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].]]\nFulham's start to the season was not fantastic, falling 2\u20131 defeat away to Hull City. Two home games in quick succession, however, saw them record a surprise 1\u20130 victory over Arsenal as well as a 2\u20131 win against Bolton. They also beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], but it was a nervy affair for Fulham, who won 3\u20132 after being 2\u20131 down with seven minutes to play, Danny Murphy scoring the winner in stoppage time. Four successive defeats, three of which were in the League to Blackburn, West Ham] and West Brom, saw Fulham slide down the table; the other defeat, away to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], saw them go out of the League Cup.\n\nTwo draws against Sunderland and Portsmouth helped to stop the rot, and a 2\u20130 home win against Wigan was crucial. Fulham then somehow contrived to lose away to Everton, but they rectified this by defeating both Newcastle and Tottenham at Craven Cottage. The win against Spurs was particularly noteworthy, as Roy Hodgson's side became the first to beat Tottenham under their new manager Harry Redknapp. Two 0\u20130 draws away to Liverpool and Aston Villa saw them rise to tenth in the table, already picking up over half their points tally of last season. Their 1\u20131 draw at home with Manchester City, followed by their 0\u20130 draw away at Stoke City mean that they are now unbeaten in six matches. Following the Stoke match, Fulham had a very comfortable 3\u20130 win against Boro.\n\nDespite not winning either of their next two fixtures, the Christmas period was a satisfactory one for Fulham: on Boxing Day, they drew 0\u20130 away to Tottenham (the year before they had lost 5\u20131 in the same fixture on the same day), and two days later they snatched a dramatic draw at home to their local rivals Chelsea, with both goals coming from American Clint Dempsey. This saw them cement their place in mid-table, where they still remain at ninth position in the third week of March 2009, a month in which they have had mixed results, losing 1\u20132 to lowly ranked Blackburn and 0\u20131 to Hull City, but sensationally prevailing 2\u20130 on 21 March 2009 at Craven Cottage against Premier League defending champions and 2008\u201309 leaders Manchester United, who had two players, [[Paul Scholes]] and [[Wayne Rooney]], sent off. The goals for Fulham were scored by Danny Murphy and Zolt\u00e1n Gera. Earlier in the season, the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, eventually losing at home to Manchester United. \n\nThe following season saw Fulham achieve arguably its greatest success reaching the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|2009-10 Europa League Final]] losing to [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 after extra time. The club also finished 12th in the Premier League that season. This resulted in Roy Hodgson being voted the [[LMA Manager of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&sec=england&cc=5739 |title=Fulham's Roy Hodgson voted Manager of the Year by fellow bosses \u2013 ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231143218/http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&sec=england&cc=5739 |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== 2010\u2013present: Ups and downs ==\n\nOn 29 July 2010, [[Mark Hughes]] succeeded Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. But Hughes resigned after only one season on 2 June 2011. [[Martin Jol]] replaced Hughes as manager on a two-year deal. [[Shahid Khan]] took over as chairman in July 2013. Since then the club has had a succession of managers with Martin Jol being quickly replaced by [[Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen]] and other managers including [[Felix Magath]], and temporary roles for [[Kit Symons]] and [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]]. This upheaval resulted in a spell back in the Championship. It was not until Khan appointed [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] that Fulham started to improve and he took them back to the Premier League in 2017\u201318. However, Jokanovi\u0107 was sacked in November 2018 after a poor start to the season and replaced with former Leicester manager [[Claudio Ranieri]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2018/november/14/claudio-ranieri-named-manager-of-fulham-football-club|title=Ranieri Named Manager|publisher=Fulham F.C.|date=14 November 2018|accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> But the Italian was unable to turn things around and was replaced in February 2019 by coach [[Scott Parker]] as caretaker manager.

The club's first ever league game, playing in the [[Football League Second Division|2nd Division]]'s [[1907\u201308 in English football#Second Division|1907-8 season]], saw them losing 1\u20130 at home to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 3 September 1907. The first win came a few days later on 7 September 1907 at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s [[Baseball Ground]], by a score of 1\u20130. When they eventually found their feet in the division they impressed, ending up only three points short of promotion in fourth place. However, this was the best season they had in their 21-year stay in that division, and after only winning 13 out of 42 games in the [[1927\u201328 in English football|1927\u201328 season]] Fulham were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|3rd Division South]], which was created in 1920.\n\nA highlight of that first season was an 8\u20133 away win at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in an [[FA Cup]] game. The club actually managed to reach the semi-finals of that tournament, where they were humbled 6\u20130 by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game.<ref>See the FA Cup-specific page in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501164543/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/FACupHistory/RemarkableFailure.aspx club history] on the official website</ref> A couple of years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the [[1909\u201310 in English football|1909\u201310 season]].\n\nDuring this period, businessman and politician [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. When he rejected an offer from businessman [[Gus Mears]] to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal.\n\nAfter finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the 3rd Division South, Fulham won the division in the [[1931\u201332 in English football|1931\u201332 season]]. In doing so, they beat [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] 10\u20132, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The [[1932\u201333 in English football|next season]], they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the [[1935\u201336 in English football|1935\u201336 season]]. On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.\n\nLeague and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national [[Football League War Cup]] and a [[London War Cup]] up for grabs. Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for [[1946\u201347 in English football|1946\u201347]]. In [[1948\u201349 in English football|the third season]] of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win-loss-draw record of 24\u20139\u20139 (identical to that which won them the 3rd Division South 17 years previously).\n\n== 1949\u20131970: Reaching the top flight ==\nPromotion to the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the [[1951\u201352 in English football|1951\u201352 season]], winning only 8 of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Delorimier Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] in front of 29,000 spectators.<ref>[http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm Celtic Programmes Online - Tours of the USA and Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1949\u201352\n| Football League ''[[Football League First Division|Div.

Also joining Fulham in 1958 was [[Graham Leggat]], who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer. In the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360 season]], they achieved tenth position in the 1st Division, which until finishing ninth in the [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League]] was their highest ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.\n\nBy this time the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at [[Craven Cottage]],<ref>According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx club history] at the official website</ref> despite struggling in the League. The club experienced several close escapes from relegation none more spectacular than in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]]. On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham had just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually the club suffered relegation in the [[1967\u201368 in English football|1967\u201368 season]], having won just 10 out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only 7 in 42, the club were again relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|3rd Division]]. (Note that this is not the same as the 3rd Division South, as the regional 3rd Divisions had been removed with the 1959 creation of the [[Football League Fourth Division|4th Division]]).\n\nIt is impossible to talk about Fulham's history without mentioning probably the single most influential character in Fulham's history, [[Johnny Haynes]].<ref>This is of course somewhat subjective, but he is the first player mentioned in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx Great names] section of the club's history on the official website.

This spell also saw Fulham invited to the not particularly prestigious [[Anglo-Italian Cup]], which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1973. Thus started off a period of high-profile signings for the club under [[Alec Stock]] in the mid-1970s, including [[Alan Mullery]] and [[Bobby Moore]]. The reward of this was their only ever FA Cup final in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club then lost to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the final. This gained the club qualification to another low-key European tournament, the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]], where they made the final, losing to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].\n\nThat run in the FA Cup saw the setting of an improbable record, that of the most games needed to reach the final, Fulham playing 11 games including replays. In the buildup to the 12th game, the Wembley final, Tony Rees and the Cottagers released a single, ''\"Viva el Fulham\"'' (based on [[Manolo Escobar]]'s ''\"Y viva Espa\u00f1a\"'') which is still played (and occasionally chanted) at Fulham games.

[[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play 1st Division football and play for [[England national football team|England]], rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.\n\nThe hangover from this meant the club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 in the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380 season]], followed by [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]]'s sacking in October 1980, replaced by [[Malcolm Macdonald]]. With a strong squad during his 1980\u20131984 period in charge (with players such as [[Ray Houghton]], [[Tony Gale]], [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]], [[Gerry Peyton]] and [[Ray Lewington]]), they won promotion again in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]] back to Division 2. In 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now [[London Broncos#2006\u20132011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]], designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club. Then called Fulham Rugby League, they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.\n\nFulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], losing 1\u20130 to Derby County away on the last day of the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] \u2013 although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a pitch invasion. The side which had shown so much promise was gradually sold off and broken up as the club had debts to pay off, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 with the breakdown of an ill-advised merger attempt with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. The intervention of the Football League and the emergence of a concortum fronted by ex-player [[Jimmy Hill]] allowed the club to stay in business as a re-structured Fulham FC (1987) Ltd. In the same year, the club took part in the longest penalty decider recorded to that time \u2013 it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] in a [[Football League Trophy|Freight Rover Trophy]] match.\n\nIn 1992, the foundation of the [[Premier League]], and the resignation of the entire top division from the Football League, saw Fulham elevated to the 2nd Division. The club, however, was relegated from that to the new 3rd Division after a poor [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]], following which [[Ian Branfoot]] was appointed manager.\n\n== 1994\u201397: Fulham start rise from fourth tier ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1994\u201397\n| Football League ''Div.

Branfoot was soon sacked as team manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while.\n\nIn February 1996, the club appointed then-player [[Micky Adams]] as manager, and it was in the summer of that year that his revolution really took off. That signalled the start of the new era of Fulham. Adams was appointed as manager and oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of what little relegation danger was present (as it turned out, no team was even relegated from the league that season). The next campaign, he engineered a complete turnaround in form and his side, captained by [[Simon Morgan]], finished second \u2013 only missing out on first place because the League had dropped the old \"goal difference\" to decide tied positions, system in favour of a \"goals scored\" tally. (While Fulham's goal difference was one better than that of champions [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], they scored 12 fewer goals.) This was somewhat ironic, as the club's then chairman Jimmy Hill had successfully argued that goals scored should decide positions of teams tied on points at the Football League's 1992 AGM.\n\n== 1997\u20132001: Al Fayed's revolution ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|-\n! 1997\u201399\n| Football League ''Div.

Frenchman [[Jean Tigana]] was put in charge and with only two changes to the first team, including [[France|French]] striker [[Louis Saha]], he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in [[2000\u201301 in English football#Football League First Division|the 2000\u201301 season]] in emphatic style, scoring 90 goals in 46 games. That gave Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968, which had only taken four years \u2013 one shorter than Al Fayed's pledge. During this season, club captain and subsequent manager [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] was involved in a car crash which put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw many players come and go, and the only player to play for the club in all four leagues was [[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]], indeed he is one of few players to ever have played in four divisions of professional football with one team.\n\n== 2001\u201307: Premiership years ==\nDespite some scepticism,<ref>Such as those [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/sports_talk/1492984.stm at the BBC].</ref> Fulham were widely tipped to take the Premier League by storm, with many pundits<ref>Such as those in [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-77218866 The Mirror].</ref> predicting a challenge for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] or even [[UEFA Champions League]] places, but their [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|first Premier League season]] was largely underwhelming; despite a couple of good games and some flashes of brilliance, the end product was a respectable 13th-place finish. Fulham remain the only team in this millennium to host top-flight football with some standing areas. Due to [[Taylor report|restrictions on standings]], Fulham decamped to [[Loftus Road]] during the 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 seasons while their own stadium was rebuilt, but then returned to Craven Cottage.\n\n[[File:Fulham v Pompey (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (White) playing [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] (Blue) in front of Fulham fans in the Hammersmith End.]] \nThe [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|following season]] saw Fulham dangerously close to the relegation zone, and chairman Mohammed Al Fayed told Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. But an awful run of results, culminating in a 4\u20130 home defeat by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] led him to be sacked before the season came to an end with relegation desperately near. Jean Tigana made the club's record signing, buying [[Steve Marlet]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] for \u00a311.5&nbsp;million. He failed to live up to expectations, however, playing only 54 league games in three years and scoring only 11 goals. He was loaned out to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for 18 months when Coleman took over, with his sizeable contract still being paid by the English team, before it eventually expired.\n\nChris Coleman took charge for five games at the end of that (2002\u201303) season, earning Fulham 10 points out of a possible 15 and preserving a place in the Premier League for the next season.\nColeman was given the manager's job on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003 and despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation,<ref>Two of three writers of [[The Independent]] newspaper [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html predict]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} relegation for Fulham in the 2003/04 season.</ref> he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League|in his debut season]]. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], for which they received a club record \u00a313&nbsp;million. The final day of the season saw them win 2\u20130 away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], a third goal could have seen them jump the Trotters into eighth place. \n[[File:Van Der Sar Fulham.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Edwin van der Sar|Van der Sar]] and [[Steed Malbranque|Malbranque]] at Fulham]]\nColeman notched up another impressive performance in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|the 2004\u201305 season]] and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306 season]] proved a tougher affair, but safety was once again mathematically assured with three games left of the season and a 1\u20130 win over Wigan. There were three relative high points in an inconsistent season: a 6\u20131 rout of West Bromwich Albion, a 1\u20130 win over rivals and champions Chelsea in the [[West London derby]] and a 2\u20130 win over 2005 European champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Fulham's home form was the best outside the top six, with 12 wins from 18 games, while their away form was the worst in the entire league with one win and four draws from 18 games. A game they were winning away 1\u20130, against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], was abandoned after 21 minutes because of persistent snowfall.  Finally, on 29 April 2006, Fulham achieved a first away victory of the campaign with a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Despite the difficulties experienced throughout this season, Fulham achieved a 12th-place finish, an improvement on the previous campaign.\n\n[[File:Fulham on the attack.jpg|thumb|Fulham playing in light blue against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] 2005.]]\nFulham did not get off to a good start in 2006\u201307, losing their first match 5\u20131 to Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]]. This result consigned them to the foot of the table and left them as the season's favourites for early relegation contenders with the bookies, but then recovered well and were riding as high as eighth at one point in December 2006.\n\nDuring the January transfer window, Coleman added Russian midfielder [[Alexey Smertin]], American winger [[Clint Dempsey]] and fellow countryman [[Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979)|Simon Davies]] to the squad, and captured exciting loan signing [[Vincenzo Montella]]. Between mid-December and May, however, Fulham only won a single game, a 2\u20131 victory over Newcastle United. In the same time period, Fulham drew nine games and lost four. Additionally, Fulham were dumped meekly out of the FA Cup 4\u20130 by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. On 10 April 2007, following defeats at the hands of Manchester City (3\u20131) and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (4\u20131), Fulham terminated the contracts of Chris Coleman and Steve Kean with immediate effect, while [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]] and [[Les Reed (football coach)|Les Reed]] were put in charge on an interim basis.\n\nSanchez did not have the immediate impact that the Fulham board would have hoped for. With five games to save the season, Sanchez managed only a point from the first three, a home-draw against Blackburn Rovers sandwiched between away defeats to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and Arsenal. In Sanchez's fourth game, Fulham took on a Liverpool side largely focused on their upcoming Champions League final against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Liverpool manager [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] made nine changes to his starting XI for the game, much to the annoyance of [[Neil Warnock]], manager of fellow strugglers [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Fulham, however, still faced a strong team, eager to impress and stake their claims for a starting berth in the final. January signing Clint Dempsey took the game by the scruff of the neck in the 68th minute, combining neatly with English right-back [[Liam Rosenior]] to earn Sanchez his first victory and ensure safety for the West Londoners. Fulham finished the season with a 3\u20131 defeat away to Middlesbrough.\n\nDespite a return of just 4 points from a possible 15, Sanchez had retained Fulham's top-flight status and was rewarded for his efforts with a permanent contract, subsequently resigning as Northern Ireland manager on Friday 11 May 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6646959.stm Lawrie Sanchez leaves Northern Ireland for Fulham]  BBC Sport Website</ref>\n\nSanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer-break. The most expensive of these additions was striker [[Diomansy Kamara]], a \u00a36&nbsp;million signing from Championship outfit West Brom. The majority of Sanchez's purchases, however, were players from the Northern Ireland set-up, including [[Steven Davis]], [[David Healy (footballer)|David Healy]], [[Aaron Hughes]] and [[Chris Baird]].\n\nFulham showed little signs of improvement from the previous season but were unfortunate not to start the 2007\u201308 season with a victory, after leading Premier League title contenders Arsenal for 84 minutes at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Healy opened his Fulham account taking advantage of a mistake by Gunners' goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the opening minute. [[Robin van Persie]], however, replied from the penalty spot before [[Belarus]]ian [[Alexander Hleb]] added the winner in the 90th minute. Fulham brushed aside this disappointment to beat Bolton Wanderers 2\u20131 in the following match. Despite defensive frailties, The whites had begun their first-full season under Sanchez by playing attractive, attacking football. This Fulham team was cursed by bad luck, however, and as Sanchez was quick to point out, dubious refereeing decisions. In their third fixture of the season, at home to [[Gareth Southgate]]'s Middlesbrough, striker and club captain Brian McBride was seriously injured in the process of opening the scoring, before [[Tony Warner]]'s mistake allowed 'Boro back into the game. Fulham's misery and Sanchez's fury was compounded when Healy's injury time strike was incorrectly ruled out by the linesman, despite clearly crossing the goal-line.\n\nFollowing this result, Fulham registered several draws, including two six-goal thrillers against Tottenham and Manchester City. Both games showcased the good and bad aspects of Fulham's play under Sanchez \u2013 incisive attacking football undone by continued poor defending. Sanchez attempted a more direct style of play to grab an elusive win but his squad were ill-suited to long ball football. Though the former [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender oversaw a second win of the campaign at home to Reading, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007,after a defeat by Newcastle United, with Fulham in the relegation zone. His case was not helped by the number of Championship-quality players he signed and his reliance on a high-defensive live, despite employing relatively slow personnel.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gulluzzo |first=Mauro |title=Sanchez leaves Fulham |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/29160/Sanchez-leaves-Fulham |publisher=Daily Express |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== 2007\u20132010: Roy Hodgson years ==\n{{main|2007\u201308 Fulham F.C. season}}\n[[Roy Hodgson]] was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007, and took up his contractual duties on 30 December 2007,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham appoint Hodgson as manager | date=28 December 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> just two days before the January transfer window opened. The squad's spine was strengthened with the signings of [[Brede Hangeland]], [[Leon Andreasen]], [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer player)|Eddie Johnson]], [[Erik Nevland]] and veteran former Liverpool striker, [[Jari Litmanen]]. Canadian captain and right-back [[Paul Stalteri]] and Finland's [[Toni Kallio]] were also signed [[Loan (football)|on loan]] from Tottenham and [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]], respectively. This new look squad was complemented by the return of key players and fan favourites Brian McBride and [[Jimmy Bullard]]. Both would prove to be hugely influential in Fulham's end-of-season run-in.\n\nHodgson's tenure started with a 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea on New Year's Day, followed by a goalless draw with Bolton Wanderers at the [[Reebok Stadium]] before he claimed his first win five days later against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], courtesy of a trademark Jimmy Bullard free-kick. Despite this positive start, Fulham struggled to build momentum and their form remained patchy throughout March. Hodgson did, however, add a second victory on 16 March 2008, against an Everton side chasing the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. Former Toffees Simon Davies and Brian McBride combined, with the latter heading home to secure a 1\u20130 win at Craven Cottage.\n\nAgain, however, Fulham failed to maintain a consistent run of form following a victory. A drab 3\u20131 home defeat at the hands of [[Roy Keane]]'s Sunderland side left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances. Fans contended that although Hodgson's side were markedly improved defensively, and retained possession much better than under either Coleman or Sanchez, with aesthetically pleasing football, a lack of firepower up front and the failure to settle on a first-choice XI had hurt the team and caused vital points to be dropped.\n\nDespite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable and rallied his team to win four of their remaining five games and secure their Premier League position for the [[2008\u201309 Premier League|2008\u201309 season]]. This incredible run of form started with a first away win in 34 attempts against relegation rivals Reading. For many fans, however, the turning point of the season came two games later, against Manchester City. Fulham trailed 2\u20130 at half-time and had the half-time scores from every game remained the same after 90 minutes, Fulham would have been relegated. The introduction of the much-maligned Diomansy Kamara, however, heralded the start of a fantastic comeback. Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered 3\u20132 victory and second consecutive away win.\n\nThis result set the scene for a \"six-pointer\" against fellow strugglers [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at Craven Cottage. McBride and Erik Nevland struck to lift Fulham out of the relegation zone for the first time in months and leave survival in the club's own hands.\n\nBarring a seven goal margin win by Reading, a Fulham victory against a [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] side looking ahead to their first FA Cup Final appearance in 69 years would guarantee survival. This, however, would be no easy feat. Portsmouth manager [[Harry Redknapp]], himself a survivor of several relegation scrapes (West Ham in 1995 and 1997 as well as Portsmouth in 2006), promised to field a full-strength side. More importantly, Fulham had never recorded three consecutive victories in the Premier League, much less three consecutive away wins. Fulham's fans travelled to Fratton Park expecting a tense final-day and they were not disappointed. In fact, with 15 minutes to play, Fulham would again have been relegated had the scores remnained the same, with Birmingham and Reading leading comfortably. Kamara, however, earned Fulham a free-kick with 76 minutes played, and Bullard's delivery found [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore.\n\nAfter Fulham's relegation escape, Roy Hodgson spoke of the need to ensure Fulham never found themselves in such a precarious position again. He struck early during the summer transfer window to claim the signing of experienced Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] on a free transfer from Middlesbrough on 22 May 2008. On 28 May 2008, the club announced that captain and club legend Brian McBride would not renew his contract and would be returning to [[Major League Soccer]] to play for the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. On 12 June, Fulham added the signing of [[Andranik Teymourian]] to its summer acquisitions. The 25-year-old [[Armenia]]n-[[Iran]]ian defensive midfielder has played most recently for Bolton and the [[Iran national football team|Iran national team]]. [[Zolt\u00e1n Gera]] was also added to the squad earlier in the same month, after turning down a new contract with newly promoted West Brom. In early July, Toni Kallio, whom Hodgson had signed [[Loan (football)|on loan]] in January, signed a full contract with the club. On 15 July, Fulham announced the joint signing of [[Bobby Zamora]] and [[John Paintsil]] from [[London]] rivals West Ham.\n\nNext followed the saga of [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]], in which it was reported in the press on 29 June that Johnson (from Premier League rivals Everton) would be joining immediately for up to \u00a312&nbsp;million. The transfer eventually happened more than a week later and at fees rising to almost \u00a313&nbsp;million, then becoming the second most expensive signing in Fulham's history, after Steve Marlet.\n\n[[File:Fulham v Middlesbrough.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Clint Dempsey]] (23), [[John Paintsil]] (4), and [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] celebrate a goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].]]\nFulham's start to the season was not fantastic, falling 2\u20131 defeat away to Hull City. Two home games in quick succession, however, saw them record a surprise 1\u20130 victory over Arsenal as well as a 2\u20131 win against Bolton. They also beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], but it was a nervy affair for Fulham, who won 3\u20132 after being 2\u20131 down with seven minutes to play, Danny Murphy scoring the winner in stoppage time. Four successive defeats, three of which were in the League to Blackburn, West Ham] and West Brom, saw Fulham slide down the table; the other defeat, away to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], saw them go out of the League Cup.\n\nTwo draws against Sunderland and Portsmouth helped to stop the rot, and a 2\u20130 home win against Wigan was crucial. Fulham then somehow contrived to lose away to Everton, but they rectified this by defeating both Newcastle and Tottenham at Craven Cottage. The win against Spurs was particularly noteworthy, as Roy Hodgson's side became the first to beat Tottenham under their new manager Harry Redknapp. Two 0\u20130 draws away to Liverpool and Aston Villa saw them rise to tenth in the table, already picking up over half their points tally of last season. Their 1\u20131 draw at home with Manchester City, followed by their 0\u20130 draw away at Stoke City mean that they are now unbeaten in six matches. Following the Stoke match, Fulham had a very comfortable 3\u20130 win against Boro.\n\nDespite not winning either of their next two fixtures, the Christmas period was a satisfactory one for Fulham: on Boxing Day, they drew 0\u20130 away to Tottenham (the year before they had lost 5\u20131 in the same fixture on the same day), and two days later they snatched a dramatic draw at home to their local rivals Chelsea, with both goals coming from American Clint Dempsey. This saw them cement their place in mid-table, where they still remain at ninth position in the third week of March 2009, a month in which they have had mixed results, losing 1\u20132 to lowly ranked Blackburn and 0\u20131 to Hull City, but sensationally prevailing 2\u20130 on 21 March 2009 at Craven Cottage against Premier League defending champions and 2008\u201309 leaders Manchester United, who had two players, [[Paul Scholes]] and [[Wayne Rooney]], sent off. The goals for Fulham were scored by Danny Murphy and Zolt\u00e1n Gera. Earlier in the season, the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, eventually losing at home to Manchester United. \n\nThe following season saw Fulham achieve arguably its greatest success reaching the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|2009-10 Europa League Final]] losing to [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 after extra time. The club also finished 12th in the Premier League that season. This resulted in Roy Hodgson being voted the [[LMA Manager of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&sec=england&cc=5739 |title=Fulham's Roy Hodgson voted Manager of the Year by fellow bosses \u2013 ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231143218/http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&sec=england&cc=5739 |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== 2010\u2013present: Ups and downs ==\n\nOn 29 July 2010, [[Mark Hughes]] succeeded Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. But Hughes resigned after only one season on 2 June 2011. [[Martin Jol]] replaced Hughes as manager on a two-year deal. [[Shahid Khan]] took over as chairman in July 2013. Since then the club has had a succession of managers with Martin Jol being quickly replaced by [[Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen]] and other managers including [[Felix Magath]], and temporary roles for [[Kit Symons]] and [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]]. This upheaval resulted in a spell back in the Championship. It was not until Khan appointed [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] that Fulham started to improve and he took them back to the Premier League in 2017-18. However, Jokanovi\u0107 was sacked in November 2018 after a poor start to the season and replaced with former Leicester manager [[Claudio Ranieri]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2018/november/14/claudio-ranieri-named-manager-of-fulham-football-club|title=Ranieri Named Manager|publisher=Fulham F.C.|date=14 November 2018|accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> But the Italian was unable to turn things around and was replaced in February 2019 by coach [[Scott Parker]] as caretaker manager.
