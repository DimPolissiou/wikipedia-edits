More elaborate versions are widely played in Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Paraguay and Brazil under such names as [[Truco]], Truque and Truquiflor.\n\n==History==\n\nThe game of Truc probably originates from the end of the Middle Ages in Spain, regarding the etymology of the word, which means \"trick\" (or to trick into false announcements), later migrating to France.\n\nThe ''Diccionario de Pompeu Fabra'' states that Truc is a game of cards usually played by four players, each receiving three cards and scoring points for winning two of the three tricks, and whose bluffing objective is to trick the opponent into conceding the number of points summed by the point value of two cards of the same suit under a vie, and in some variants of Truquiflor, by having Flor or a winning Flor (a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit) whose point value is higher than another.<ref>FABRA I POCH, Pompeu: ''Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana''. Barcelona, Antoni L\u00f3pez Llaus\u00e0s, 1968, 5\u00aa edici\u00f3n.<br />''Truc: \"joc de cartes que es juga ordin\u00e0riament entre quatre persones que van dues contra les altres dues, cadascuna de les quals rep tres cartes i cada bandol guanya punts guanyant dues bases (guanyar el truc), les cartes matantse le unes a les altres segons un ordre establert, y fent objecte d'envit el guanyar el truc (trucar) o el nombre de punts que sumen els valor de dues cartes del mateix [mismo] coll [palo] acoblades [emparejadas] en una m\u00e0 (envidar), i, en algunes variants del joc (truquiFlor), pel fet de tenir Flor o una Flor guanyadora d'una altra\".''</ref>\n\n[[Francesc de Borja i Moll]], in his ''Diccionari Catal\u00e0'', offers a similar definition, recalling the hierarchy of the cards as: 3 2 A K Q J 9 8 7 6, and a brief entry on the Matarrata variant, a similar game in which the 7 {{Diamonds}} ranks higher than 7 {{Spades}}, A {{Clubs}} and A {{Spades}}.<ref>''Diccionari Catal\u00e0''. FRANCESC DE B. MOLL, Valenci\u00e0, Balear. Palma de Mallorca, Moll, 1993, Tomo X, p\u00e1g. 540.<br />''Matarrata\u2026 '''truc d\u2019espaseta''': joc semblant al truc, del qual es diferencia perqu\u00e8 el set \u00e9s guanyat pel set d\u2019oros, aquest pel d\u2019espases, aquest per l\u2019as de bastos i aquest per l\u2019as d\u2019espases.''</ref>\n\nTruc is closely related to the old English game of [[Put (card game)|put]], which was first described by Cotton in ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674).<ref>''Dictionary of Card Games'', p. 319, David Parlett {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\n==Game==\n\nTwo players use a 32-card pack ranking 7 8 A K Q J 10 9 in each suit. A rubber is the best of three games, and a game is 12 points, which may require several deals to reach. Players deal in turn with the first dealer being chosen by any agreed means.\n\nPlayers receive 3 cards dealt in 1s. The aim in each deal is to win two tricks, to win the first trick if it comes to be that both players win one and the third is tied, by making the opponent fold to a raise. Non-dealer may also propose a redeal if dealer agrees. The hands are put aside and each receives 3 new cards. Only one redeal may be made, and only if both players agree.\n\n==Play==\n\nNon-dealer leads to the first trick and the winner of each trick leads to the next. As Truc is a no-trump game, any card may be played by either player and tricks are taken by the highest card led regardless of the suit played. If both play cards of equal ranks, the trick is then  considered \"spoilt\", belonging to none of the players, and the same leader leads to the next.\n\n==Score==\n\nTheoretically, the winner scores one point to every game. However, before playing to a trick, either player may offer to increase the score for a win by asking: \"Two more ?\". The first such increase raises the value from 1 point to 2, and subsequently increases add 2 more each, raising the game value from 2 to 4, than 6, and so on. If the other says: \"Yes\", play continues, if not he throws his hand in, play ceases and the challenger scores whatever it was worth before he offered to raise. It is possible for both players to raise in the same trick (the leader before leading to a trick and, if accepted, the follower before replying). It is also legal to concede at any time, even if the other has not just offered to double.\n\n'''Mon reste'''\n\nAn even more drastic raise may be made if either players on his turn to play may declare: \"My remainder (Mon reste), thus jump-raising the game value to whatever he needs to make 12. To this, however, the opponent may either concede, in which case the increase does not take effect, or may himself announce \"My remainder\", in which whomever wins the deal wins the game. The round finishes when one player concedes or when trick tricks have been completed. Whoever took three tricks, or the first if each took one, scores the point, or whatever value it may have been increased to. If all three tricks were spoilt, neither player scores.\n\n===<span style=\"color:black;\">Partnership Truc</span>===\n\nFour players sit crosswise in partnerships. The turn to deal and play is counter-clockwise. The dealer acts as governor for his partnership and [[eldest hand]] as governor for his. Only eldest may propose an exchange, and only dealer may accept or refuse it. Eldest leads to the first trick, and each subsequent trick is led by the winner of the last, or by the previous leader if the trick is spoilt. Similarly, only the governor may accept or concede when an increase is proposed.\n\nThroughout play, governor's partner may indicate what card or cards he holds by means of conventional code or gestural signals, and the governor for his part may tell his partner what to play. Players may not reverse these roles. The holding of a Seven is indicated by a grin, an Eight by a wink, an Ace by a shrug. Naturally, the signaller will attempt to signal when his governor is looking and his opponents are not. An instruction may take the form: \"Play the Seven\", \"Play low\", \"Leave it to me\", and so on. Signals must be truthfully made, and instructions obeyed.\n\nA trick is spoilt if the highest card played by one side is matched in rank by the highest card played by one of the other.

Jeu de cartes usit\u00e9 en Languedoc.''</ref> [[Sarthe]] (where it is known as ''trut''), [[Poitou]] (''tru'') and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (''truka''), and is still very popular in the [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]] region (''joc del truc''). More elaborate versions are widely played in [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]] under such names as [[Truco]], Truque and Truquiflor.\n\n==History==\n\nThe game of Truc probably originates from the end of the Middle Ages in Spain, regarding the etymology of the word, which means \"trick\" (or to trick into false announcements), later migrating to France.\n\nThe ''Diccionario de Pompeu Fabra'' states that Truc is a game of cards usually played by four players, each receiving three cards and scoring points for winning two of the three tricks, and whose bluffing objective is to trick the opponent into conceding the number of points summed by the point value of two cards of the same suit under a vie, and in some variants of Truquiflor, by having Flor or a winning Flor (a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit) whose point value is higher than another.<ref>FABRA I POCH, Pompeu: ''Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana''. Barcelona, Antoni L\u00f3pez Llaus\u00e0s, 1968, 5\u00aa edici\u00f3n.<br />''Truc: \"joc de cartes que es juga ordin\u00e0riament entre quatre persones que van dues contra les altres dues, cadascuna de les quals rep tres cartes i cada bandol guanya punts guanyant dues bases (guanyar el truc), les cartes matantse le unes a les altres segons un ordre establert, y fent objecte d'envit el guanyar el truc (trucar) o el nombre de punts que sumen els valor de dues cartes del mateix [mismo] coll [palo] acoblades [emparejadas] en una m\u00e0 (envidar), i, en algunes variants del joc (truquiFlor), pel fet de tenir Flor o una Flor guanyadora d'una altra\".''</ref>\n\n[[Francesc de Borja i Moll]], in his ''Diccionari Catal\u00e0'', offers a similar definition, recalling the hierarchy of the cards as: 3 2 A K Q J 9 8 7 6, and a brief entry on the Matarrata variant, a similar game in which the 7 {{Diamonds}} ranks higher than 7 {{Spades}}, A {{Clubs}} and A {{Spades}}.<ref>''Diccionari Catal\u00e0''. FRANCESC DE B. MOLL, Valenci\u00e0, Balear. Palma de Mallorca, Moll, 1993, Tomo X, p\u00e1g. 540.<br />''Matarrata\u2026 '''truc d\u2019espaseta''': joc semblant al truc, del qual es diferencia perqu\u00e8 el set \u00e9s guanyat pel set d\u2019oros, aquest pel d\u2019espases, aquest per l\u2019as de bastos i aquest per l\u2019as d\u2019espases.''</ref>\n\nTruc is closely related to the old [[England|English]] game of [[Put (Card Game)|put]], which was first described by Cotton in ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674).<ref>''Dictionary of Card Games'', p. 319, David Parlett {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\n==Game==\n\nTwo players use a 32-card pack ranking 7 8 A K Q J 10 9 in each suit. A rubber is the best of three games, and a game is 12 points, which may require several deals to reach. Players deal in turn with the first dealer being chosen by any agreed means.\n\nPlayers receive 3 cards dealt in 1s. The aim in each deal is to win two tricks, to win the first trick if it comes to be that both players win one and the third is tied, by making the opponent fold to a raise. Non-dealer may also propose a redeal if dealer agrees. The hands are put aside and each receives 3 new cards. Only one redeal may be made, and only if both players agree.\n\n==Play==\n\nNon-dealer leads to the first trick and the winner of each trick leads to the next. As Truc is a no-trump game, any card may be played by either player and tricks are taken by the highest card led regardless of the suit played. If both play cards of equal ranks, the trick is then  considered \"spoilt\", belonging to none of the players, and the same leader leads to the next.\n\n==Score==\n\nTheoretically, the winner scores one point to every game. However, before playing to a trick, either player may offer to increase the score for a win by asking: \"Two more ?\". The first such increase raises the value from 1 point to 2, and subsequently increases add 2 more each, raising the game value from 2 to 4, than 6, and so on. If the other says: \"Yes\", play continues, if not he throws his hand in, play ceases and the challenger scores whatever it was worth before he offered to raise. It is possible for both players to raise in the same trick (the leader before leading to a trick and, if accepted, the follower before replying). It is also legal to concede at any time, even if the other has not just offered to double.\n\n'''Mon reste'''\n\nAn even more drastic raise may be made if either players on his turn to play may declare: \"My remainder (Mon reste), thus jump-raising the game value to whatever he needs to make 12. To this, however, the opponent may either concede, in which case the increase does not take effect, or may himself announce \"My remainder\", in which whomever wins the deal wins the game. The round finishes when one player concedes or when trick tricks have been completed. Whoever took three tricks, or the first if each took one, scores the point, or whatever value it may have been increased to. If all three tricks were spoilt, neither player scores.\n\n===<span style=\"color:black;\">Partnership Truc</span>===\n\nFour players sit crosswise in partnerships. The turn to deal and play is counter-clockwise. The dealer acts as governor for his partnership and [[eldest hand]] as governor for his. Only eldest may propose an exchange, and only dealer may accept or refuse it. Eldest leads to the first trick, and each subsequent trick is led by the winner of the last, or by the previous leader if the trick is spoilt. Similarly, only the governor may accept or concede when an increase is proposed.\n\nThroughout play, governor's partner may indicate what card or cards he holds by means of conventional code or gestural signals, and the governor for his part may tell his partner what to play. Players may not reverse these roles. The holding of a Seven is indicated by a grin, an Eight by a wink, an Ace by a shrug. Naturally, the signaller will attempt to signal when his governor is looking and his opponents are not. An instruction may take the form: \"Play the Seven\", \"Play low\", \"Leave it to me\", and so on. Signals must be truthfully made, and instructions obeyed.\n\nA trick is spoilt if the highest card played by one side is matched in rank by the highest card played by one of the other. In case of a tie-winning trick played by two partners, whichever of them led to it first, leads two the next, and if neither of them two led, the trick is then spoilt just as if one of the tied cards were played by the other side.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Truco]]\n*[[Mus (card game)|Mus]]\n*[[Put (card game)|Put]]\n*[[Calabresella]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*El Truco: Historia de una Tradic\u00ed\u00f3n, Francisco Jos\u00e9 Fuentes Pereira  [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027184423/http://ar.geocities.com/trucoargentino/el_truco.pdf ], in Spanish \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pagat.com/put/truc.html Truc rules] at [[Pagat.com]]\n\n[[Category:15th-century card games]]\n[[Category:Put group]]\n[[Category:Spanish card games]]\n[[Category:French card games]]\n", "name_user": "Pol098", "label": "safe", "comment": "WP:OVERLINK", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truc"}

The battles resolved the [[military strategy|military strategies]] of the French Chief of Staff General [[Joseph Joffre]] with [[Plan XVII]] and an offensive interpretation of the [[German Empire|German]] {{lang|de|Aufmarsch II}} deployment plan by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]]. The Germans concentrated on their right (northern) flank, attempting to wheel through Belgium and attack the French in the rear.\n\nThe German advance was delayed by the movement of the French Fifth Army (General [[Charles Lanrezac]]) towards the north-west to intercept them and the presence of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the left flank of the French. The Franco-British troops were driven back by the Germans, who were able to invade northern France. French and British rearguard actions delayed the German advance, allowing the French time to transfer forces on the eastern frontier to the west to defend [[Paris]], resulting in the [[First Battle of the Marne]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{Main|Belgian Army order of battle (1914)}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of Frontiers, August-september 1914 Q70232.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Belgian troops, with machine-guns pulled by dogs, photographed during the Battle of the Frontiers}}]]\nBelgian military planning assumed that other powers would assist the Belgian Army to eject an invader and a formal alliance between France and Britain was not solidified by a potential German invasion, despite the [[Entente cordiale|Anglo-French Entente]] (1904). The Belgians judged that the British attitude towards their country had changed and that Belgium had come to be seen as a British protectorate. A General Staff was formed in 1910 but the {{lang|de|Chef d'\u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Arm\u00e9e}}, Lieutenant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville until May 1914. Moranville began planning for the concentration of the army and met Belgian railway officials on 29 July.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe Belgian army was to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the [[National redoubt of Belgium]], ready to face any border, while the [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Fortified Position of Namur]] were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment, in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise, in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river, with two divisions further forward at Li\u00e8ge and Namur.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\n===Schlieffen\u2013Moltke Plan===\n\n{{Main|Schlieffen Plan|German Army order of battle (1914)}}\n\n[[File:World War 1 Headlines R01.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Headline in ''[[Le Soir]]'', 4 August 1914}}]]\n[[Alfred von Schlieffen]], Chief of the [[German Empire|Imperial]] [[German General Staff]] (''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]], OHL'') from {{nowrap|1891\u20131906,}} devised plans for a decisive battle against the French army in Germany, Belgium or France. {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I West}} was a contingency plan for a Franco-German war, in which France (due to fewer numbers) would be on the defensive and Germany would attack by invading Belgium between Antwerp and Namur to advance south and breach the Verdun\u2013Marne\u2013Paris defensive area. The German armies would then pause until railways could be repaired and supplies accumulated for a second offensive operation.{{sfn|Humphries|Maker|2013|pp=66, 69}} [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and became convinced that an isolated Franco-German war was impossible and that Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces would not be available to defend the Franco-German border as had been planned. {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} was abolished but in 1914 Moltke tried to apply the offensive strategy of {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} to the deployment plan {{lang|de|Aufmarsch II}} for a two-front war,\n\n{{quote|From his assessment of French defensive capability Schlieffen concluded that the German army would need at least 48.5 corps to succeed with an attack on France by way of Belgium, but Moltke planned to attack through Belgium with just 34 corps at his disposal in the west. The Schlieffen plan [sic] amounts to a critique of German strategy in 1914 since it clearly predicted the failure of Moltke\u2019s underpowered invasion of France. [...] Moltke followed the trajectory of the Schlieffen plan, but only up to the point where it was painfully obvious that he would have needed the ''army'' of the Schlieffen plan to proceed any further along these lines.{{sfn|Holmes|2014|pp=194, 211}}}}\n\nThe main German force tried to follow {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} to envelop the French armies on the left (north) and press them back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine rivers, unable to withdraw into central France. Moltke hoped that the French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine, on the common border.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=190, 172\u2013173, 178}}\n\n===Plan XVII===\n{{Main|Plan XVII}}\n\nUnder Plan XVII, the French peacetime army was to form five field armies of {{circa|2,000,000 men,}} with groups of Reserve divisions attached to each army and with a group of reserve divisions on the southern and northern flanks. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around [[\u00c9pinal]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and Verdun\u2013Mezi\u00e8res, with an army in reserve around [[Ste Menehould]] and [[Commercy]]. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General Staff sixteen lines to the German frontier against thirteen available to the German army; the French could wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium south of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and the [[Sambre]] rivers. French intelligence had obtained a map exercise of the German general staff of 1905, in which German troops had gone no further north than [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|p=194}}\n\nA German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and [[Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges|St. Di\u00e9]] was anticipated. The plan was an evolution of Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between \u00c9pinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from [[Montm\u00e9dy]] to [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. The Fourth Army was to be held back, west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and in 1911, during the [[Second Moroccan Crisis]], the French had been told that six divisions could be expected to operate around [[Maubeuge]].{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=195\u2013198}}\n\n===Declarations of war===\nAt midnight on {{nowrap|31 July/1 August,}} the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of {{lang|de|Kriegsgefahr}} during the day; the Ottoman government ordered mobilisation and the [[London Stock Exchange]] closed. On 1 August, the British government ordered the mobilisation of the navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier; the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium demanding free passage, as German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]] was bombarded by a German [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Augsburg}} and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August, the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British Government guaranteed military support to Belgium, should Germany invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August, the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany and declared war at midnight on {{nowrap|4/5 August,}} [[Central European Time]]. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops [[German invasion of Belgium|crossed the Belgian frontier]] and attacked Li\u00e8ge.{{sfn|Skinner|Stacke|1922|p=6}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===French offensive preparations===\n[[Joseph Joffre]], who had been Commander-in-Chief of the French army since 1911 and the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]], [[Adolphe Messimy]] met on 1 August, to agree that the military conduct of the war should exclusively be the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief. On 2 August, as small parties of German soldiers crossed the French border, Messimy told Joffre that he had the freedom to order French troops across the German but not the Belgian frontier. Joffre sent warning orders to the covering forces near the frontier, requiring the VII Corps to prepare to advance towards M\u00fchlhausen (Mulhouse) to the north-east of Belfort and XX Corps to make ready to begin an offensive towards Nancy. As soon as news arrived that German troops had entered Luxembourg, the Fourth Army was ordered to move between the Third and Fifth armies, ready to attack to the north of Verdun. Operations into Belgium were forbidden, to deny the Germans a pretext until 4 August, when it was certain that German troops had already violated the Belgian border. To comply with the Franco-Russian Alliance, Joffre ordered an invasion of Alsace-Lorraine on for 14 August, although anticipating a German offensive through Belgium.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nOn 8 August General Instruction No. 1 had ordered the Fifth Army to take a position on the left of the Fourth Army, ready to attack the southern flank of German force advancing from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and Mouzon, through the difficult terrain in between. All four corps covered this front until 12 August, when Joffre allowed General [[Charles Lanrezac]] to move I Corps north to Givet to oppose a potential German attempt to cross the Meuse between Givet and Namur {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} further north, which extended the army front to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. As Lanrezac became aware of the size of the German force in Belgium and wanted to reinforce the left flank by moving to Namur, Joffre refused to allow the army front to be extended to {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} and ordered Lanrezac to keep the army in a central position near M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, ready to oppose a German offensive from Mouzon to Namur. On 14 August Joffre and Lanrezac met but Joffre considered that only a few German cavalry and infantry parties had crossed the Meuse. With the BEF moving to Maubeuge and Hirson a redeployment of the Fifth Army would disrupt the deployment of the other armies. On 14 August a new intelligence report showed eight German corps between Luxembourg and Li\u00e8ge and by the next day Joffre allowed the move of the Fifth Army north, to operate beyond the Meuse. The XI Corps was transferred to the Fourth Army and the XVIII Corps was moved from the Third Army to the Fifth Army, which was made responsible for the defence of Maubeuge.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=68\u201371}}\n\nJoffre began to dismiss commanders in early August, beginning with the VII Corps commander Bonneau and by 6 September had removed two army, ten corps and {{nowrap|38 divisional}} commanders, by transferring them to Limoges ({{lang|fr|Limog\u00e9}}). The VII Corps in the south was reinforced by two divisions, a cavalry division and the First Group of Reserve Divisions. The corps was renamed the Army of Alsace, to relieve the First Army of concern about Alsace during the operations in Lorraine. Two corps were removed from the Second Army and became a strategic reserve.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=60}} Joffre met Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] on 16 August and learned that the British could be ready by 24 August, Joffre also arranged for Territorial divisions to cover the area from Maubeuge to Dunkirk. The German siege of the Li\u00e8ge forts ended on 16 August and the 1st and 2nd armies with twelve corps and the 3rd Army with four corps began to advance behind cavalry screens. On 18 August, Joffre ordered the Fifth Army to prepare for a German offensive on both banks of the Meuse or to meet a small force on the north bank. The Fifth Army began to move towards Namur, in the angle of the Meuse and Sambre rivers on 19 August, which required a march of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} by some units.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=73}}\n\n===French plan of attack===\nOn 5 August, Joffre ordered an offensive by the VII Corps, on the right flank of the First Army, to begin on 7 August towards Mulhouse. The capture of the 2nd Army order of battle on 7 August, convinced Joffre that the strength of the German forces on the flanks had left the centre weak and vulnerable to an offensive towards [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Luxembourg Province|Neufch\u00e2teau]] and [[Arlon]].{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=216\u2013217}} On 8 August, Joffre issued General Instruction No. 1, containing his strategic intent, which was to destroy the German army rather than capture ground. The offensive into Alsace and that by the First and Second armies into Lorraine, would pin down German forces and attract reinforcements, as the main offensive further north drove in the German centre and outflanked the German forces in Belgium from the south. Joffre expected that the attack into the German centre would meet little resistance. The First and Second armies would advance south of the German fortified area from Metz\u2013Thionville, with the Fourth Reserve Group guarding the northern flank near Hirson, to watch the Chimay Gap and deflect a German attack from the north or east. The strategy assumed that the main German force would be deployed around Luxembourg and from Metz\u2013Thionville, with smaller forces in Belgium. On 9 August, an intelligence report had one German active corps near Freiburg close to the Swiss border, three near Strasbourg, four in Luxembourg to the north of Thionville and six from Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, towards the north end of Luxembourg, which left five corps un-located. The French general staff inferred that they were between Metz-Thionville and Luxembourg, ready to advance towards Sedan or M\u00e9zi\u00e8res.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=56\u201358}}\n\nJoffre set 14 August as the date when the First and Second armies were to invade Lorraine between Toul and \u00c9pinal, south of the German fortified area of Metz-Thionville. The First Army was to attack in the south with four corps, towards Sarrebourg {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Nancy and Donon {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Sarrebourg. Passes in the Vosges to the south of Donon were to be captured before the main advance began. The Second Army was to attack towards Morhange {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of Nancy, with two corps north of the First Army and three advancing successively behind the left flank of the corps to the south, to counter a German attack from Metz. The French offensive was complicated by the two armies diverging as they advanced, on difficult terrain particularly in the south, the combined fronts eventually being {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=58\u201359}} The advances of the First and Second armies were to attract German forces towards the south, while a French manoeuvre took place in Belgium and Luxembourg, to pierce a weak point in the German deployment and then destroy the main German armies.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nNews that German forces were attacking towards the Meuse bridges south of Namur, led Joffre to expect a German attack from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res to Givet, {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} further north, intended to envelop the French northern flank and another force to try to cross the Meuse from Montm\u00e9dy to Sedan. On 12 August, Joffre allowed Lanrezac to move the [[French I Corps|I Corps]] west to [[Dinant]] on the Meuse and on 15 August, Joffre ordered the bulk of the Fifth Army to move north-west behind the Sambre. No large German force was expected to cross to the north of the Meuse, which made the French general staff certain that the German centre was weaker than expected. On 18 August, Joffre directed the Third, Fourth and Fifth armies, together with the Belgians and British, to attack the German armies around Thionville and Luxembourg, where {{nowrap|13\u201315 German}} corps were thought to have assembled. The Third and Fourth armies were to defeat German forces between Thionville and Bastogne, as they attacked westwards towards Montm\u00e9dy and Sedan. The Fifth Army was to intercept German forces advancing towards Givet and then the Fourth Army was to swing north and attack the southern flank of the German armies. The Third and Fourth armies would defeat decisively the main German armies in the west and for this, two more corps were added to the four in the Fourth Army, taken from the flanking armies.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\n== Alsace ==\n\n===Battle of Mulhouse, 7\u201310 August===\n{{main|Battle of Mulhouse}}\n[[File:French capture of Mulhouse, 8 August 1914.jpg|thumb|{{centre|French capture of Mulhouse, 8 August 1914}}]]\nThe first French offensive of the war, known as the [[Battle of Mulhouse]], began on 7 August. Joffre had directed the First and Second armies to engage as many German divisions as possible to assist French forces operating further north. The French VII Corps with the 14th and 41st divisions, under the command of General Bonneau, advanced from Belfort to [[Mulhouse]] and [[Colmar]] {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north-east.

The First Army commander General [[Auguste Dubail]] preferred to dig in and complete the army mobilisation but Joffre ordered the advance to continue. With the arrival of two corps of the German 7th Army from [[Strasbourg]], the Germans mounted a counter-attack on the morning of 9 August, at nearby [[Cernay, Haut-Rhin|Cernay]].

The Army of Alsace began a new offensive against four ''[[Landwehr]]'' brigades, the VII Corps advancing from Belfort with two divisions on the right passing through [[Dannemarie, Haut-Rhin|Dannemarie]], at the head of the valley of the [[Ill (France)|Ill]]. On the left flank, two divisions advanced in co-operation with Chasseur battalions, which had moved into the Fecht valley on 12 August. On the evening of 14 August, Thann was captured and the most advanced troops had passed beyond the suburbs of Thann, Cernay and Dannemarie on the western outskirts of the city by 16 August. On 18 August, the VII Corps attacked Mulhouse and captured Altkirch on the south-eastern flank as the northern flank advanced towards Colmar and Neuf-Breisach.{{sfn|Michelin|1920|p=37}}\n\nThe German defenders were forced back from high ground to the west of Mulhouse on both banks of the [[Doller (river)|Doller]] and into the Mulhouse suburbs, where a [[urban warfare|house-to-house battle]] took place. The streets and houses of Dornach were captured systematically and by the evening of 19 August the French had recaptured the city. After being overrun, the Germans withdrew hastily through the Hardt forest to avoid being cut off and crossed the Rhine pursued by the French, retreating to [[Ensisheim]], {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north.

The French consolidated the captured ground and prepared to continue the offensive but on 23 August preparations were suspended, as news arrived of the defeats in Lorraine and Belgium; instead the French withdrew and consolidated the ridge beyond the [[Fortified region of Belfort]]. On 26 August the French withdrew from Mulhouse to a more defensible line near Altkirch, to provide reinforcements for the French armies closer to Paris.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=131\u2013132}} The Army of Alsace was disbanded and the VII Corps was transferred to the Somme.

One corps and the Second Group of Reserve Divisions advanced slowly towards [[Morhange]] in [[Echelon formation|echelon]], as a flank guard against a German attack from Metz. The First Army had captured several passes further south since 8 August, to protect the southern flank as the army advanced to Donon and Sarrebourg. Despite warnings from Joffre against divergence, the army was required to advance towards the Vosges passes to the south-east, eastwards towards Donon and north-east towards Sarrebourg. German troops withdrew during the day, Donon was captured and on the left flank an advance of {{convert|10|\u2013|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} was made. At dusk, the 26th Division of the XIII Corps attacked Cirey but was repulsed by massed artillery and machine-gun fire and suffered a costly repulse. On 15 August, the Second Army reported that German long-range artillery had been able to bombard the French artillery and infantry undisturbed and that dug-in German infantry had inflicted many casualties on the French as they attacked.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nThe Second Army had to attack methodically after artillery preparation but managed to push back the German defenders.

On 16 August, the Germans opposed the advance with long-range artillery fire and on 17 August, the First Army reinforced the advance on Sarrebourg. When the Germans were found to have left the city Joffre ordered the Second Army to incline further to the north, which had the effect of increasing the divergence of the French armies. A German counter-attack on 20 August forced separate battles on the French armies, which were defeated and forced to retreat in disorder. The German pursuit was slow and Castelnau was able to occupy positions east of Nancy and extend the right wing towards the south, to regain touch with the First Army. During 22 August, the right flank was attacked and driven back {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the position where the offensive had begun on 14 August.

On 19 August, the Fourth army of General [[Fernand de Langle de Cary]], was ordered to occupy the bridges over the Semois but not to advance into Belgium until the German offensive began. A premature attack would advance into a trap, rather than give time for the Germans to empty Luxembourg of troops before the French advanced. On 20 August the German armies in the south attacked the French first and Second armies and next day the Third and Fourth armies began their offensive. The Fourth Army crossed the Semois and advanced towards Neufch\u00e2teau and the Third Army of General [[Pierre Ruffey]] attacked towards Arlon, as a right flank guard for the Fourth army.\n\nSouth of Verdun, the Third Army was renamed Army of Lorraine and was to watch for a German offensive from Metz, which left the remainder of the Third Army free to concentrate on the offensive into Belgium.

On the southern flank, the VI Corps was pushed back a short distance. In the Fourth Army area, the II Corps on the right flank managed to keep level with the Third Army to the south but was not able to advance further.

The offensive of the Third and Fourth armies was defeated from {{nowrap|21\u201323 August}} and the Fifth Army was defeated on the Sambre and forced to retreat during the same period. Joffre's strategy had failed due to an underestimation of the German armies and the dispersion of the French offensive effort. With a large German force operating in Belgium, the German centre had appeared to be vulnerable to the Third and Fourth armies. The mistaken impression of the size of the German force in Belgium or its approach route was not as significant as the faulty information about the strength of the German armies opposite the Third and Fourth armies. Joffre blamed others and claimed that the French infantry had failed to show offensive qualities, despite outnumbering the German armies at their most vulnerable point, a claim that Robert Doughty in 2005 called \"pure balderdash\".{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe reality was that many of the French casualties were said to have come from an excess of offensive spirit and on 23 August, Ruffey concluded that the infantry had attacked without artillery preparation or support during the attack.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=71\u201376}} Early on 24 August, Joffre ordered a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and Maubeuge and began to transfer troops from the east opposite the German border, to the western flank. The French armies were to destroy railway facilities and inflict as many casualties as possible on the German armies, preparatory to resuming the offensive. Two strategic alternatives were possible, to attack the eastern flank of the 1st Army or to envelop the western flank of all the German armies. On 25 August, Joffre issued General Instruction No. 2, for a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to Reims and Amiens and the assembly of two corps and four reserve divisions near Amiens, for the envelopment operation.

An attempt by Moltke to withdraw troops from the 6th Army, to join a new 7th Army being formed for operations on the Oise failed when Rupprecht and Dellmensingen were backed by the Emperor who was at the 6th Army headquarters.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=316\u2013317}}{{efn|The German Emperor waited in the 6th Army headquarters at Dieuze to be present at a great victory but returned to Luxembourg in the evening.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}}} German attacks continued on 6 September and the XX Corps conducted a counter-attack which gave the defenders a short period to recuperate but the troops of the 2nd Group of Reserve Divisions, east and north of Nancy, began to give way.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}\n\nOn 7 September German attacks further north drove a salient into the French defences south of Verdun at St Mihiel, which could force apart the Second and Third armies.{{sfn|Spears|1999|pp=551\u2013552, 554}} At Nancy, part of the 59th Reserve Division retreated from the height of St. Genevi\u00e8ve, which overlooked the Grand Couronn\u00e9 north-west of Nancy, exposing the left flank of the Second Army and Nancy to envelopment. Castelnau ordered a withdrawal from Nancy but the move was circumvented by his staff; Castelnau was ordered by Joffre to maintain the defence of the Grand Couronn\u00e9 for another {{nowrap|24 hours.}}{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}{{efn|Castelnau had received news that one of his sons had been killed and gave the orders while under the impact.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}}}The French abandonment of the height of St. Genevi\u00e8ve went unnoticed by the Germans, who had retired during the afternoon and the height was reoccupied. German attacks continued until the morning of 8 September but then became less powerful as Moltke began to withdraw troops to the right flank of the German armies. Moltke sent Major Roeder to the 6th Army with orders to end the offensive and prepare to retire to the frontier; only at this point did Rupprecht find out that the armies near Paris were under severe pressure. The attacks by the 6th Army diminished and on 10 September the army began to withdraw towards the frontier.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} On the 13 September, [[Pont-\u00e0-Mousson]] and Lun\u00e9ville were recaptured by the French unopposed and the French armies closed up to the [[Seille (Moselle)|Seille]] river, where the front stabilised until 1918.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=253, 257}}\n\n====First Battle of the Marne, 5\u201312 September====\n{{Main|First Battle of the Marne}}\n[[Image:Battle of the Marne - Map.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Battle of the Marne, 1914}}]]\nJoffre used the railways which had transported French troops to the German frontier to move troops back from Lorraine and Alsace to form a new Sixth Army under General [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury]] with nine divisions and two cavalry divisions. By 10 September twenty divisions and three cavalry divisions had been moved west from the German border to the French centre and left and the balance of force between the German {{nowrap|1st\u20133rd armies}} and the Third, Fourth, Ninth, Fifth armies, the BEF and Sixth Army had changed to {{nowrap|44:56 divisions.}} Late on 4 September Joffre ordered the Sixth Army to attack eastwards over the Ourcq towards Ch\u00e2teau Thierry as the BEF advanced towards Montmirail and the Fifth Army attacked northwards, with its right flank protected by the Ninth Army along the St. Gond marshes. The French First\u2013Fourth armies to the east were to resist the attacks of the German {{nowrap|5th\u20137th armies}} between Verdun and Toul and repulse an enveloping attack on the defences south of Nancy from the north. The 6th and 7th armies were reinforced by heavy artillery from Metz and attacked again on 4 September along the Moselle.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=243\u2013253}}\n\nOn 5 September the Sixth Army advanced eastwards from Paris and met the German IV Reserve Corps, which had moved into the area that morning and stopped the French short of high ground north of Meaux. Overnight the IV Reserve Corps withdrew to a better position {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east and French air reconnaissance observed German forces moving north to face the Sixth Army. General [[Alexander von Kluck]] the 1st Army commander, ordered the II Corps to move back to the north bank of the Marne, which began a redeployment of all four 1st Army corps to the north bank by 8 September. The swift move to the north bank prevented the Sixth Army from crossing the Ourcq but created a gap between the 1st and 2nd Armies. The BEF advanced from 6 to 8 September, crossed the Petit Morin, captured bridges over the Marne and established a bridgehead {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep. The Fifth Army also advanced into the gap and by 8 September crossed the Petit Morin, which forced B\u00fclow to withdraw the right flank of the 2nd Army. Next day the Fifth Army re-crossed the Marne and the German 1st and 2nd armies began to retire as the French Ninth, Fourth and Third armies fought defensive battles with the 3rd Army which was forced to retreat with the 1st and 2nd armies on 9 September.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=92\u201395}}\n\nFurther east the Third Army was forced back to the west of Verdun as German attacks were made on the Meuse Heights to the south-east but managed to maintain contact with Verdun and the Fourth Army to the west. German attacks against the Second Army south of Verdun from 5 September almost forced the French to retreat but on 8 September the crisis eased. By 10 September the German armies west of Verdun were retreating towards the Aisne and the Franco-British were following up, collecting stragglers and equipment. On 12 September Joffre ordered an outflanking move to the west and an attack northwards by the Third Army to cut off the German retreat. The pursuit was too slow and on 14 September, the German armies dug in north of the Aisne and the Allies met trench lines rather than rearguards. Frontal attacks by the Ninth, Fifth and Sixth armies were repulsed on {{nowrap|15\u201316 September,}} which led Joffre to begin the transfer of the Second Army west to the left flank of the Sixth Army, the first phase of the [[Race to the Sea]], reciprocal attempts by the contending armies to outflank their opponent, which from 17 September to {{nowrap|17\u201319 October}} moved the opposing armies through Picardy and Flanders to the North Sea coast.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Churchill|1938}}\n|last=Churchill |first=W.

The battles resolved the [[military strategy|military strategies]] of the French Chief of Staff General [[Joseph Joffre]] with [[Plan XVII]] and an offensive interpretation of the [[German Empire|German]] {{lang|de|Aufmarsch II}} deployment plan by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]]. The German concentration on the right (northern) flank, to wheel through Belgium and attack the French in the rear.\n\nThe German advance was delayed by the movement of French Fifth Army (General [[Charles Lanrezac]]) towards the north-west to intercept them and the presence of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on left flank of the French. The Franco-British troops were driven back by the Germans, who were able to invade northern France. French and British rearguard actions delayed the German advance, allowing the French time to transfer forces on the eastern frontier to the west to defend [[Paris]], resulting in the [[First Battle of the Marne]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{Main|Belgian Army order of battle (1914)}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of Frontiers, August-september 1914 Q70232.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Belgian troops, with machine-guns pulled by dogs, photographed during the Battle of the Frontiers}}]]\nBelgian military planning assumed that other powers would assist the Belgian Army to eject an invader and a formal alliance between France and Britain was not solidified by a potential German invasion, despite the [[Entente cordiale|Anglo-French Entente]] (1904). The Belgians judged that the British attitude towards their country had changed and that Belgium had come to be seen as a British protectorate. A General Staff was formed in 1910 but the {{lang|de|Chef d'\u00c9tat-Major G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Arm\u00e9e}}, Lieutenant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville until May 1914. Moranville began planning for the concentration of the army and met Belgian railway officials on 29 July.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nThe Belgian army was to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the [[National redoubt of Belgium]], ready to face any border, while the [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Fortified Position of Namur]] were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment, in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise, in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river, with two divisions further forward at Li\u00e8ge and Namur.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\n===Schlieffen\u2013Moltke Plan===\n\n{{Main|Schlieffen Plan|German Army order of battle (1914)}}\n\n[[File:World War 1 Headlines R01.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Headline in ''[[Le Soir]]'', 4 August 1914}}]]\n[[Alfred von Schlieffen]], Chief of the [[German Empire|Imperial]] [[German General Staff]] (''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]], OHL'') from {{nowrap|1891\u20131906,}} devised plans for a decisive battle against the French army in Germany, Belgium or France. {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I West}} was a contingency plan for a Franco-German war, in which France (due to fewer numbers) would be on the defensive and Germany would attack by invading Belgium between Antwerp and Namur to advance south and breach the Verdun\u2013Marne\u2013Paris defensive area. The German armies would then pause until railways could be repaired and supplies accumulated for a second offensive operation.{{sfn|Humphries|Maker|2013|pp=66, 69}} [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and became convinced that an isolated Franco-German war was impossible and that Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces would not be available to defend the Franco-German border as had been planned. {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} was abolished but in 1914 Moltke tried to apply the offensive strategy of {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} to the deployment plan {{lang|de|Aufmarsch II}} for a two-front war,\n\n{{quote|From his assessment of French defensive capability Schlieffen concluded that the German army would need at least 48.5 corps to succeed with an attack on France by way of Belgium, but Moltke planned to attack through Belgium with just 34 corps at his disposal in the west. The Schlieffen plan [sic] amounts to a critique of German strategy in 1914 since it clearly predicted the failure of Moltke\u2019s underpowered invasion of France. [...] Moltke followed the trajectory of the Schlieffen plan, but only up to the point where it was painfully obvious that he would have needed the ''army'' of the Schlieffen plan to proceed any further along these lines.{{sfn|Holmes|2014|pp=194, 211}}}}\n\nThe main German force tried to follow {{lang|de|Aufmarsch I}} to envelop the French armies on the left (north) and press them back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine rivers, unable to withdraw into central France. Moltke hoped that the French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine, on the common border.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=190, 172\u2013173, 178}}\n\n===Plan XVII===\n{{Main|Plan XVII}}\n\nUnder Plan XVII, the French peacetime army was to form five field armies of {{circa|2,000,000 men,}} with groups of Reserve divisions attached to each army and with a group of reserve divisions on the southern and northern flanks. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around [[\u00c9pinal]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and Verdun\u2013Mezi\u00e8res, with an army in reserve around [[Ste Menehould]] and [[Commercy]]. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General Staff sixteen lines to the German frontier against thirteen available to the German army; the French could wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium south of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and the [[Sambre]] rivers. French intelligence had obtained a map exercise of the German general staff of 1905, in which German troops had gone no further north than [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|p=194}}\n\nA German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and [[Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges|St. Di\u00e9]] was anticipated. The plan was an evolution of Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between \u00c9pinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from [[Montm\u00e9dy]] to [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. The Fourth Army was to be held back, west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and in 1911, during the [[Second Moroccan Crisis]], the French had been told that six divisions could be expected to operate around [[Maubeuge]].{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=195\u2013198}}\n\n===Declarations of war===\nAt midnight on {{nowrap|31 July/1 August,}} the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of {{lang|de|Kriegsgefahr}} during the day; the Ottoman government ordered mobilisation and the [[London Stock Exchange]] closed. On 1 August, the British government ordered the mobilisation of the navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier; the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium demanding free passage, as German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]] was bombarded by a German [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Augsburg}} and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August, the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British Government guaranteed military support to Belgium, should Germany invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August, the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany and declared war at midnight on {{nowrap|4/5 August,}} [[Central European Time]]. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops [[German invasion of Belgium|crossed the Belgian frontier]] and attacked Li\u00e8ge.{{sfn|Skinner|Stacke|1922|p=6}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===French offensive preparations===\n[[Joseph Joffre]], who had been Commander-in-Chief of the French army since 1911 and the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]], [[Adolphe Messimy]] met on 1 August, to agree that the military conduct of the war should exclusively be the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief. On 2 August, as small parties of German soldiers crossed the French border, Messimy told Joffre that he had the freedom to order French troops across the German but not the Belgian frontier. Joffre sent warning orders to the covering forces near the frontier, requiring the VII Corps to prepare to advance towards M\u00fchlhausen (Mulhouse) to the north-east of Belfort and XX Corps to make ready to begin an offensive towards Nancy. As soon as news arrived that German troops had entered Luxembourg, the Fourth Army was ordered to move between the Third and Fifth armies, ready to attack to the north of Verdun. Operations into Belgium were forbidden, to deny the Germans a pretext until 4 August, when it was certain that German troops had already violated the Belgian border. To comply with the Franco-Russian Alliance, Joffre ordered an invasion of Alsace-Lorraine on for 14 August, although anticipating a German offensive through Belgium.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nOn 8 August General Instruction No. 1 had ordered the Fifth Army to take a position on the left of the Fourth Army, ready to attack the southern flank of German force advancing from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and Mouzon, through the difficult terrain in between. All four corps covered this front until 12 August, when Joffre allowed General [[Charles Lanrezac]] to move I Corps north to Givet to oppose a potential German attempt to cross the Meuse between Givet and Namur {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} further north, which extended the army front to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. As Lanrezac became aware of the size of the German force in Belgium and wanted to reinforce the left flank by moving to Namur, Joffre refused to allow the army front to be extended to {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} and ordered Lanrezac to keep the army in a central position near M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, ready to oppose a German offensive from Mouzon to Namur. On 14 August Joffre and Lanrezac met but Joffre considered that only a few German cavalry and infantry parties had crossed the Meuse. With the BEF moving to Maubeuge and Hirson a redeployment of the Fifth Army would disrupt the deployment of the other armies. On 14 August a new intelligence report showed eight German corps between Luxembourg and Li\u00e8ge and by the next day Joffre allowed the move of the Fifth Army north, to operate beyond the Meuse. The XI Corps was transferred to the Fourth Army and the XVIII Corps was moved from the Third Army to the Fifth Army, which was made responsible for the defence of Maubeuge.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=68\u201371}}\n\nJoffre began to dismiss commanders in early August, beginning with the VII Corps commander Bonneau and by 6 September had removed two army, ten corps and {{nowrap|38 divisional}} commanders, by transferring them to Limoges ({{lang|fr|Limog\u00e9}}). The VII Corps in the south was reinforced by two divisions, a cavalry division and the First Group of Reserve Divisions. The corps was renamed the Army of Alsace, to relieve the First Army of concern about Alsace during the operations in Lorraine. Two corps were removed from the Second Army and became a strategic reserve.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=60}} Joffre met Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] on 16 August and learned that the British could be ready by 24 August, Joffre also arranged for Territorial divisions to cover the area from Maubeuge to Dunkirk. The German siege of the Li\u00e8ge forts ended on 16 August and the 1st and 2nd armies with twelve corps and the 3rd Army with four corps began to advance behind cavalry screens. On 18 August, Joffre ordered the Fifth Army to prepare for a German offensive on both banks of the Meuse or to meet a small force on the north bank. The Fifth Army began to move towards Namur, in the angle of the Meuse and Sambre rivers on 19 August, which required a march of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} by some units.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=73}}\n\n===French plan of attack===\nOn 5 August, Joffre ordered an offensive by the VII Corps, on the right flank of the First Army, to begin on 7 August towards Mulhouse. The capture of the 2nd Army order of battle on 7 August, convinced Joffre that the strength of the German forces on the flanks had left the centre weak and vulnerable to an offensive towards [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Luxembourg Province|Neufch\u00e2teau]] and [[Arlon]].{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=216\u2013217}} On 8 August, Joffre issued General Instruction No. 1, containing his strategic intent, which was to destroy the German army rather than capture ground. The offensive into Alsace and that by the First and Second armies into Lorraine, would pin down German forces and attract reinforcements, as the main offensive further north drove in the German centre and outflanked the German forces in Belgium from the south. Joffre expected that the attack into the German centre would meet little resistance. The First and Second armies would advance south of the German fortified area from Metz\u2013Thionville, with the Fourth Reserve Group guarding the northern flank near Hirson, to watch the Chimay Gap and deflect a German attack from the north or east. The strategy assumed that the main German force would be deployed around Luxembourg and from Metz\u2013Thionville, with smaller forces in Belgium. On 9 August, an intelligence report had one German active corps near Freiburg close to the Swiss border, three near Strasbourg, four in Luxembourg to the north of Thionville and six from Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, towards the north end of Luxembourg, which left five corps un-located. The French general staff inferred that they were between Metz-Thionville and Luxembourg, ready to advance towards Sedan or M\u00e9zi\u00e8res.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=56\u201358}}\n\nJoffre set 14 August as the date when the First and Second armies were to invade Lorraine between Toul and \u00c9pinal, south of the German fortified area of Metz-Thionville. The First Army was to attack in the south with four corps, towards Sarrebourg {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Nancy and Donon {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Sarrebourg. Passes in the Vosges to the south of Donon were to be captured before the main advance began. The Second Army was to attack towards Morhange {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of Nancy, with two corps north of the First Army and three advancing successively behind the left flank of the corps to the south, to counter a German attack from Metz. The French offensive was complicated by the two armies diverging as they advanced, on difficult terrain particularly in the south, the combined fronts eventually being {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=58\u201359}} The advances of the First and Second armies were to attract German forces towards the south, while a French manoeuvre took place in Belgium and Luxembourg, to pierce a weak point in the German deployment and then destroy the main German armies.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nNews that German forces were attacking towards the Meuse bridges south of Namur, led Joffre to expect a German attack from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res to Givet, {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} further north, intended to envelop the French northern flank and another force to try to cross the Meuse from Montm\u00e9dy to Sedan. On 12 August, Joffre allowed Lanrezac to move the [[French I Corps|I Corps]] west to [[Dinant]] on the Meuse and on 15 August, Joffre ordered the bulk of the Fifth Army to move north-west behind the Sambre. No large German force was expected to cross to the north of the Meuse, which made the French general staff certain that the German centre was weaker than expected. On 18 August, Joffre directed the Third, Fourth and Fifth armies, together with the Belgians and British, to attack the German armies around Thionville and Luxembourg, where {{nowrap|13\u201315 German}} corps were thought to have assembled. The Third and Fourth armies were to defeat German forces between Thionville and Bastogne, as they attacked westwards towards Montm\u00e9dy and Sedan. The Fifth Army was to intercept German forces advancing towards Givet and then the Fourth Army was to swing north and attack the southern flank of the German armies. The Third and Fourth armies would defeat decisively the main German armies in the west and for this, two more corps were added to the four in the Fourth Army, taken from the flanking armies.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\n== Alsace ==\n\n===Battle of Mulhouse, 7\u201310 August===\n{{main|Battle of Mulhouse}}\n[[File:French capture of Mulhouse, 8 August 1914.jpg|thumb|{{centre|French capture of Mulhouse, 8 August 1914}}]]\nThe first French offensive of the war, known as the [[Battle of Mulhouse]], began on 7 August. Joffre had directed the First and Second armies to engage as many German divisions as possible to assist French forces operating further north. The French VII Corps with the 14th and 41st divisions, under the command of General Bonneau, advanced from Belfort to [[Mulhouse]] and [[Colmar]] {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north-east. The French quickly seized the border town of [[Altkirch]] {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Mulhouse with a bayonet charge.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=57}} On 8 August, Bonneau cautiously continued the advance and occupied Mulhouse, shortly after its German occupants had left the town. The First Army commander General [[Auguste Dubail]] preferred to dig in and complete the army mobilisation but Joffre ordered the advance to continue. With the arrival of two corps of the German 7th Army from [[Strasbourg]], the Germans mounted a counter-attack on the morning of 9 August, at nearby [[Cernay, Haut-Rhin|Cernay]]. Mulhouse was recaptured on 10 August and Bonneau withdrew towards [[Belfort]] to escape a German encirclement.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=211\u2013212}}\n\nGeneral [[Paul Pau]] was put in command of a new [[French Army of Alsace (WWI)|Army of Alsace]] and Bonneau, the VII Corps commander, was {{lang|fr|Limog\u00e9}} (dismissed) by Joffre. VII Corps was reinforced with the 44th Division, the 55th Reserve Division, the 8th Cavalry Division and the 1st Group of Reserve Divisions (58th, 63rd and 66th Reserve divisions) to re-invade Alsace on 14 August, as part of the bigger offensive by the First and Second armies into Lorraine, which drew most of the German 7th Army northwards. The Army of Alsace began a new offensive against four ''[[Landwehr]]'' brigades, the VII Corps advancing from Belfort with two divisions on the right passing through [[Dannemarie, Haut-Rhin|Dannemarie]], at the head of the valley of the [[Ill (France)|Ill]]. On the left flank, two divisions advanced in co-operation with Chasseur battalions, which had moved into the Fecht valley on 12 August. On the evening of 14 August, Thann was captured and the most advanced troops had passed beyond the suburbs of Thann, Cernay and Dannemarie on the western outskirts of the city by 16 August. On 18 August, the VII Corps attacked Mulhouse and captured Altkirch on the south-eastern flank as the northern flank advanced towards Colmar and Neuf-Breisach.{{sfn|Michelin|1920|p=37}}\n\nThe German defenders were forced back from high ground to the west of Mulhouse on both banks of the [[Doller (river)|Doller]] and into the Mulhouse suburbs, where a [[urban warfare|house-to-house battle]] took place. The streets and houses of Dornach were captured systematically and by the evening of 19 August the French had recaptured the city. After being overrun, the Germans withdrew hastily through the Hardt forest to avoid being cut off and crossed the Rhine pursued by the French, retreating to [[Ensisheim]], {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north. The French captured {{nowrap|24 guns,}} {{nowrap|3,000 prisoners}} and considerable amounts of equipment.{{sfn|Michelin|1920|p=37}} With the capture of the Rhine bridges and valleys leading into the plain, the Army of Alsace had gained control of upper-Alsace. The French consolidated the captured ground and prepared to continue the offensive but on 23 August preparations were suspended, as news arrived of the defeats in Lorraine and Belgium; instead the French withdrew and consolidated the ridge beyond the [[Fortified region of Belfort]]. On 26 August the French withdrew from Mulhouse to a more defensible line near Altkirch, to provide reinforcements for the French armies closer to Paris.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=131\u2013132}} The Army of Alsace was disbanded and the VII Corps was transferred to the Somme.

One corps and the Second Group of Reserve Divisions advanced slowly towards [[Morhange]] in [[Echelon formation|echelon]], as a flank guard against a German attack from Metz. The First Army had captured several passes further south since 8 August, to protect the southern flank as the army advanced to Donon and Sarrebourg. Despite warnings from Joffre against divergence, the army was required to advance towards the Vosges passes to the south-east, eastwards towards Donon and north-east towards Sarrebourg. German troops withdrew during the day, Donon was captured and on the left flank an advance of {{convert|10|\u2013|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} was made. At dusk, the 26th Division of the XIII Corps attacked Cirey but was repulsed by massed artillery and machine-gun fire and suffered a costly repulse. On 15 August, the Second Army reported that German long-range artillery had been able to bombard the French artillery and infantry undisturbed and that dug-in German infantry had inflicted many casualties on the French as they attacked.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nThe Second Army had to attack methodically after artillery preparation but managed to push back the German defenders.

On 16 August, the Germans opposed the advance with long-range artillery fire and on 17 August, the First Army reinforced the advance on Sarrebourg. When the Germans were found to have left the city Joffre ordered the Second Army to incline further to the north, which had the effect of increasing the divergence of the French armies. A German counter-attack on 20 August forced separate battles on the French armies, which were defeated and forced to retreat in disorder. The German pursuit was slow and Castelnau was able to occupy positions east of Nancy and extend the right wing towards the south, to regain touch with the First Army.

On 19 August, the Fourth army of General [[Fernand de Langle de Cary]], was ordered to occupy the bridges over the Semois but not to advance into Belgium until the German offensive began. A premature attack would advance into a trap, rather than give time for the Germans to empty Luxembourg of troops before the French advanced. On 20 August the German armies in the south attacked the French first and Second armies and next day the Third and Fourth armies began their offensive. The Fourth Army crossed the Semois and advanced towards Neufch\u00e2teau and the Third Army of General [[Pierre Ruffey]] attacked towards Arlon, as a right flank guard for the Fourth army.\n\nSouth of Verdun, the Third Army was renamed Army of Lorraine and was to watch for a German offensive from Metz, which left the remainder of the Third Army free to concentrate on the offensive into Belgium.

The offensive of the Third and Fourth armies was defeated from {{nowrap|21\u201323 August}} and the Fifth Army was defeated on the Sambre and forced to retreat during the same period. Joffre's strategy had failed due to an underestimation of the German armies and the dispersion of the French offensive effort. With a large German force operating in Belgium, the German centre had appeared to be vulnerable to the Third and Fourth armies. The mistaken impression of the size of the German force in Belgium or its approach route was not as significant as the faulty information about the strength of the German armies opposite the Third and Fourth armies. Joffre blamed others and claimed that the French infantry had failed to show offensive qualities, despite outnumbering the German armies at their most vulnerable point, a claim that Robert Doughty in 2005 called \"pure balderdash\".{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=71}}\n\nThe reality was that many of the French casualties were said to have come from an excess of offensive spirit and on 23 August, Ruffey concluded that the infantry had attacked without artillery preparation or support during the attack.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=71\u201376}} Early on 24 August, Joffre ordered a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and Maubeuge and began to transfer troops from the east opposite the German border, to the western flank. The French armies were to destroy railway facilities and inflict as many casualties as possible on the German armies, preparatory to resuming the offensive. Two strategic alternatives were possible, to attack the eastern flank of the 1st Army or to envelop the western flank of all the German armies. On 25 August, Joffre issued General Instruction No. 2, for a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to Reims and Amiens and the assembly of two corps and four reserve divisions near Amiens, for the envelopment operation. Joffre called for much greater integration of the infantry and artillery and for more tactical dispersal of infantry to nullify German fire power.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=76\u201378}}\n\n===Casualties===\nIn ''The World Crisis'', Winston Churchill used figures from French parliamentary records of 1920 to give French casualties from 5 August to 5 September 1914 of {{nowrap|329,000 killed,}} wounded and missing, German casualties from August to November of {{nowrap|677,440 men}} and British casualties in August and September of {{nowrap|29,598 men.}}{{sfn|Churchill|1938|pp=1423\u20131425}} By the end of August, the French Army had suffered {{nowrap|75,000 dead,}} of whom {{nowrap|27,000 were}} killed on 22 August.

The BEF fought the Battle of Mons on 24 August, by when the French First and Second armies had been pushed back by attacks of the German 7th and 6th armies between St. Di\u00e9 and Nancy, the Third Army held positions east of Verdun against attacks by the 5th Army, the Fourth Army held positions from the junction with the Third Army south of Montm\u00e9dy, westwards to Sedan, Mezi\u00e8res and Fumay, facing the 4th Army and the Fifth Army was between Fumay and Maubeuge, with the 3rd Army advancing up the Meuse valley from Dinant and Givet into a gap between the Fourth and Fifth armies and the 2nd Army pressed forward into the angle between the Meuse and Sambre directly against the Fifth Army. On the far west flank of the French, the BEF prolonged the line from Maubeuge to Valenciennes against the 1st Army and Army Detachment von Beseler masked the Belgian army at Antwerp.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=128}}\n\nOn 26 August, German forces captured Valenciennes and began the [[Siege of Maubeuge]] {{nowrap|(24 August \u2013 7 September).}} Leuven (Louvain) was sacked by German troops and the [[Battle of Le Cateau]] was fought by the BEF and the 1st Army. Longwy was surrendered by its garrison and next day British Marines and a party of the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) landed at Ostend; Lille and Mezi\u00e8res were occupied by German troops. Arras was occupied on 27 August and a French counter-offensive began at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1914)]] (Battle of Guise {{nowrap|29\u201330 August).}} On 29 August the Fifth Army counter-attacked the 2nd Army south of the Oise, from Vervins to Mont Dorigny and west of the river from Mont Dorigny to Moy towards St. Quentin on the Somme, while the British held the line of the Oise west of La F\u00e8re.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=154}} Laon, La F\u00e8re, and Roye were captured by German troops on 30 August and Amiens the next day. On 1 September Craonne and Soissons were captured and on 5 September the BEF ended its retreat from Mons, German troops reached Claye, {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Paris, Reims was captured, German forces withdrew from Lille and the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (Battle of the Ourcq) {{nowrap|(5\u201312 September)}} began, marking the end of the Great Retreat of the western flank of the Franco-British armies.{{sfn|Skinner|Stacke|1922|p=9}}\n\nBy 4 September the First and Second armies had slowed the advance of the 7th and 6th armies west of St. Di\u00e9 and east of Nancy, from where the Second Army had withdrawn its left flank, to face north between Nancy and Toul. A gap between the left of the Second Army and the right of the Third Army at Verdun, which faced north-west, on a line towards Revigny against the 5th Army advance, west of the Meuse between Varennes and St. M\u00e9n\u00e9hould. The Fourth Army had withdrawn to Sermaize, west to the Marne at Vitry le Fran\u00e7ois and then across the river to Sompons, against the 4th Army, which had advanced from Rethel, to Suippes and the west of Chalons. The new Ninth Army held a line from Mailly against the 3rd Army, which had advanced from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, over the Vesle and the Marne west of Chalons. The 2nd Army had advanced from Marle on the Serre, across the Aisne and the Vesle, between Reims and Fismes to Montmort, north of the junction of the Ninth and Fifth armies at Sezanne. The Fifth Army and the BEF had withdrawn south of the Oise, Serre, Aisne and Ourq, pursued by the 2nd Army on a line from Guise to Laon, Vailly and Dormans and by the 1st Army from Montdidier, towards Compi\u00e8gne and then south-east towards Montmirail. The new French Sixth Army, linked with the left of the BEF, west of the Marne at Meaux, to Pontiose north of Paris. French garrisons were besieged at Strasbourg, Metz, Thionville, Longwy, Montm\u00e9dy and Maubeuge. The Belgian army was invested at Antwerp in the National redoubt and at fortress troops continued the defence of the Li\u00e8ge forts.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=173, 210}}\n\n====Battle of Grand Couronn\u00e9, 4\u201313 September====\n{{main|Battle of Grand Couronn\u00e9}}\n[[File:Verdun-St. Mihiel area, 9 September 1914.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Nancy area, September 1914}}]]\nThe German offensive began during the night of 3 September against the fortifications of the Grand Couronn\u00e9, either side of Nancy, which pushed back the 2nd Group of Reserve Divisions, comprising the 59th, 68th and 70th Reserve Divisions under General L\u00e9on Durand, to the north and the XX Corps of General Balfourier to the south, by the evening of 4 September. In the afternoon of 5 September Castelnau telegraphed to Joffre that he proposed to evacuate Nancy, to preserve the fighting power of the army. Next day Joffre replied that the Second Army was to hold the area east of Nancy if at all possible and only then retire to a line from the Forest of Haye to Saffais, Belchamp and Borville. The civilian authorities in the city had begun preparations for an evacuation but the troops on the Grand Couronn\u00e9 repulsed German attacks on the right flank, during 5 September. The Reserve divisions were only pushed back a short distance on the front to the east and north of Nancy. An attempt by Moltke to withdraw troops from the 6th Army, to join a new 7th Army being formed for operations on the Oise failed when Rupprecht and Dellmensingen were backed by the Emperor who was at the 6th Army headquarters.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=316\u2013317}}{{efn|The German Emperor waited in the 6th Army headquarters at Dieuze to be present at a great victory but returned to Luxembourg in the evening.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}}} German attacks continued on 6 September and the XX Corps conducted a counter-attack which gave the defenders a short period to recuperate but the troops of the 2nd Group of Reserve Divisions, east and north of Nancy, began to give way.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}\n\nOn 7 September German attacks further north drove a salient into the French defences south of Verdun at St Mihiel, which could force apart the Second and Third armies.{{sfn|Spears|1999|pp=551\u2013552, 554}} At Nancy, part of the 59th Reserve Division retreated from the height of St. Genevi\u00e8ve, which overlooked the Grand Couronn\u00e9 north-west of Nancy, exposing the left flank of the Second Army and Nancy to envelopment. Castelnau ordered a withdrawal from Nancy but the move was circumvented by his staff; Castelnau was ordered by Joffre to maintain the defence of the Grand Couronn\u00e9 for another {{nowrap|24 hours.}}{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}{{efn|Castelnau had received news that one of his sons had been killed and gave the orders while under the impact.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|p=317}}}}The French abandonment of the height of St. Genevi\u00e8ve went unnoticed by the Germans, who had retired during the afternoon and the height was reoccupied. German attacks continued until the morning of 8 September but then became less powerful as Moltke began to withdraw troops to the right flank of the German armies. Moltke sent Major Roeder to the 6th Army with orders to end the offensive and prepare to retire to the frontier; only at this point did Rupprecht find out that the armies near Paris were under severe pressure. The attacks by the 6th Army diminished and on 10 September the army began to withdraw towards the frontier.{{sfn|Tyng|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} On the 13 September, [[Pont-\u00e0-Mousson]] and Lun\u00e9ville were recaptured by the French unopposed and the French armies closed up to the [[Seille (Moselle)|Seille]] river, where the front stabilised until 1918.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=253, 257}}\n\n====First Battle of the Marne, 5\u201312 September====\n{{Main|First Battle of the Marne}}\n[[Image:Battle of the Marne - Map.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Battle of the Marne, 1914}}]]\nJoffre used the railways which had transported French troops to the German frontier to move troops back from Lorraine and Alsace to form a new Sixth Army under General [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury]] with nine divisions and two cavalry divisions. By 10 September twenty divisions and three cavalry divisions had been moved west from the German border to the French centre and left and the balance of force between the German {{nowrap|1st\u20133rd armies}} and the Third, Fourth, Ninth, Fifth armies, the BEF and Sixth Army had changed to {{nowrap|44:56 divisions.}} Late on 4 September Joffre ordered the Sixth Army to attack eastwards over the Ourcq towards Ch\u00e2teau Thierry as the BEF advanced towards Montmirail and the Fifth Army attacked northwards, with its right flank protected by the Ninth Army along the St. Gond marshes. The French First\u2013Fourth armies to the east were to resist the attacks of the German {{nowrap|5th\u20137th armies}} between Verdun and Toul and repulse an enveloping attack on the defences south of Nancy from the north. The 6th and 7th armies were reinforced by heavy artillery from Metz and attacked again on 4 September along the Moselle.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=243\u2013253}}\n\nOn 5 September the Sixth Army advanced eastwards from Paris and met the German IV Reserve Corps, which had moved into the area that morning and stopped the French short of high ground north of Meaux. Overnight the IV Reserve Corps withdrew to a better position {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east and French air reconnaissance observed German forces moving north to face the Sixth Army. General [[Alexander von Kluck]] the 1st Army commander, ordered the II Corps to move back to the north bank of the Marne, which began a redeployment of all four 1st Army corps to the north bank by 8 September. The swift move to the north bank prevented the Sixth Army from crossing the Ourcq but created a gap between the 1st and 2nd Armies. The BEF advanced from 6 to 8 September, crossed the Petit Morin, captured bridges over the Marne and established a bridgehead {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep. The Fifth Army also advanced into the gap and by 8 September crossed the Petit Morin, which forced B\u00fclow to withdraw the right flank of the 2nd Army. Next day the Fifth Army re-crossed the Marne and the German 1st and 2nd armies began to retire as the French Ninth, Fourth and Third armies fought defensive battles with the 3rd Army which was forced to retreat with the 1st and 2nd armies on 9 September.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=92\u201395}}\n\nFurther east the Third Army was forced back to the west of Verdun as German attacks were made on the Meuse Heights to the south-east but managed to maintain contact with Verdun and the Fourth Army to the west. German attacks against the Second Army south of Verdun from 5 September almost forced the French to retreat but on 8 September the crisis eased. By 10 September the German armies west of Verdun were retreating towards the Aisne and the Franco-British were following up, collecting stragglers and equipment. On 12 September Joffre ordered an outflanking move to the west and an attack northwards by the Third Army to cut off the German retreat. The pursuit was too slow and on 14 September, the German armies dug in north of the Aisne and the Allies met trench lines rather than rearguards. Frontal attacks by the Ninth, Fifth and Sixth armies were repulsed on {{nowrap|15\u201316 September,}} which led Joffre to begin the transfer of the Second Army west to the left flank of the Sixth Army, the first phase of the [[Race to the Sea]], reciprocal attempts by the contending armies to outflank their opponent, which from 17 September to {{nowrap|17\u201319 October}} moved the opposing armies through Picardy and Flanders to the North Sea coast.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Churchill|1938}}\n|last=Churchill |first=W.

He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]]. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]], he played for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]], Greater Manchester.

He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]].

After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season.

He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself.
