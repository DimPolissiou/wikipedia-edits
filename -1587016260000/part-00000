In 1552 [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Prince Alexander of Parma]] mounted several companies of infantry on [[pack horse]]s to achieve surprise.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\" /> Another early instance was ordered by [[Louis of Nassau]] in 1572 during operations near [[Mons]] in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], when 500 infantry were transported this way.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\">p. 330, Bismark</ref>  It is also suggested the first dragoons were raised by the Marshal [[Duke of Brissac|de Brissac]] in 1600.<ref>p. 331, Bismark</ref> According to old German literature, dragoons were invented by Count [[Ernst von Mansfeld]], one of the greatest German military commanders, in the early 1620s. There are other instances of mounted infantry predating this. However Mansfeld, who had learned his profession in Hungary and the Netherlands, often used horses to make his foot troops more mobile, creating what was called an \"arm\u00e9e volante\" ([[French Language|French]] for ''flying army'').\n\nIn the 16th century [[Conquest of Peru|Spanish civil wars in Peru]] [[conquistador]]s fought on horse with arquebuses, prefiguring the origin of European dragoons.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |url= |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7-48 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe name possibly derives from an early weapon, a short [[wheellock]] called a ''dragon'', because the first dragoons raised in France had their carbine's muzzle decorated with a dragon's head. The practice comes from a time when all gunpowder weapons had distinctive names, including the [[culverin]], serpentine, falcon, [[falconet (cannon)|falconet]], etc.<ref>p. 333, Bismark</ref>  It is also sometimes claimed a galloping infantryman with his loose coat and the burning match resembled a [[dragon]].<ref>p. 48, A Dictionary of Military Uniform W. Y. Carman {{ISBN|0-684-15130-8}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been suggested that the name derives from the German \"tragen\" or the Dutch \"dragen\", both being the verb \"to carry\" in their respective languages. [[Howard Reid (filmmaker)]] claims that the name and role descend from the Latin [[Draconarius]].<ref>p96, Arthur the Dragon King \u2013 The Barbaric Roots of Britain's Greatest Legend, Howard Reid, {{ISBN|0-7472-7558-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Use as a verb ===\nDragoon is occasionally used as a verb to mean to subjugate or persecute by the imposition of troops; and by extension to compel by any violent measures or threats. The term dates from 1689, at a time when dragoons were being used by [[Louis XIV|the French monarchy]] to [[Edict of Fontainebleau|persecute Protestants]], particularly by forcing [[Protestants]] to lodge a dragoon in their house to watch over them, at the householder's expense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/dragoon|title=the definition of dragoon|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early history and role ==\n\nEarly dragoons were not organized in [[squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]] or [[troop]]s as were cavalry, but in [[company (military unit)|companies]] like the infantry: their [[commissioned officer|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s bore infantry ranks. Dragoon regiments used  drummers, not buglers, to communicate orders on the battlefield. The flexibility of mounted infantry made dragoons a useful arm, especially when employed for what would now be termed \"[[internal security]]\" against smugglers or civil unrest, and on [[line of communication]] security duties. During the [[English Civil War]] dragoons were used for a variety of tasks: providing outposts, holding defiles or bridges in the front or rear of the main army, lining hedges or holding enclosures, and providing dismounted musketeers to support regular cavalry.<ref>Peter Young & Richard Holmes, page 42 \"The English Civil War\", {{ISBN|1-84022-222-0}}</ref>. In the closing stages of the [[Battle of Naseby]] [[Okey's Dragoons]], who had started the action as dismounted musketeers, got on their horses and charged, possibly the first time this was done. Supplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to recruit and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry.  When in the 17th century [[Gustav II Adolf]] introduced dragoons into the Swedish Army, he provided them with a sabre, an axe and a [[matchlock]] musket, utilizing them as \"labourers on horseback\".<ref>Richard Brzezinski, page 16  \"The Army of Gustavus Adolphus 2 - \", {{ISBN|1-85532-350-8}}</ref>  Many of the European armies henceforth imitated this all-purpose set of weaponry.\n\nA non-military use of dragoons was the 1681 [[Dragonnades]], a policy instituted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to intimidate [[Huguenot]] families into either leaving France or re-converting to [[Catholicism]] by [[billeting]] ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households. While other categories of infantry and cavalry were also used, the mobility, flexibility and available numbers of the dragoon regiments made them particularly suitable for repressive work of this nature over a wide area.\n\nIn the Spanish Army, Pedro de la Puente organized a body of dragoons in [[Innsbruck]] in 1635. In 1640, a [[tercio]] of a thousand dragoons armed with the [[arquebus]] was created in Spain. By the end of the 17th century, the Spanish Army had three tercios of dragoons in Spain, plus three in the [[Netherlands]] and three more in [[Milan]]. In 1704, the Spanish dragoons were reorganised into [[regiment]]s by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], as were the rest of the tercios.\n\nTowards the end of 1776, [[George Washington]] realized the need for a mounted branch of the American military.  In January 1777 four regiments of light dragoons were raised.  Short term enlistments were abandoned and the dragoons joined for three years, or \"the war\".  They participated in most of the major engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], including the Battles of [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], as well as the [[Yorktown campaign]].\n\nDragoons were at a disadvantage when engaged against true cavalry, and constantly sought to improve their horsemanship, armament and social status. By the [[Seven Years' War]] the primary role of dragoons in most European armies had progressed from that of mounted infantry to that of heavy cavalry.<ref>Dragoons are sometimes described as 'medium' cavalry, midway between heavy/armoured and light regiments, though this was a classification that was rarely given at the time. page 19 \"Napoleonic Cavalry\", Philip Haythornthwaite, {{ISBN|0-304-35508-9}}</ref> Earlier dragoon responsibilities for scouting and [[picket (military)|picket]] duty had  passed to [[hussars]] and similar light cavalry corps in the French, Austrian, Prussian, and other armies. In the [[Imperial Russian Army]], due to the availability of the [[Cossack]] troops, the dragoons were retained in their original role for much longer.\n\nAn exception to the rule was the British Army. To reduce military budgets, all horse (cavalry) regiments were gradually demoted to dragoons from 1746 onward \u2014 which meant they were paid on a lower scale. When this was completed in 1788, the heavy cavalry regiments had become either [[Dragoon Guards]] or Heavy Dragoons (depending on their precedence). The designation of Dragoon Guards did not mean that these regiments (the former 2nd to 8th Horse) had become Household Troops, but simply that they had been given a more dignified title to compensate for the loss of pay and prestige.<ref>Michael Barthorp, page 22 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>  Starting in 1756, seven regiments of Light Dragoons were raised. These Light Dragoons were trained in [[reconnaissance]], [[skirmish]]ing and other work requiring [[Endurance riding|endurance]] in accordance with contemporary standards of light cavalry performance. The success of this new class of cavalry was such that eight regular Dragoon regiments were converted to Light Dragoons between 1768 and 1783.<ref>page 24 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", Michael Barthorp, {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Helm eines k.u.k.

Dragoons rode larger horses than the light cavalry and wielded straight, rather than curved swords. Emperor [[Napoleon]] often formed complete divisions out of his 30 dragoon regiments<ref>In 1811 six regiments were converted to ''Chevau-Legers Lanciers''</ref> and used them as battle cavalry to break the enemy's main resistance.<ref>Rothenberg, p. 141</ref><ref>In northern and eastern Europe they were employed as heavy cavalry, while in the Iberian peninsula they fulfilled, in addition, the role of lighter cavalry, for example in anti-guerrilla operations. page 19 \"Napoleonic Cavalry\", Philip Haythornthwaite, {{ISBN|0-304-35508-9}}</ref> In 1809, French dragoons scored notable successes against Spanish armies at the [[Battle of Ocana]] and the [[Battle of Alba de Tormes]].\n\nBritish heavy dragoons made devastating charges against French infantry at the [[Battle of Salamanca]] in 1812 and at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. 31 regiments were in existence at the height of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]: seven Dragoon Guards regiments<ref>The seven Dragoon Guards regiments were the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|1st (King's) Dragoon Guards]], [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)]], [[3rd Dragoon Guards|3rd (Prince of Wales's) Dragoon Guards]], [[4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards|4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards]], [[5th Dragoon Guards|5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards]], [[Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards)|6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers)]] and the [[7th Dragoon Guards|7th (Princess Royal's) Dragoon Guards]].</ref> and 24 cavalry of the line regiments.<ref>The 24 cavalry of the line regiments were the [[1st The Royal Dragoons|1st (Royal) Dragoons]], the [[Royal Scots Greys|2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]], the [[3rd The King's Own Hussars|3rd (King's Own) Hussars]], the [[4th Queen's Own Hussars|4th (Queen's Own) Hussars]], the [[5th Royal Irish Lancers|5th (Royal Irish) Lancers]] (disbanded in 1799 and reformed in 1858), the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]], the [[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th (Queen's Own) Hussars]], the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars|8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars]], the [[9th Queen's Royal Lancers|9th (Queen's Royal) Lancers]], the [[10th Royal Hussars|10th (Prince of Wales's Own Royal) Hussars]], the [[11th Hussars|11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussars]], the [[12th Royal Lancers|12th (Prince of Wales's Royal) Lancers]], the [[13th Hussars]], the [[14th King's Hussars|14th (King's) Hussars]], the [[15th The King's Hussars|15th (The King's) Hussars]], the [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th (The Queen's) Lancers]], the [[17th Lancers|17th (Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers]], the [[18th Royal Hussars|18th (Queen Mary's Own) Royal Hussars]], the [[19th Royal Hussars|19th (Queen Alexandra's Own Royal) Hussars]], the [[20th Hussars]], the [[21st Lancers|21st (Empress of India's) Lancers]], the [[22nd Dragoons|22nd (Light) Dragoons]], the [[23rd Light Dragoons]], the [[24th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons]] and the [[25th Dragoons]] (renumbered as the 22nd Dragoons in 1802).</ref> The Dragoon Guards and Dragoon regiments were the heavy cavalry regiments of the British Army, although by continental standards they were not the heaviest type of cavalry since they carried no armour (unlike [[cuirassier]]s).<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=David|year=2004|title=Head dress of the British heavy cavalry: Dragoon Guards, Household and Yeomanry Cavalry |publisher=Schiffer Publishing|isbn=978-0-7643-0957-1}}</ref> While some of the cavalry regiments of the line were simply designated as regiments of ''dragoons'', the lighter cavalry regiments, which were particularly mobile, became regiments of ''[[Light Dragoons]]'', employing the [[Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre|1796-pattern light cavalry sabres]].<ref>Kannik, Prebben (1968), ''Military Uniforms in Colour'', Blandford Press, {{ISBN|0-7137-0482-9}} (p. 200)</ref> From 1805 four regiments of Light Dragoons were designated Hussars (7th, 10th, 15th and 18th Regiments), differentiated by uniform, and the wearing of mustaches.

In 1803, the regiments of dragoons began to be called light cavalry (C''azadores'') and dragoons disappeared from the Spanish Army shortly after 1815.\n\nIn [[New Spain]], soon to be [[M\u00e9xico]], dragoons were important and elite units of the Royal Army. A number of dragoons became important military and political figures, among them [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]], members of the Queen's Regiment of Dragoons who defected and then initiated [[Mexican War of Independence|the independence movement in M\u00e9xico]] in 1810. Another important dragoon was [[Agustin de Iturbide]], who would ultimately achieve Mexican independence in 1821. He was known as the greatest horseman in M\u00e9xico and became so renowned in battle during his youth that he acquired the nickname ''El Drag\u00f3n de Hierro'' or \"The Iron Dragon\" (in Spanish, \"dragon\" and \"dragoon\" both sound and are written exactly the same). He would go on to become Agust\u00edn I, after being elected Emperor of M\u00e9xico. The political importance of dragoons during this time in the nascent country cannot be overstated.\n[[File:Battle of Resaca de la Palma.jpg|thumb|left|220px|alt=Sepia print of cavalrymen cutting with swords at foot soldiers.

For the war [[2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|a second regiment]] was activated; that regiment was consolidated with the original regiment in 1814.

In the summer of 1835, the regiment blazed a trail along the [[Des Moines river]] and established outposts from present-day [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]]. In 1933, the State of Iowa opened the [[Dragoon Trail]], a scenic and historic drive that follows the path of the 1st United States Dragoons on their historic march.\n\nIn 1861 the two existing U.S. Dragoon regiments were re-designated as the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. This reorganization did not affect their role or equipment, although the traditional orange uniform braiding of the dragoons was replaced by the standard yellow of the Cavalry branch. This marked the official end of dragoons in the U.S. Army, although certain modern units trace their origins back to the historic dragoon regiments.\n\nIn several stages between 1816 and 1861, the 21 existing Light Dragoon regiments in the British Army were disbanded or converted to [[lancer]]s or [[hussar]]s.<ref>British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660, Michael Barthorp {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1881 and 1907 all Russian cavalry (other than [[Cossacks]] and [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] regiments) were designated as dragoons, reflecting an emphasis on the double ability of dismounted action as well as the new cavalry tactics in their training and a growing acceptance of the impracticality of employing historical [[cavalry tactics]] against modern firepower. Upon the reinstatement of Uhlan and Hussar Regiments in 1907 their training pattern, as well as that of the Cuirassiers of the Guard, remained unchanged until the collapse of the Russian Imperial Army.<ref>Cavalry/Encyclopaedia Militera.

Note the functional [[Stahlhelm]] helmet.]]\nIn [[Japan]], in the late 19th century/early 20th century, dragoons were deployed in the same way as in other armies, but were dressed as [[hussars]].\n\n== 20th century ==\nIn 1914 there were still dragoon regiments in the British, French, German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Peruvian, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Spanish armies. Their uniforms varied greatly, lacking the characteristic features of hussar or lancer regiments. There were occasional reminders of the mounted infantry origins of this class of soldier. Thus the 28 dragoon regiments of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] wore the [[Pickelhaube]] (spiked helmet) of the same design as those of the infantry<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages =324\u2013343|title=The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=3-902526-07-6}}</ref> and the British dragoons wore [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunics]] for full dress while hussars and all but one of the lancer regiments wore dark blue.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Barthorp|pages =183\u2013184|title=British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660|ISBN=0-7137-1043-8}}</ref> In other respects however dragoons had adopted the same tactics, roles and equipment as other branches of the cavalry and the distinction had become simply one of traditional titles. Weaponry had ceased to have a historic connection, with both the French and German dragoon regiments carrying lances during the early stages of World War I.\n\nThe historic German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian dragoon regiments ceased to exist as distinct branches following the overthrow of the respective imperial regimes of these countries during 1917\u201318. The Spanish dragoons, which dated back to 1640, were reclassified as numbered cavalry regiments in 1931 as part of the army modernization policies of [[Spanish Republic|the new republic]].\n\nThe [[Australian Light Horse]] were similar to 18th-century dragoon regiments in some respects, being mounted infantry which normally fought on foot, their horses' purpose being transportation. They served during the [[Second Boer War]] and [[World War I]]. The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade became famous for the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] in 1917 where they charged on horseback using rifle bayonets, since neither [[sabre]]s or [[lance]]s were part of their equipment. Later in the Palestine campaign Pattern 1908 Cavalry Swords were issued and used in the campaign leading to the fall of Damascus.\n\nProbably the last use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat was made by the [[Portuguese Army]] in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|war in Angola]] during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an experimental horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern [[Angola]], in which each soldier was armed with a [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] [[assault rifle]] for combat on foot and with an [[Semi-automatic pistol|automatic pistol]] to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to [[motor vehicle]]s and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no training or strategy to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the \"[[Dragoons of Angola]]\". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with [[airmobile]] forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from [[helicopter]] in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.<ref>CANN, Jonh P., \"Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974\", Hailer Publishing, 2005</ref>\n\n=== Dragoner rank ===\n[[File:German dragoons near Reims 1914.jpg|thumb|German dragoons near Reims 1914]]\nUntil 1918 '''''Dragoner''''' (en: dragoon) was the designation given to the lowest ranks in the dragoon regiments of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German Armies. The ''Dragoner'' rank, together with all other private ranks of the different branch of service, did belong to the so-called [[gemeine]] rank group.\n\n== Modern dragoons ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe [[President of Brazil|Brazilian president]]'s [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] is provided (amongst other units) by a regiment of dragoons: the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment of the [[Brazilian Army]].\n\nThis regiment is known as the \"Drag\u00f5es da Independ\u00eancia\" ([[Independence Dragoons]]). The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the [[Prince Royal of Portugal]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], at the time when he [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declared Brazilian independence]] from [[Portugal]], on September 7, 1822.\n\nThe Independence Dragoons wear 19th-century dress uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret|Debret]], in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Brazilian Empress Consort]] was also an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Archduchess]].<ref>{{cite web  |title=Ex\u00e9rcito Brasileiro \u2013 Bra\u00e7o Forte, M\u00e3o Amiga |url=http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093820/http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archivedate=2009-03-12 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The color of the plumes varies according to rank.

However dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century and, in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the [[Viceroy]] who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment \u2013 Vice-Roy Guard [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family. The Guard was later disbanded by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Peter II]] and would be recreated only later in the republican era.<ref>CARVALHO, Jos\u00e9 Murilo de. D. Pedro II: Ser ou n\u00e3o ser.

The [[Carabinier|Carabineros]] are the national [[police]] of [[Chile]]. The military counterpart, that of the 15th Reinforced Regiment \"Dragoons\" is now as of 2010 the 4th Armored Brigade \"Chorrillos\" based in [[Punta Arenas]] as the 6th Armored Cavalry Squadron \"Dragoons\", and form part of the 5th Army Division.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nThe Royal [[Danish Army]] includes amongst its historic regiments the [[Jydske Dragonregiment|Jutish Dragoon Regiment]], which was raised in 1670.\n\n=== Finland ===\n[[File:Ratsumieskilta riders.jpg|thumbnail|Finnish dragoons in 1922 uniform]]\nThe Finnish Dragoon squadron exists in conjunction with the Army Academy in [[Lappeenranta]] and continues the traditions of the former 1. Squadron of the [[Uusimaa]] Dragoon battalion.\n\n=== France ===\nThe modern [[French Army]] retains three dragoon regiments from the thirty-two in existence at the beginning of World War I: the [[2nd Dragoon Regiment (France)|2nd]], which is a nuclear, biological and chemical protection regiment, the [[5th Dragoon Regiment (France)|5th]], an experimental [[Combined arms]] regiment, and the [[13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment|13th]] (Special Reconnaissance).\n\n=== Lithuania ===\nBeginning in the 17th century, the mercenary army of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] included dragoon units. In the middle of the 17th century there were 1,660 dragoons in an army totaling 8,000 men. By the 18th century there were four regiments of dragoons. \n\nLithuanian cavalrymen served in dragoon regiments of both the Russian and Prussian armies, after the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\nBetween 1920\u20131924 and 1935\u20131940 the Lithuanian Army included the Third Dragoon ''Iron Wolf'' Regiment. The dragoons were the equivalent of the present-day [[Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces |Volunteer Forces]].\n\nIn modern Lithuania there is a dragoon battalion of the Grand Duke Butigeidis (''Lithuanian: did\u017eiojo kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Butigeid\u017eio drag\u016bn\u0173 batalionas'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kariuomene.kam.lt/lt/kariuomenes_struktura/kontaktai_1614/402.html|title=Lietuvos kariuomen\u0117 :: Kariuomen\u0117s strukt\u016bra \u00bb Kontaktai \u00bb Lietuvos did\u017eiojo kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Butigeid\u017eio drag\u016bn\u0173 batalionas|first=Fresh|last=Media|website=kariuomene.kam.lt}}</ref>\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn the [[Norwegian Army]] during the early part of the 20th century, dragoons served in part as mounted troops, and in part on skis or bicycles (''hjulryttere'', meaning \"wheel-riders\"). Dragoons fought on horses, bicycles and skis against the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion in 1940]]. After [[World War II]] the dragoon regiments were reorganized as [[armour]]ed [[reconnaissance]] units. \"Dragon\" is the rank of a compulsory service private cavalryman while enlisted (regular) cavalrymen have the same rank as infantrymen: \"Grenader\".\n\n=== Peru ===\n[[File:Dragones del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>Changing of the dragoon guard by the Field Marshal Nieto Regiment of Cavalry, Life-Guard of the President of the Republic of Peru </center>]]\nThe [[Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment|Presidential Escort Life Guard Dragoons Regiment \"Field Marshal Domingo Nieto\"]],  named after Field Marshal [[Domingo Nieto]], of the [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of the Republic of Per\u00fa]] were the traditional Guard of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] until March 5, 1987 and its disbandment in that year. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of February 2, 2012 the restoration of the Cavalry Regiment \"Marshal Domingo Nieto\" as the official escort of the President of the Republic of Peru was announced. The main mission of the reestablished regiment was to guarantee the security of the President of the Republic and of the Government Palace.\n\nThis regiment of dragoons was created in 1904 following the suggestion of a French military mission which undertook the reorganization of the [[Peruvian Army]] in 1896. The initial title of the unit was Cavalry Squadron \"President's Escort\". It was modelled on the French dragoons of the period. The unit was later renamed as the Cavalry Regiment \"President's Escort\" before receiving its current title in 1949.\n\nThe Peruvian Dragoon Guard has throughout its existence worn French-style uniforms of black tunic and red breeches in winter and white coat and red breeches in summer, with red and white plumed bronze helmets with the [[coat of arms of Peru]] and golden or red [[epaulettes]] depending on rank. They retain their original armament of [[lance]]s and [[sabre]]s, until the 1980s [[rifle]]s were used for dismounted drill.\n\nAt [[24-hour clock|13:00 hours]] every day, the main esplanade in front of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] fronting Lima's Main Square serves as the stage for the changing of the guard, undertaken by members of the Presidential Life Guard Escort Dragoons, mounted or dismounted. While the dismounted changing is held on Mondays and Fridays, the mounted ceremony is held twice a month on a Sunday.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe [[Portuguese Army]] still maintains two units which are descended from former regiments of dragoons. These are the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]] Dragoons\") and the 6th Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Chaves (Portugal)|Chaves]] Dragoons\"). Both regiments are, presently, armoured units. The [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade]]' Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 a unit from the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry \u2013 is known as the \"Paratroopers Dragoons\".\n\nDuring the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to combat the guerrillas in eastern [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]]. This unit was soon augmented, becoming a group of three squadrons, known as the \"[[Angola Dragoons]]\". The Angola Dragoons operated as mounted infantry \u2013 like the original dragoons \u2013 each soldier being armed with a [[pistol]] to fire when on horseback and with an [[automatic rifle]], to use when dismounted. A unit of the same type was being created in [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] when the war ended in 1974.\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Spanish Army]] began the training of a dragoon corps in 1635 under the direction of Pedro de la Puente at [[Innsbruck]]. In 1640 the first dragoon \"[[tercio]]\" was created, equipped with [[arquebus]]es and [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s. The number of dragoon tercios was increased to nine by the end of the [[17th century|XVII century]]: three garrisoned in [[Spain]], another three in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and the remainder in Milan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://caminoarocroi.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/los-dragones-infanteria-a-caballo-o-caballeria-desmontada/|title=Los dragones: \u00bfinfanter\u00eda a caballo, o caballer\u00eda desmontada?|date=2012-07-10|work=Camino a Rocroi|access-date=2018-12-02|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\nThe ''tercio''s were converted into a [[Regiment|regimental system]], beginning in 1704.

They also form the Dragoons Battalion of the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The Dragoons Battalion have roots that go back as far as 1523, making it one of the world's oldest military units still in service and the only mounted unit still retained by the Swedish Army. Horses are used for ceremonial purposes only, most often when the dragoons take part in the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace in Stockholm. \"''Livdragon''\" is the rank of a private cavalryman.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n[[File:Dragon IMG 3508.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbine of a Swiss dragoon, with the strap system allowing a quick draw while mounted. On display at Morges military museum.]]\nIn the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]], mounted dragoons existed until the early 1970s, when they were converted into Armoured Grenadiers units. The \"''Dragoner''\" had to prove he was able to keep a horse at home before entering the army. At the end of basic training they had to buy a horse at a reduced price from the army and to take it home together with equipment, uniform and weapon. In the \"yearly repetition course\" the dragoons served with their horses, often riding from home to the meeting point.\n\nThe abolition of the dragoon units, believed to be the last non-ceremonial horse cavalry in Europe, was a contentious issue in Switzerland. On 5 December 1972 the Swiss ''[[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]]'' approved the measure by 91 votes, against 71 for retention.<ref>{{cite web |title=11214 BRG |access-date=2014-02-01 |url=http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/gesch/1972/d_gesch_19720214_620.htm |date=1972 |publisher=National Council of Switzerland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201233741/http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/gesch/1972/d_gesch_19720214_620.htm |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the present-day [[British Army]] regular army, four regiments are designated as dragoons: The [[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]], The [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] ,the [[Royal Dragoon Guards]], and the [[Light Dragoons]].

The unit crest of the 48th Infantry designated the unit as Dragoons, purely a traditional designation.\n\nThe 1st Dragoons was reformed in the [[Vietnam War]] era as the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Squadron, 1st U.S. Cavalry]]. It served in the [[Iraq War]] and remains as the oldest cavalry unit, as well as the most decorated one, in the U.S. Army.  Today's modern 1\u20131 Cavalry is a scout/attack unit, equipped with [[MRAP]]s, [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M3A3 Bradley CFVs]], and [[Stryker]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/134457/planes_trains_and_ferries_11_cav_equipment_arrives_in_europe |title=1/1 CAV equipment arrives in Europe|publisher=army.mil}}</ref>\n\nAnother modern [[United States Army]] unit, informally known as the 2nd Dragoons, is the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry Regiment]].

In 1552 [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Prince Alexander of Parma]] mounted several companies of infantry on [[pack horse]]s to achieve surprise.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\" /> Another early instance was ordered by [[Louis of Nassau]] in 1572 during operations near [[Mons]] in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], when 500 infantry were transported this way.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\">p. 330, Bismark</ref>  It is also suggested the first dragoons were raised by the Marshal [[Duke of Brissac|de Brissac]] in 1600.<ref>p. 331, Bismark</ref> According to old German literature, dragoons were invented by Count [[Ernst von Mansfeld]], one of the greatest German military commanders, in the early 1620s. There are other instances of mounted infantry predating this. However Mansfeld, who had learned his profession in Hungary and the Netherlands, often used horses to make his foot troops more mobile, creating what was called an \"arm\u00e9e volante\" ([[French Language|French]] for ''flying army'').\n\nIn the 16th century [[Conquest of Peru|Spanish civil wars in Peru]] [[conquistador]]s fought on horse with arquebuses, prefiguring the origin of European dragoons.<ref name=Espino2012>{{cite journal |last1=Espino L\u00f3pez |first1=Antonio |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=El uso t\u00e1ctico de las armas de fuego en las guerras civiles peruanas (1538-1547) |url= |journal=Historica|language=Spanish |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=7-48 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe name possibly derives from an early weapon, a short [[wheellock]] called a ''dragon'', because the first dragoons raised in France had their carbine's muzzle decorated with a dragon's head.

The term dates from 1689, at a time when dragoons were being used by [[Louis XIV|the French monarchy]] to [[Edict of Fontainebleau|persecute Protestants]], particularly by forcing [[Protestants]] to lodge a dragoon in their house to watch over them, at the householder's expense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/dragoon|title=the definition of dragoon|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early history and role ==\n\nEarly dragoons were not organized in [[squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]] or [[troop]]s as were cavalry, but in [[company (military unit)|companies]] like the infantry: their [[commissioned officer|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s bore infantry ranks. Dragoon regiments used  drummers, not buglers, to communicate orders on the battlefield. The flexibility of mounted infantry made dragoons a useful arm, especially when employed for what would now be termed \"[[internal security]]\" against smugglers or civil unrest, and on [[line of communication]] security duties. During the [[English Civil War]] dragoons were used for a variety of tasks: providing outposts, holding defiles or bridges in the front or rear of the main army, lining hedges or holding enclosures, and providing dismounted musketeers to support regular cavalry.<ref>Peter Young & Richard Holmes, page 42 \"The English Civil War\", {{ISBN|1-84022-222-0}}</ref>. In the closing stages of the [[Battle of Naseby]] [[Okey's Dragoons]], who had started the action as dismounted musketeers, got on their horses and charged, possibly the first time this was done. Supplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to recruit and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry.  When in the 17th century [[Gustav II Adolf]] introduced dragoons into the Swedish Army, he provided them with a sabre, an axe and a [[matchlock]] musket, utilizing them as \"labourers on horseback\".<ref>Richard Brzezinski, page 16  \"The Army of Gustavus Adolphus 2 - \", {{ISBN|1-85532-350-8}}</ref>  Many of the European armies henceforth imitated this all-purpose set of weaponry.\n\nA non-military use of dragoons was the 1681 [[Dragonnades]], a policy instituted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to intimidate [[Huguenot]] families into either leaving France or re-converting to [[Catholicism]] by [[billeting]] ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households. While other categories of infantry and cavalry were also used, the mobility, flexibility and available numbers of the dragoon regiments made them particularly suitable for repressive work of this nature over a wide area.\n\nIn the Spanish Army, Pedro de la Puente organized a body of dragoons in [[Innsbruck]] in 1635. In 1640, a [[tercio]] of a thousand dragoons armed with the [[arquebus]] was created in Spain. By the end of the 17th century, the Spanish Army had three tercios of dragoons in Spain, plus three in the [[Netherlands]] and three more in [[Milan]]. In 1704, the Spanish dragoons were reorganised into [[regiment]]s by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], as were the rest of the tercios.\n\nTowards the end of 1776, [[George Washington]] realized the need for a mounted branch of the American military.  In January 1777 four regiments of light dragoons were raised.  Short term enlistments were abandoned and the dragoons joined for three years, or \"the war\".  They participated in most of the major engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], including the Battles of [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], as well as the [[Yorktown campaign]].\n\nDragoons were at a disadvantage when engaged against true cavalry, and constantly sought to improve their horsemanship, armament and social status. By the [[Seven Years' War]] the primary role of dragoons in most European armies had progressed from that of mounted infantry to that of heavy cavalry.<ref>Dragoons are sometimes described as 'medium' cavalry, midway between heavy/armoured and light regiments, though this was a classification that was rarely given at the time. page 19 \"Napoleonic Cavalry\", Philip Haythornthwaite, {{ISBN|0-304-35508-9}}</ref> Earlier dragoon responsibilities for scouting and [[picket (military)|picket]] duty had  passed to [[hussars]] and similar light cavalry corps in the French, Austrian, Prussian, and other armies. In the [[Imperial Russian Army]], due to the availability of the [[Cossack]] troops, the dragoons were retained in their original role for much longer.\n\nAn exception to the rule was the British Army. To reduce military budgets, all horse (cavalry) regiments were gradually demoted to dragoons from 1746 onward \u2014 which meant they were paid on a lower scale. When this was completed in 1788, the heavy cavalry regiments had become either [[Dragoon Guards]] or Heavy Dragoons (depending on their precedence). The designation of Dragoon Guards did not mean that these regiments (the former 2nd to 8th Horse) had become Household Troops, but simply that they had been given a more dignified title to compensate for the loss of pay and prestige.<ref>Michael Barthorp, page 22 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>  Starting in 1756, seven regiments of Light Dragoons were raised. These Light Dragoons were trained in [[reconnaissance]], [[skirmish]]ing and other work requiring [[Endurance riding|endurance]] in accordance with contemporary standards of light cavalry performance. The success of this new class of cavalry was such that eight regular Dragoon regiments were converted to Light Dragoons between 1768 and 1783.<ref>page 24 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", Michael Barthorp, {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Helm eines k.u.k.

In 1803, the regiments of dragoons began to be called light cavalry (C''azadores'') and dragoons disappeared from the Spanish Army shortly after 1815.\n\nIn [[New Spain]], soon to be [[M\u00e9xico]], dragoons were important and elite units of the Royal Army. A number of dragoons became important military and political figures, among them [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]], members of the Queen's Regiment of Dragoons who defected and then initiated [[Mexican War of Independence|the independence movement in M\u00e9xico]] in 1810. Another important dragoon was [[Agustin de Iturbide]], who would ultimately achieve Mexican independence in 1821. He was known as the greatest horseman in M\u00e9xico and became so renowned in battle during his youth that he acquired the nickname ''El Drag\u00f3n de Hierro'' or \"The Iron Dragon\" (in Spanish, \"dragon\" and \"dragoon\" both sound and are written exactly the same). He would go on to become Agust\u00edn I, after being elected Emperor of M\u00e9xico. The political importance of dragoons during this time in the nascent country cannot be overstated.\n[[File:Battle of Resaca de la Palma.jpg|thumb|left|220px|alt=Sepia print of cavalrymen cutting with swords at foot soldiers.

For the war [[2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|a second regiment]] was activated; that regiment was consolidated with the original regiment in 1814.

In the summer of 1835, the regiment blazed a trail along the [[Des Moines river]] and established outposts from present-day [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]]. In 1933, the State of Iowa opened the [[Dragoon Trail]], a scenic and historic drive that follows the path of the 1st United States Dragoons on their historic march.\n\nIn 1861 the two existing U.S. Dragoon regiments were re-designated as the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. This reorganization did not affect their role or equipment, although the traditional orange uniform braiding of the dragoons was replaced by the standard yellow of the Cavalry branch. This marked the official end of dragoons in the U.S. Army, although certain modern units trace their origins back to the historic dragoon regiments.\n\nIn several stages between 1816 and 1861, the 21 existing Light Dragoon regiments in the British Army were disbanded or converted to [[lancer]]s or [[hussar]]s.<ref>British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660, Michael Barthorp {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1881 and 1907 all Russian cavalry (other than [[Cossacks]] and [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] regiments) were designated as dragoons, reflecting an emphasis on the double ability of dismounted action as well as the new cavalry tactics in their training and a growing acceptance of the impracticality of employing historical [[cavalry tactics]] against modern firepower. Upon the reinstatement of Uhlan and Hussar Regiments in 1907 their training pattern, as well as that of the Cuirassiers of the Guard, remained unchanged until the collapse of the Russian Imperial Army.<ref>Cavalry/Encyclopaedia Militera.

Their uniforms varied greatly, lacking the characteristic features of hussar or lancer regiments. There were occasional reminders of the mounted infantry origins of this class of soldier. Thus the 28 dragoon regiments of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] wore the [[Pickelhaube]] (spiked helmet) of the same design as those of the infantry<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages =324\u2013343|title=The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=3-902526-07-6}}</ref> and the British dragoons wore [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunics]] for full dress while hussars and all but one of the lancer regiments wore dark blue.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Barthorp|pages =183\u2013184|title=British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660|ISBN=0-7137-1043-8}}</ref> In other respects however dragoons had adopted the same tactics, roles and equipment as other branches of the cavalry and the distinction had become simply one of traditional titles. Weaponry had ceased to have a historic connection, with both the French and German dragoon regiments carrying lances during the early stages of World War I.\n\nThe historic German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian dragoon regiments ceased to exist as distinct branches following the overthrow of the respective imperial regimes of these countries during 1917\u201318. The Spanish dragoons, which dated back to 1640, were reclassified as numbered cavalry regiments in 1931 as part of the army modernization policies of [[Spanish Republic|the new republic]].\n\nThe [[Australian Light Horse]] were similar to 18th-century dragoon regiments in some respects, being mounted infantry which normally fought on foot, their horses' purpose being transportation. They served during the [[Second Boer War]] and [[World War I]]. The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade became famous for the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] in 1917 where they charged on horseback using rifle bayonets, since neither [[sabre]]s or [[lance]]s were part of their equipment. Later in the Palestine campaign Pattern 1908 Cavalry Swords were issued and used in the campaign leading to the fall of Damascus.\n\nProbably the last use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat was made by the [[Portuguese Army]] in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|war in Angola]] during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an experimental horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern [[Angola]], in which each soldier was armed with a [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] [[assault rifle]] for combat on foot and with an [[Semi-automatic pistol|automatic pistol]] to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to [[motor vehicle]]s and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no training or strategy to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the \"[[Dragoons of Angola]]\". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with [[airmobile]] forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from [[helicopter]] in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.<ref>CANN, Jonh P., \"Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974\", Hailer Publishing, 2005</ref>\n\n=== Dragoner rank ===\n[[File:German dragoons near Reims 1914.jpg|thumb|German dragoons near Reims 1914]]\nUntil 1918 '''''Dragoner''''' (en: dragoon) was the designation given to the lowest ranks in the dragoon regiments of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German Armies. The ''Dragoner'' rank, together with all other private ranks of the different branch of service, did belong to the so-called [[gemeine]] rank group.\n\n== Modern dragoons ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe [[President of Brazil|Brazilian president]]'s [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] is provided (amongst other units) by a regiment of dragoons: the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment of the [[Brazilian Army]].\n\nThis regiment is known as the \"Drag\u00f5es da Independ\u00eancia\" ([[Independence Dragoons]]). The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the [[Prince Royal of Portugal]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], at the time when he [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declared Brazilian independence]] from [[Portugal]], on September 7, 1822.\n\nThe Independence Dragoons wear 19th-century dress uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret|Debret]], in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Brazilian Empress Consort]] was also an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Archduchess]].<ref>{{cite web  |title=Ex\u00e9rcito Brasileiro \u2013 Bra\u00e7o Forte, M\u00e3o Amiga |url=http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093820/http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archivedate=2009-03-12 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The color of the plumes varies according to rank.

However dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century and, in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the [[Viceroy]] who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment \u2013 Vice-Roy Guard [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family.

The dragoons were the equivalent of the present-day [[Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces |Volunteer Forces]].\n\nIn modern Lithuania there is a dragoon battalion of the Grand Duke Butigeidis (''Lithuanian: did\u017eiojo kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Butigeid\u017eio drag\u016bn\u0173 batalionas'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kariuomene.kam.lt/lt/kariuomenes_struktura/kontaktai_1614/402.html|title=Lietuvos kariuomen\u0117 :: Kariuomen\u0117s strukt\u016bra \u00bb Kontaktai \u00bb Lietuvos did\u017eiojo kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Butigeid\u017eio drag\u016bn\u0173 batalionas|first=Fresh|last=Media|website=kariuomene.kam.lt}}</ref>\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn the [[Norwegian Army]] during the early part of the 20th century, dragoons served in part as mounted troops, and in part on skis or bicycles (''hjulryttere'', meaning \"wheel-riders\"). Dragoons fought on horses, bicycles and skis against the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion in 1940]]. After [[World War II]] the dragoon regiments were reorganized as [[armour]]ed [[reconnaissance]] units. \"Dragon\" is the rank of a compulsory service private cavalryman while enlisted (regular) cavalrymen have the same rank as infantrymen: \"Grenader\".\n\n=== Peru ===\n[[File:Dragones del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>Changing of the dragoon guard by the Field Marshal Nieto Regiment of Cavalry, Life-Guard of the President of the Republic of Peru </center>]]\nThe [[Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment|Presidential Escort Life Guard Dragoons Regiment \"Field Marshal Domingo Nieto\"]],  named after Field Marshal [[Domingo Nieto]], of the [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of the Republic of Per\u00fa]] were the traditional Guard of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] until March 5, 1987 and its disbandment in that year. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of February 2, 2012 the restoration of the Cavalry Regiment \"Marshal Domingo Nieto\" as the official escort of the President of the Republic of Peru was announced. The main mission of the reestablished regiment was to guarantee the security of the President of the Republic and of the Government Palace.\n\nThis regiment of dragoons was created in 1904 following the suggestion of a French military mission which undertook the reorganization of the [[Peruvian Army]] in 1896. The initial title of the unit was Cavalry Squadron \"President's Escort\". It was modelled on the French dragoons of the period. The unit was later renamed as the Cavalry Regiment \"President's Escort\" before receiving its current title in 1949.\n\nThe Peruvian Dragoon Guard has throughout its existence worn French-style uniforms of black tunic and red breeches in winter and white coat and red breeches in summer, with red and white plumed bronze helmets with the [[coat of arms of Peru]] and golden or red [[epaulettes]] depending on rank. They retain their original armament of [[lance]]s and [[sabre]]s, until the 1980s [[rifle]]s were used for dismounted drill.\n\nAt [[24-hour clock|13:00 hours]] every day, the main esplanade in front of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] fronting Lima's Main Square serves as the stage for the changing of the guard, undertaken by members of the Presidential Life Guard Escort Dragoons, mounted or dismounted. While the dismounted changing is held on Mondays and Fridays, the mounted ceremony is held twice a month on a Sunday.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe [[Portuguese Army]] still maintains two units which are descended from former regiments of dragoons. These are the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]] Dragoons\") and the 6th Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Chaves (Portugal)|Chaves]] Dragoons\"). Both regiments are, presently, armoured units. The [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade]]' Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 a unit from the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry \u2013 is known as the \"Paratroopers Dragoons\".\n\nDuring the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to combat the guerrillas in eastern [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]]. This unit was soon augmented, becoming a group of three squadrons, known as the \"[[Angola Dragoons]]\". The Angola Dragoons operated as mounted infantry \u2013 like the original dragoons \u2013 each soldier being armed with a [[pistol]] to fire when on horseback and with an [[automatic rifle]], to use when dismounted. A unit of the same type was being created in [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] when the war ended in 1974.\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Spanish Army]] began the training of a dragoon corps in 1635 under the direction of Pedro de la Puente at [[Innsbruck]]. In 1640 the first dragoon \"[[tercio]]\" was created, equipped with [[arquebus]]es and [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s. The number of dragoon tercios was increased to nine by the end of the [[17th century|XVII century]]: three garrisoned in [[Spain]], another three in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and the remainder in Milan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://caminoarocroi.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/los-dragones-infanteria-a-caballo-o-caballeria-desmontada/|title=Los dragones: \u00bfinfanter\u00eda a caballo, o caballer\u00eda desmontada?|date=2012-07-10|work=Camino a Rocroi|access-date=2018-12-02|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\nThe ''tercio''s were converted into a [[Regiment|regimental system]], beginning in 1704. [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] created several additional dragoon regiments to perform the functions of a police corps in the [[New World]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guerrerosdelahistoria.com/dragones-de-cuera/|title=Dragones de Cuera: Oeste Espa\u00f1ol {{!}} GUERREROS|website=guerrerosdelahistoria.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref> Notable amongst those units were the leather-clad [[Soldado de cuera|''dragones de cuera'']].\n\nIn 1803 the dragoon regiments were renamed as \"''caballer\u00eda ligera''\" (light cavalry). By 1815 these units had been disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eborense.es/soldados1808_pg_dragones.html|title=Uniformidad de los dragones espa\u00f1oles en 1808|last=G\u00f3mez|first=Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rodr\u00edguez|website=www.eborense.es|language=es-es|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref>\n\nSpain recreated its dragoons in the late nineteenth century. In 1930, three Spanish dragoon regiments were still in existence.<ref>Richard Knotel, pages 408-409 \"Uniforms of the World\", {{ISBN|0-684-16304-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\n{{See also|Norrlands dragonregemente}}\n\nIn the [[Swedish Army]], dragoons comprise the [[Military Police]] and Military Police Rangers. They also form the Dragoons Battalion of the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The Dragoons Battalion have roots that go back as far as 1523, making it one of the world's oldest military units still in service and the only mounted unit still retained by the Swedish Army. Horses are used for ceremonial purposes only, most often when the dragoons take part in the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace in Stockholm. \"''Livdragon''\" is the rank of a private cavalryman.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n[[File:Dragon IMG 3508.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbine of a Swiss dragoon, with the strap system allowing a quick draw while mounted. On display at Morges military museum.]]\nIn the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]], mounted dragoons existed until the early 1970s, when they were converted into Armoured Grenadiers units. The \"''Dragoner''\" had to prove he was able to keep a horse at home before entering the army. At the end of basic training they had to buy a horse at a reduced price from the army and to take it home together with equipment, uniform and weapon. In the \"yearly repetition course\" the dragoons served with their horses, often riding from home to the meeting point.\n\nThe abolition of the dragoon units, believed to be the last non-ceremonial horse cavalry in Europe, was a contentious issue in Switzerland. On 5 December 1972 the Swiss ''[[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]]'' approved the measure by 91 votes, against 71 for retention.<ref>{{cite web |title=11214 BRG |access-date=2014-02-01 |url=http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/gesch/1972/d_gesch_19720214_620.htm |date=1972 |publisher=National Council of Switzerland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201233741/http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/gesch/1972/d_gesch_19720214_620.htm |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the present-day [[British Army]] regular army, four regiments are designated as dragoons: The [[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]], The [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] ,the [[Royal Dragoon Guards]], and the [[Light Dragoons]]. In the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], one of the five squadrons of the [[Royal Yeomanry]]\u2014the [[Westminster Dragoons]]\u2014 also has the title of dragoons.\n\n=== United States ===\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalion, [[48th Infantry Regiment (United States)|48th Infantry]] were mechanized infantry units assigned to the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] (3AD) in [[West Germany]] during the [[Cold War]].  The unit crest of the 48th Infantry designated the unit as Dragoons, purely a traditional designation.\n\nThe 1st Dragoons was reformed in the [[Vietnam War]] era as the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Squadron, 1st U.S. Cavalry]]. It served in the [[Iraq War]] and remains as the oldest cavalry unit, as well as the most decorated one, in the U.S. Army.  Today's modern 1\u20131 Cavalry is a scout/attack unit, equipped with [[MRAP]]s, [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M3A3 Bradley CFVs]], and [[Stryker]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/134457/planes_trains_and_ferries_11_cav_equipment_arrives_in_europe |title=1/1 CAV equipment arrives in Europe|publisher=army.mil}}</ref>\n\nAnother modern [[United States Army]] unit, informally known as the 2nd Dragoons, is the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry Regiment]]. This unit was originally organized as the Second Regiment of Dragoons in 1836 and was renamed the Second Cavalry Regiment in 1861, being redesignated as the [[2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] in 1948. The regiment is currently equipped with the [[Stryker]] family of wheeled fighting vehicles and was redesignated as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in 2006.  In 2011 the 2nd Dragoon regiment was redesignated as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment has the distinction of being the longest continuously serving regiment in the United States Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.dragoons.org/2005/12/10/regimental-designations-and-deployments/ |title=Regimental Designations and Deployments &#124; 2d Dragoons |publisher=History.dragoons.org |date= |access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref>\n\nThe 113th Army Band at [[Fort Knox]] is also officially nicknamed as \"The Dragoons.\" This derives from its formation as the Band, First Regiment of Dragoons on July 8, 1840.\n\nCompany D, [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]], is nicknamed the \"Dragoons\".
