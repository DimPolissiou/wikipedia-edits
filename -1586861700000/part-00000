Distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the sixth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). The film was directed by [[James Wan]], from a screenplay by [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] and [[Will Beall]] and stars [[Jason Momoa]] as Aquaman, with [[Amber Heard]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Ludi Lin]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] in supporting roles. In the film, Aquaman sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]], replacing his half-brother, [[Ocean Master|King Orm]], who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004 but did not gain traction until ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' was released in 2013. In August 2014, Beall and [[Kurt Johnstad]] were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay. The main cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. [[Principal photography]] began in Australia in May 2017, taking place at [[Village Roadshow Studios]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], with additional production teams in [[Canada]], [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]]. Filming concluded the following October. Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging from high-detail hair simulations to the creation of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animals and locations.\n\n''Aquaman'' premiered in London on November 26, 2018, and was released in the United States on December 21. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing DCEU film, the highest-grossing film based on a DC Comics character (surpassing 2012's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''), the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2018]], and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|20th<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved not the current. Please do NOT adjust!--> highest of all-time]] at the time. A sequel, ''Aquaman 2'', is set for release on December 16, 2022, and a spin-off, ''The Trench'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Maine]] [[lighthouse keeper]] Thomas Curry rescues [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Atlanna|Atlanna]], the queen of the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. They fall in love and have a son, [[Aquaman|Arthur]], who has the power to communicate with sea creatures. When Atlantean soldiers are sent to retrieve Atlanna, who fled her arranged marriage in Atlantis, she is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, entrusting her advisor, [[Nuidis Vulko]], to train Arthur. Becoming a skilled warrior, Arthur rejects Atlantis upon learning that Atlanna was executed for having a half-breed son.\n\nIn the present day, several months after [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]]'s [[Justice League (film)|invasion]],{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.}} Arthur confronts pirates hijacking a [[Russian Navy|Russian]] [[Akula-class submarine]]. Their leader, Jesse Kane, is killed in a failed attempt to kill Arthur and his son [[Black Manta|David]] vows revenge. Orm, King of Atlantis and Arthur's half-brother, attempts to convince [[Nereus (DC Comics)|King Nereus]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)#Xebel|Xebel]] to help unite Atlantis and attack the surface world for polluting the oceans. Nereus notes that if Orm unites all four kingdoms, he will receive the title of [[Ocean Master]], commander of the most powerful force on the planet. A Russian submarine attacks and is destroyed by Orm, convincing Nereus to join forces to defend the oceans.\n\nNereus\u2019 daughter [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], betrothed to Orm, refuses to aid them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help. He refuses, but Mera earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tsunami sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, who urges Arthur to find the Trident of [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], a magic artifact of Atlantis' first ruler, to reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men, and Arthur is captured.\n\nArthur is chained and presented to Orm, who blames him and the surface for Atlanna's death. He offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur before Mera rescues him. Arthur and Mera journey to the fallen Kingdom of the Deserters hidden under the [[Sahara]] desert, where the trident was forged, and unlock a holographic message that leads them to [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], where they retrieve the trident's coordinates.\n\nOrm meets David, revealing that the submarine that attacked was the one hijacked by David, hired by Orm to stage an attack from the surface to win Nereus\u2019 support. Orm gives David a prototype Atlantean battle suit to kill Arthur, imprisons Vulko, and coerces the Atlantean Kingdom of the Fishermen to pledge their allegiance to him by killing their king and forcing the Princess, who is next in line for the throne, to assembly her forces out of fear.\n\nAn armored David rechristens himself [[Black Manta]] and ambushes Arthur and Mera in Sicily, grievously injuring Arthur before he is thrown off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they seek the trident and encourages him to embrace his destiny as king. At their destination, Arthur and Mera fend off amphibious monsters of [[The Trench (comics)|the Trench]], and a wormhole transports them to an uncharted sea at the center of the Earth. They are reunited with Atlanna, who was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but escaped to the uncharted sea alive and well.\n\nArthur faces the Karathen, a mythical [[leviathan]] and keeper of the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proving his worth and reclaiming the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Orm and his allies lead an army against the crustacean forces of the Kingdom of the Brine to complete Orm's preparations. As Orm declares himself Ocean Master, Arthur, and Mera, with the assistance of Karathen and the Trench, lead an army of marine creatures against him. Orm's followers embrace Arthur as the true king upon learning he wields the trident. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but spares his life, and Orm accepts his fate after discovering Arthur has rescued their mother. Atlanna reunites with Thomas, while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], David is rescued by Dr. [[Stephen Shin]], a marine scientist and conspiracy theorist obsessed with Atlantis, and agrees to lead Shin there in exchange for help in his revenge on Arthur.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II & James Wan (42867543485).jpg|thumb|right|270px|Cast and director of ''Aquaman'' at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Jeff White served as the VFX supervisor for ILM. For the underwater sequences, the actors were shot dry-for-wet on special tuning fork rigs designed by the FX team, and later the bodies of the actors were replaced with digital doubles in post-production. For creating Atlantis, the team relied on the designs provided by the art department. ILM's environment team created over 200 buildings, including the signature jellyfish buildings, and laid over 7,000 buildings in districts covering almost 600 square miles for the action to travel through. The underwater ships were modeled off organic creatures and designed to move that way. For the entrance to Atlantis sequence, the team built over 150,000 ships to fill the traffic lanes leading into Atlantis. All the animals, including the Karathen, were built by ILM and animated using [[Key frame|keyframe]] animation.\n\nApproximately 700 shots in the film required high-detail hair simulations. ILM had to significantly improve their hair simulation software due to the unique aspects of hair flowing underwater. Normally, hair simulations use guide strands to define or influence the movement of groups of hair strands. This did not provide a satisfying look, so ultimately, ILM simulated strands individually, which required heavy computations. Additionally, Wan wanted to be able to direct the hair when the physically accurate simulation resulted in undesirable results. ILM delivered 670 shots.<ref name=\"McIlwain\">{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=AQUAMAN: Kelvin McIlwain \u2013 Overall VFX Supervisor|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-kelvin-mcilwain-overall-vfx-supervisor/|date=7 January 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref><ref name=\"artofvfx.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-jeff-white-vfx-supervisor-and-cedric-lo-animation-supervisor-industrial-light-magic/|title=AQUAMAN: Jeff White (VFX Supervisor) and Cedric Lo (Animation Supervisor) \u2013 Industrial Light & Magic|date=January 9, 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\n[[DNEG]] digitally de-aged Willem Dafoe for the scene where his character Nuidis Vulko trains the young Arthur.<ref name=\"artofvfx.com\" />\n\nJay Barton served as the VFX supervisor for Digital Domain. They worked on creating the Dead King's Island environment. For the sequence, the actors were shot in a pool of water against [[Chroma key|blue screen]] backgrounds, with Digital Domain adding CG extensions, waterfalls, mountains and dinosaurs in post production. Most of the waterfalls in the scene were created using [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], while some were created using practical elements of things such as pouring salt and glass beads. They also built an extensive library of shot FX elements. The dinosaurs were animated using keyframe animation. Digital Domain delivered 19-20 shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-jay-barton-vfx-supervisor-digital-domain/|title=AQUAMAN: Jay Barton \u2013 VFX Supervisor \u2013 Digital Domain|date=January 11, 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\nDavid Nelson and Craig Wentworth served as VFX supervisors for Method Studios. Method handled the Sicily fight sequence between Arthur, Mera and Black Manta; Arthur's encounter with the Karathen in the Well of the Souls; and his acquisition of Atlan's trident. For the Sicily fight sequence, the team built the main square of the Italian village and terracotta tiled roof set pieces that were backed with blue screen. A completely CG village was also created based on scans and documentation of the real village.<ref name=McIlwain/> For the Well of the Souls sequence, Momoa was filmed dry-for-wet and captured on set in rigs that simulated underwater movements, but they ultimately felt restrictive so artists replaced the majority of his performance with a digital body double and added the CG environment, Karathen and Arthur's free-flowing locks. A specially designed 700fps shot was used in the scene where the camera travels through Arthur's eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.methodstudios.com/en/features/aquaman/|title=Aquaman|website=www.methodstudios.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-josh-simmonds-craig-wentworth-vfx-supervisors-method-studios/ |title=Aquaman: Josh Simmonds & Craig Wentworth \u2013 VFX supervisors \u2013 Method Studios |work=Art of VFX |date=January 29, 2019 |accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Rodeo FX]] worked on two key sequences, with Sebastien Moreau as VFX Supervisor. For the aquarium that young Arthur visits near the beginning, Rodeo FX used simulations as well as algorithms for the fish behavior. They created hard and soft corals by developing a colonization growth system, along with procedural stem and tentacle generation tools. They also created the environments for the Atlantis ruins below the desert. Artists used a [[Lego]]-type approach to layer the environment with a large amount of sand, dust, and rocks, all of which would realistically give way to the characters\u2019 interactions. From there, they sculpted ruined buildings, bridges, towers, statues, and temples, which were textured and shaded to add depth to the ruined city.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=Aquaman VFX Breakdown|url=http://www.animationboss.net/aquaman-vfx/|date=3 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationboss.net/aquaman-vfx/|title=Aquaman VFX Breakdown|date=January 3, 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nScanline VFX delivered 450 shots. Bryan Hirota served as VFX supervisor. The main sequences produced by them were the lighthouse and its surrounding environment, the \u201cAquaman\u201d title card that follows the Boston aquarium, Aquaman pushing the submarine to the surface and rescuing the sailors inside, Orm's tidal wave that sweeps away Arthur and Tom, including the rescue and aftermath, Black Manta being paid by Orm for the submarine's delivery, and Arthur and Mera's visit to the Kingdom of the Trench. For the title card, the team relied on Rodeo's work on the aquarium sequence and simulated up to 60,000 fish. The tidal wave sequence was realized with a large-scale simulated wave, which was integrated with a combination of day-for-night footage, blue screen shots for the actors in truck interiors, a truck on a rotisserie rig, an interior cabin in a water tank, and VFX simulations for debris. For creating the lighthouse, a full-size house with the base of the lighthouse tower was constructed by the FX team. Additional house and dock sets were built on sound stages. A digital build-out was done to complete the lighthouse tower and extend the dock fully out into the sea. For the sequence where the camera pushes into a toy snow globe with a tiny lighthouse inside, a CG transition was created from the lighthouse's living room set to a fully CG winter coastline. For creating the Trench creatures, motion capture was done on set by stunt performers.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=AQUAMAN: Bryan Hirota \u2013 VFX Supervisor \u2013 Scanline VFX|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-bryan-hirota-vfx-supervisor-scanline-vfx/|date=8 January 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nIn March 2017, prior to filming, a first look at ''Aquaman'' was shown during [[ShoWest Convention|CinemaCon]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Momoa introducing a video of director James Wan displaying a concept art sizzle reel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Couch |first1=Aaron |title='Aquaman' Shows Off Imaginative Concept Art at CinemaCon |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aquaman-shows-imaginative-concept-art-at-cinemacon-989908 |accessdate=September 17, 2017 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919120251/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aquaman-shows-imaginative-concept-art-at-cinemacon-989908|archive-date=September 19, 2017|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> Later, on July 22, the film's footage made its debut at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] (SDCC) 2017 with a teaser presented by Momoa during the Warner Bros. panel; director Wan presented the footage, stating that \"in a lot of ways, this is an origin story,\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Limbachia |first1=Dixie |title='Aquaman' Movie: First Footage Debuts at Comic-Con |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/aquaman-teaser-jason-momoa-comic-con-video-1202501924/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917213959/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/aquaman-teaser-jason-momoa-comic-con-video-1202501924/|archive-date=September 17, 2017|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> In April 2018, another teaser, with new footage, was shown by Wan and Momoa at CinemaCon, joined by Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II on stage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title='Aquaman' Footage Debuts at CinemaCon; 'Wonder Woman 2' Details Revealed |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/aquaman-footage-cinemacon-wonder-woman-2-1202785916/ |accessdate=April 25, 2018 |work=Variety |date=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425022253/http://variety.com/2018/film/news/aquaman-footage-cinemacon-wonder-woman-2-1202785916/|archive-date=April 25, 2018|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> Wan teased the conflict between Arthur and [[Ocean Master]], stating that \"it's almost a very classic Shakespearean story about brother from another world vs. brother from another world.

Distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the sixth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). The film was directed by [[James Wan]], from a screenplay by [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] and [[Will Beall]] and stars [[Jason Momoa]] as Aquaman, with [[Amber Heard]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Ludi Lin]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] in supporting roles. In the film, Aquaman sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]], replacing his half-brother, [[Ocean Master|King Orm]], who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004 but did not gain traction until ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' was released in 2013. In August 2014, Beall and [[Kurt Johnstad]] were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay. The main cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. [[Principal photography]] began in Australia in May 2017, taking place at [[Village Roadshow Studios]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], with additional production teams in [[Canada]], [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]]. Filming concluded the following October. Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging from high-detail hair simulations to the creation of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animals and locations.\n\n''Aquaman'' premiered in London on November 26, 2018, and was released in the United States on December 21. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing DCEU film, the highest-grossing film based on a DC Comics character (surpassing 2012's ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''), the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2018]], and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|20th<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved not the current. Please do NOT adjust!--> highest of all-time]] at the time. A sequel, ''Aquaman 2'', is set for release on December 16, 2022, and a spin-off, ''The Trench'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Maine]] [[lighthouse keeper]] Thomas Curry rescues [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Atlanna|Atlanna]], the queen of the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. They fall in love and have a son, [[Aquaman|Arthur]], who has the power to communicate with sea creatures. When Atlantean soldiers are sent to retrieve Atlanna, who fled her arranged marriage in Atlantis, she is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, entrusting her advisor, [[Nuidis Vulko]], to train Arthur. Becoming a skilled warrior, Arthur rejects Atlantis upon learning that Atlanna was executed for having a half-breed son.\n\nIn the present day, several months after [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]]'s [[Justice League (film)|invasion]],{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.}} Arthur confronts pirates hijacking a [[Russian Navy|Russian]] [[Akula-class submarine]]. Their leader, Jesse Kane, is killed in a failed attempt to kill Arthur and his son [[Black Manta|David]] vows revenge. Orm, King of Atlantis and Arthur's half-brother, attempts to convince [[Nereus (DC Comics)|King Nereus]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)#Xebel|Xebel]] to help unite Atlantis and attack the surface world for polluting the oceans. Nereus notes that if Orm unites all four kingdoms, he will receive the title of [[Ocean Master]], commander of the most powerful force on the planet. A Russian submarine attacks and is destroyed by Orm, convincing Nereus to join forces to defend the oceans.\n\nNereus\u2019 daughter [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], betrothed to Orm, refuses to aid them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help. He refuses, but Mera earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tsunami sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, who urges Arthur to find the Trident of [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], a magic artifact of Atlantis' first ruler, to reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men, and Arthur is captured.\n\nArthur is chained and presented to Orm, who blames him and the surface for Atlanna's death. He offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur before Mera rescues him. Arthur and Mera journey to the fallen Kingdom of the Deserters hidden under the [[Sahara]] desert, where the trident was forged, and unlock a holographic message that leads them to [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], where they retrieve the trident's coordinates.\n\nOrm meets David, revealing that the submarine that attacked was the one hijacked by David, hired by Orm to stage an attack from the surface to win Nereus\u2019 support. Orm gives David a prototype Atlantean battle suit to kill Arthur, imprisons Vulko, and coerces the Atlantean Kingdom of the Fishermen to pledge their allegiance to him by killing their king and forcing the Princess, who is next in line for the throne, to assembly her forces out of fear.\n\nAn armored David rechristens himself [[Black Manta]] and ambushes Arthur and Mera in Sicily, grievously injuring Arthur before he is thrown off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they seek the trident and encourages him to embrace his destiny as king. At their destination, Arthur and Mera fend off amphibious monsters of [[The Trench (comics)|the Trench]], and a wormhole transports them to an uncharted sea at the center of the Earth. They are reunited with Atlanna, who was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but escaped to the uncharted sea alive and well.\n\nArthur faces the Karathen, a mythical [[leviathan]] and keeper of the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proving his worth and reclaiming the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Orm and his allies lead an army against the crustacean forces of the Kingdom of the Brine to complete Orm's preparations. As Orm declares himself Ocean Master, Arthur, and Mera, with the assistance of Karathen and the Trench, lead an army of marine creatures against him. Orm's followers embrace Arthur as the true king upon learning he wields the trident. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but spares his life, and Orm accepts his fate after discovering Arthur has rescued their mother. Atlanna reunites with Thomas, while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], David is rescued by Dr. [[Stephen Shin]], a marine scientist and conspiracy theorist obsessed with Atlantis, and agrees to lead Shin there in exchange for help in his revenge on Arthur.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II & James Wan (42867543485).jpg|thumb|right|270px|Cast and director of ''Aquaman'' at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Jeff White served as the VFX supervisor for ILM. For the underwater sequences, the actors were shot dry-for-wet on special tuning fork rigs designed by the FX team, and later the bodies of the actors were replaced with digital doubles in post-production. For creating Atlantis, the team relied on the designs provided by the art department. ILM's environment team created over 200 buildings, including the signature jellyfish buildings, and laid over 7,000 buildings in districts covering almost 600 square miles for the action to travel through. The underwater ships were modeled off organic creatures and designed to move that way. For the entrance to Atlantis sequence, the team built over 150,000 ships to fill the traffic lanes leading into Atlantis. All the animals, including the Karathen, were built by ILM and animated using [[Key frame|keyframe]] animation.\n\nApproximately 700 shots in the film required high-detail hair simulations. ILM had to significantly improve their hair simulation software due to the unique aspects of hair flowing underwater. Normally, hair simulations use guide strands to define or influence the movement of groups of hair strands. This did not provide a satisfying look, so ultimately, ILM simulated strands individually, which required heavy computations. Additionally, Wan wanted to be able to direct the hair when the physically accurate simulation resulted in undesirable results. ILM delivered 670 shots.<ref name=\"McIlwain\">{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=AQUAMAN: Kelvin McIlwain \u2013 Overall VFX Supervisor|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-kelvin-mcilwain-overall-vfx-supervisor/|date=7 January 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref><ref name=\"artofvfx.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-jeff-white-vfx-supervisor-and-cedric-lo-animation-supervisor-industrial-light-magic/|title=AQUAMAN: Jeff White (VFX Supervisor) and Cedric Lo (Animation Supervisor) \u2013 Industrial Light & Magic|date=January 9, 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\n[[DNEG]] digitally de-aged Willem Dafoe for the scene where his character Nuidis Vulko trains the young Arthur.<ref name=\"artofvfx.com\" />\n\nJay Barton served as the VFX supervisor for Digital Domain. They worked on creating the Dead King's Island environment. For the sequence, the actors were shot in a pool of water against [[Chroma key|blue screen]] backgrounds, with Digital Domain adding CG extensions, waterfalls, mountains and dinosaurs in post production. Most of the waterfalls in the scene were created using [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], while some were created using practical elements of things such as pouring salt and glass beads. They also built an extensive library of shot FX elements. The dinosaurs were animated using keyframe animation. Digital Domain delivered 19-20 shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-jay-barton-vfx-supervisor-digital-domain/|title=AQUAMAN: Jay Barton \u2013 VFX Supervisor \u2013 Digital Domain|date=January 11, 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\nDavid Nelson and Craig Wentworth served as VFX supervisors for Method Studios. Method handled the Sicily fight sequence between Arthur, Mera and Black Manta; Arthur's encounter with the Karathen in the Well of the Souls; and his acquisition of Atlan's trident. For the Sicily fight sequence, the team built the main square of the Italian village and terracotta tiled roof set pieces that were backed with blue screen. A completely CG village was also created based on scans and documentation of the real village.<ref name=McIlwain/> For the Well of the Souls sequence, Momoa was filmed dry-for-wet and captured on set in rigs that simulated underwater movements, but they ultimately felt restrictive so artists replaced the majority of his performance with a digital body double and added the CG environment, Karathen and Arthur's free-flowing locks. A specially designed 700fps shot was used in the scene where the camera travels through Arthur's eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.methodstudios.com/en/features/aquaman/|title=Aquaman|website=www.methodstudios.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-josh-simmonds-craig-wentworth-vfx-supervisors-method-studios/ |title=Aquaman: Josh Simmonds & Craig Wentworth \u2013 VFX supervisors \u2013 Method Studios |work=Art of VFX |date=January 29, 2019 |accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Rodeo FX]] worked on two key sequences, with Sebastien Moreau as VFX Supervisor. For the aquarium that young Arthur visits near the beginning, Rodeo FX used simulations as well as algorithms for the fish behavior. They created hard and soft corals by developing a colonization growth system, along with procedural stem and tentacle generation tools. They also created the environments for the Atlantis ruins below the desert. Artists used a [[Lego]]-type approach to layer the environment with a large amount of sand, dust, and rocks, all of which would realistically give way to the characters\u2019 interactions. From there, they sculpted ruined buildings, bridges, towers, statues, and temples, which were textured and shaded to add depth to the ruined city.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=Aquaman VFX Breakdown|url=http://www.animationboss.net/aquaman-vfx/|date=3 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationboss.net/aquaman-vfx/|title=Aquaman VFX Breakdown|date=January 3, 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nScanline VFX delivered 450 shots. Bryan Hirota served as VFX supervisor. The main sequences produced by them were the lighthouse and its surrounding environment, the \u201cAquaman\u201d title card that follows the Boston aquarium, Aquaman pushing the submarine to the surface and rescuing the sailors inside, Orm's tidal wave that sweeps away Arthur and Tom, including the rescue and aftermath, Black Manta being paid by Orm for the submarine's delivery, and Arthur and Mera's visit to the Kingdom of the Trench. For the title card, the team relied on Rodeo's work on the aquarium sequence and simulated up to 60,000 fish. The tidal wave sequence was realized with a large-scale simulated wave, which was integrated with a combination of day-for-night footage, blue screen shots for the actors in truck interiors, a truck on a rotisserie rig, an interior cabin in a water tank, and VFX simulations for debris. For creating the lighthouse, a full-size house with the base of the lighthouse tower was constructed by the FX team. Additional house and dock sets were built on sound stages. A digital build-out was done to complete the lighthouse tower and extend the dock fully out into the sea. For the sequence where the camera pushes into a toy snow globe with a tiny lighthouse inside, a CG transition was created from the lighthouse's living room set to a fully CG winter coastline. For creating the Trench creatures, motion capture was done on set by stunt performers.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-01-10|title=AQUAMAN: Bryan Hirota \u2013 VFX Supervisor \u2013 Scanline VFX|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/aquaman-bryan-hirota-vfx-supervisor-scanline-vfx/|date=8 January 2019|website=The Art of VFX}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nIn March 2017, prior to filming, a first look at ''Aquaman'' was shown during [[ShoWest Convention|CinemaCon]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Momoa introducing a video of director James Wan displaying a concept art sizzle reel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Couch |first1=Aaron |title='Aquaman' Shows Off Imaginative Concept Art at CinemaCon |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aquaman-shows-imaginative-concept-art-at-cinemacon-989908 |accessdate=September 17, 2017 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919120251/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aquaman-shows-imaginative-concept-art-at-cinemacon-989908|archive-date=September 19, 2017|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> Later, on July 22, the film's footage made its debut at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] (SDCC) 2017 with a teaser presented by Momoa during the Warner Bros. panel; director Wan presented the footage, stating that \"in a lot of ways, this is an origin story,\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Limbachia |first1=Dixie |title='Aquaman' Movie: First Footage Debuts at Comic-Con |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/aquaman-teaser-jason-momoa-comic-con-video-1202501924/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917213959/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/aquaman-teaser-jason-momoa-comic-con-video-1202501924/|archive-date=September 17, 2017|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> In April 2018, another teaser, with new footage, was shown by Wan and Momoa at CinemaCon, joined by Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II on stage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title='Aquaman' Footage Debuts at CinemaCon; 'Wonder Woman 2' Details Revealed |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/aquaman-footage-cinemacon-wonder-woman-2-1202785916/ |accessdate=April 25, 2018 |work=Variety |date=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425022253/http://variety.com/2018/film/news/aquaman-footage-cinemacon-wonder-woman-2-1202785916/|archive-date=April 25, 2018|url-status=live |df=}}</ref> Wan teased the conflict between Arthur and [[Ocean Master]], stating that \"it's almost a very classic Shakespearean story about brother from another world vs. brother from another world.

The school offers academic [[scholarships]], which aid students from lower income backgrounds to afford [[tuition]] and boarding  [[fees]]. It has been awarded the International School award by the [[British Council]].\n\nThe school curriculum is based on the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] format of education, and has teaching facilities from Kindergarten, 1 to 10 (ICSE) and 11 and 12 (ISC).\n\n==History==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}Founded in 1865, it is one of the oldest established [[boarding school]]s in [[Asia]].\n\nThe school was named after Bishop [[George Edward Lynch Cotton]], the son of an Army captain, who died leading his regiment in battle. He was a scholar of [[Westminster School]], and a graduate of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. In 1836 he was appointed Assistant Master at [[Rugby School|Rugby]] by Doctor [[Thomas Arnold]], one of the founders of the British public school system.\n\nIt was the proposal of Bishop Cotton to create schools in India that resulted in the founding of Bishop Cotton\u2019s on 19 April 1865. The institution was opened for both boys and girls in a bungalow named Westward Ho in High Grounds. In 1871, the management acquired 14 acres of land on St. Mark\u2019s Road and shifted the school, demarcating two areas, one for the boys school and the other for the girls, with a wall separating the two.\n\nIn 1911, the management acquired Stafford House and its surrounding eight and a half acres with access to both Residency Road and St. Mark\u2019s Road and shifted the school, giving Bishop Cotton Girls\u2019 School its own identity. In 1915, money was sanctioned to construct the administration block and the quad. More buildings were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s including the Chapel of the Holy Family.\n\nThe first Indian principal to take charge of the school was CA (Acca) Joseph in 1963.\n\nExtracurricular activities includes sport, debate, creative writing, dramatics, declamation, verse speaking and choir.\n\nIt is affiliated with [[Bishop Cotton Boys School]], which is situated across the street on St. Marks Road.\n\n==School motto==\nNec Dextrorsum - Nec Sinistrosum\n\n\"Neither to the right nor to the left\", the motto reflects the spirit of the school. It is taken from a Latin translation of a phrase in the Old Testament of the Bible. The new leader Joshua is commissioned by God to be a true follower of His law, 'neither to the left nor to the right'.\n\n==School shield==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}The crest of the shield is the family crest of Bishop Cotton of Calcutta. The crest is divided vertically - the right side (dexter) has the arms of the Bishop of Calcutta. The Bishop's mitre on top is green on a white background and the staff and open Bible are in the bottom half on a red background. The left side (sinister) has three skeins of cotton and a chevron (inverted v) on a blue background. This side represents the ancient house to which Bishop Cotton belongede. The crest thus symbolises the godliness, service and courage for which the school stands.\n\n==School song and founder's hymn==\nThe Bishop Cotton [[school song]] was penned by Rev. [[Herbert Pakenham-Walsh]], of the Brotherhood of St. Peter, Warden of the school from 1907 to 1913, later to become bishop. The words were set to music by N. M. Saunders, Esq.\nWith its refrain \"On, Straight, On\", it follows the spirit of the school motto, \"Nec Dextrorsum Nec Sinistrorsum\", [[Latin]] for \"Neither to the Right Nor to the Left\".  The tradition of singing the school song and the founder's [[hymn]] in the chapel or in assemblies held in the auditorium continues to this day.\n\n==Academics==\nThe school, administered along the lines of Junior, Middle and Senior School, works through three school terms, each ending with examinations. Students of Class X appear for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (ICSE) by the beginning of March. Students of Class XII take up the Indian School Certificate Examination (ISC). The ISC examination is an equivalent to the pre-university examination conducted by the state boards of education. For further details, see the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (the body that conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations) using their website, www.cisce.org.\n\nSubjects taught at the ICSE level include English, an Indian or foreign language, History, Civics and Geography, Environmental Education, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and a choice between Home Science, Computer Applications, Fine Arts and Physical Education. At the ISC level, the school has three main streams, the Science stream, the Commerce stream and the Arts stream. It is mandatory for both streams to take up English and Environmental Education.\n\nFor the Science stream, the subjects offered are English, Environmental Education, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics/Home Science and a choice between Economics, Biotechnology, Computer Science, Hindi, Kannada, Fine Arts, Biology and Environmental Science. For the Commerce stream, the subjects offered are Accountancy and Commerce and a choice between Business Studies, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Fine Arts, Environmental Science and Physical Education. For the Arts stream the subjects offered are English, Environmental Education and History along with choices among Literature in English, Second Language, Environmental Science, Physical Education, Economics, Computer Science, Fine Art, Mathematics, Home Science, Business Studies, Political Science and Psychology.\n\nThe school offers language options of Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Nepali, French and German.\n\n==Sports==\nOrganized games includes the inter-school games competitions.\n* Cottonian Shield - basketball\n* Cottonian Shield - hockey\n\n==Principals==\n\n* Miss F Elmes (1913\u20131934) was the first principal.

The school offers academic [[scholarships]], which aid students from lower income backgrounds to afford [[tuition]] and boarding  [[fees]]. It has been awarded the International School award by the [[British Council]].\n\nThe school curriculum is based on the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] format of education, and has teaching facilities from Kindergarten, 1 to 10 (ICSE) and 11 and 12 (ISC).\n\n==History==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}Founded in 1865, it is one of the oldest established [[boarding school]]s in [[Asia]].\n\nThe school was named after Bishop [[George Edward Lynch Cotton]], the son of an Army captain, who died leading his regiment in battle. He was a scholar of [[Westminster School]], and a graduate of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. In 1836 he was appointed Assistant Master at [[Rugby School|Rugby]] by Doctor [[Thomas Arnold]], one of the founders of the British public school system.\n\nIt was the proposal of Bishop Cotton to create schools in India that resulted in the founding of Bishop Cotton\u2019s on 19 April 1865. The institution was opened for both boys and girls in a bungalow named Westward Ho in High Grounds. In 1871, the management acquired 14 acres of land on St. Mark\u2019s Road and shifted the school, demarcating two areas, one for the boys school and the other for the girls, with a wall separating the two.\n\nIn 1911, the management acquired Stafford House and its surrounding eight and a half acres with access to both Residency Road and St. Mark\u2019s Road and shifted the school, giving Bishop Cotton Girls\u2019 School its own identity. In 1915, money was sanctioned to construct the administration block and the quad. More buildings were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s including the Chapel of the Holy Family.\n\nThe first Indian principal to take charge of the school was CA (Acca) Joseph in 1963.\n\nExtracurricular activities includes sport, debate, creative writing, dramatics, declamation, verse speaking and choir.\n\nIt is affiliated with [[Bishop Cotton Boys School]], which is situated across the street on St. Marks Road.\n\n==School motto==\nNec Dextrorsum - Nec Sinistrosum\n\n\"Neither to the right nor to the left\", the motto reflects the spirit of the school. It is taken from a Latin translation of a phrase in the Old Testament of the Bible. The new leader Joshua is commissioned by God to be a true follower of His law, 'neither to the left nor to the right'.\n\n==School shield==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}The crest of the shield is the family crest of Bishop Cotton of Calcutta. The crest is divided vertically - the right side (dexter) has the arms of the Bishop of Calcutta. The Bishop's mitre on top is green on a white background and the staff and open Bible are in the bottom half on a red background. The left side (sinister) has three skeins of cotton and a chevron (inverted v) on a blue background. This side represents the ancient house to which Bishop Cotton belongede. The crest thus symbolises the godliness, service and courage for which the school stands.\n\n==School song and founder's hymn==\nThe Bishop Cotton [[school song]] was penned by Rev. [[Herbert Pakenham-Walsh]], of the Brotherhood of St. Peter, Warden of the school from 1907 to 1913, later to become bishop. The words were set to music by N. M. Saunders, Esq.\nWith its refrain \"On, Straight, On\", it follows the spirit of the school motto, \"Nec Dextrorsum Nec Sinistrorsum\", [[Latin]] for \"Neither to the Right Nor to the Left\".  The tradition of singing the school song and the founder's [[hymn]] in the chapel or in assemblies held in the auditorium continues to this day.\n\n==Academics==\nThe school, administered along the lines of Junior, Middle and Senior School, works through three school terms, each ending with examinations. Students of Class X appear for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (ICSE) by the beginning of March. Students of Class XII take up the Indian School Certificate Examination (ISC). The ISC examination is an equivalent to the pre-university examination conducted by the state boards of education. For further details, see the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (the body that conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations) using their website, www.cisce.org.\n\nSubjects taught at the ICSE level include English, an Indian or foreign language, History, Civics and Geography, Environmental Education, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and a choice between Home Science, Computer Applications, Fine Arts and Physical Education. At the ISC level, the school has three main streams, the Science stream, the Commerce stream and the Arts stream. It is mandatory for both streams to take up English and Environmental Education.\n\nFor the Science stream, the subjects offered are English, Environmental Education, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics/Home Science and a choice between Economics, Biotechnology, Computer Science, Hindi, Kannada, Fine Arts, Biology and Environmental Science. For the Commerce stream, the subjects offered are Accountancy and Commerce and a choice between Business Studies, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Fine Arts, Environmental Science and Physical Education. For the Arts stream the subjects offered are English, Environmental Education and History along with choices among Literature in English, Second Language, Environmental Science, Physical Education, Economics, Computer Science, Fine Art, Mathematics, Home Science, Business Studies, Political Science and Psychology.\n\nThe school offers language options of Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Nepali, French and German.\n\n==Sports==\nOrganized games includes the inter-school games competitions.\n* Cottonian Shield - basketball\n* Cottonian Shield - hockey\n\n==Principals==\n\n* Miss F Elmes (1913\u20131934) was the first principal.

TWS is located on approximately 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) on [[State Highway 6 (Texas)|State Highway 6]] in [[College Station, Texas]]. There is a {{convert|2|mi|km|0|adj=on}} oval, and several road course configurations. The full oval configuration is closely related to that of Michigan and is often considered the latter's sister track, featuring steeper banking, at 22 degrees in the turns, 12 degrees at the start/finish liking ne, and only 2 degrees along the backstretch,<ref>{{cite web|title=1978 USAC Texas Grand Prix telecast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhPyTRYmaFs}}</ref> compared to Michigan's respective 18, 12, and 5 degrees. The last major race occurred at the track in 1981. The track was used by amateur racing clubs such as the [[SCCA]], [[National Auto Sport Association|NASA]], [[Porsche Club of America]], Corinthian Vintage Auto Racing, [[Central Motorcycle Roadracing Association|CMRA]], driving schools and car clubs, as well as hosting music concerts and the like. The speedway was also a race track location for the video game, [[Need for Speed: Pro Street]] cc\u2019daa was aaa amp aaa Aafu\n\n==History==\n\nTWS is an exact copy of Michigan International Speedway and was part of Larry LoPatin's American Raceways Inc. and operated a part of [[Riverside International Raceway]], [[Trenton Speedway]], and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Raceway]] and in 1971 ARI went bankrupt. <ref>https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/06/racing-rain/</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980's the track fell into a state of disrepair, and both [[NASCAR]] and the [[American Championship car racing|Indy cars]] chose to drop it from their respective schedules. It continued to operate in a limited role for amateur racing. In 1991 Ishin Speed Sport, Inc. purchased the facility and repaved and modestly refurbished it. It hosted races for [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]], but after 1993 the company withdrew. The facility did serve as a venue for amateur and [[Sports Car Club of America|club racing]], along with private testing. NASCAR teams have used the oval for testing (as it mimics [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]]), as a way of skirting the tight restrictions prohibiting testing on active tracks on the schedule.\n\nDuring a January 2009 test, [[Greg Biffle]] managed to reach a top speed of {{convert|218|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest speed ever achieved on this track by a stock car (amateur or professional). The average speed for the full lap was {{convert|195|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notebook: Biffle hits 218 mph in test at Texas World|url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/22/notebook.gbiffle.dearnhardtjr.tstewart.mkenseth/index.html|publisher=Nascar.com|accessdate=3 December 2010|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn February 23, 1993, [[Jeff Andretti]] set the (then) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19930224&id=_H0zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4TIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7379,6880282 unofficial closed-course speed record] for [[IndyCars]] of {{convert|234.5|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, the fastest speed ever recorded at Texas World Speedway, while testing for the 1993 [[Indianapolis 500]]. This marked his first time back in an IndyCar since the 1992 Indianapolis 500 when he lost a wheel and crashed head-on into the wall, smashing both his legs. Andretti's fast run came at the conclusion of two days of testing where he consistently posted laps in the 230&nbsp;mph range. Andretti's [[Buick]]-powered [[Lola Cars|Lola]] was prepared by [[Pagan Racing]] of Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nTexas World Speedway was also the site of the 1974 [[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic]] with [[Willie Nelson]] and his guests [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], and [[Kinky Friedman]] performing as well. It was also known for a fire that destroyed several cars including one owned by [[Robert Earl Keen]]. The cover of Robert's album, ''[[Picnic (album)|Picnic]]'', shows a picture of his car on fire at the picnic. On September 18, 2017 an article on [[Jalopnik]] was posted confirming the closure of Texas World Speedway which was being used as a dumping ground for vehicles flooded out by [[Hurricane Harvey]].<ref>http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/thousands-of-flooded-hurricane-cars-finally-killed-texa-1797834948</ref>\n\nThe entire 600 acre facility is currently leased to Copart Inc as a Catastrophe storage facility for vehicles damaged by [[Hurricane Harvey]]. The vehicles will be stored while the numerous contracted insurance providers process the vehicles for disposition via auction, where the mass majority will be sold with a certificate of destruction title, ''i.e.'' parts only from dismantling companies. \n\nAs of July 19, 2018, developers broke ground to begin construction of the [https://southernpointe.com/ Southern Pointe] master-planned community. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/New-Southern-Pointe-Community-taking-shape-near-College-Station-488662631.html|title=New Southern Pointe Community taking shape near College Station|last=Falls|first=Clay|website=www.kbtx.com|language=english|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> Southern Pointe is going to be 550 acres with 73 acres of green space and water retention systems.

The full oval configuration is closely related to that of Michigan and is often considered the latter's sister track, featuring steeper banking, at 22 degrees in the turns, 12 degrees at the start/finish line, and only 2 degrees along the backstretch,<ref>{{cite web|title=1978 USAC Texas Grand Prix telecast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhPyTRYmaFs}}</ref> compared to Michigan's respective 18, 12, and 5 degrees. The last major race occurred at the track in 1981. The track was used by amateur racing clubs such as the [[SCCA]], [[National Auto Sport Association|NASA]], [[Porsche Club of America]], Corinthian Vintage Auto Racing, [[Central Motorcycle Roadracing Association|CMRA]], driving schools and car clubs, as well as hosting music concerts and the like. The speedway was also a race track location for the video game, [[Need for Speed: Pro Street]].\n\n==History==\n\nTWS is an exact copy of Michigan International Speedway and was part of Larry LoPatin's American Raceways Inc. and operated a part of [[Riverside International Raceway]], [[Trenton Speedway]], and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Raceway]] and in 1971 ARI went bankrupt. <ref>https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/06/racing-rain/</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980's the track fell into a state of disrepair, and both [[NASCAR]] and the [[American Championship car racing|Indy cars]] chose to drop it from their respective schedules. It continued to operate in a limited role for amateur racing. In 1991 Ishin Speed Sport, Inc. purchased the facility and repaved and modestly refurbished it. It hosted races for [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]], but after 1993 the company withdrew. The facility did serve as a venue for amateur and [[Sports Car Club of America|club racing]], along with private testing. NASCAR teams have used the oval for testing (as it mimics [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]]), as a way of skirting the tight restrictions prohibiting testing on active tracks on the schedule.\n\nDuring a January 2009 test, [[Greg Biffle]] managed to reach a top speed of {{convert|218|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest speed ever achieved on this track by a stock car (amateur or professional). The average speed for the full lap was {{convert|195|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notebook: Biffle hits 218 mph in test at Texas World|url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/cup/01/22/notebook.gbiffle.dearnhardtjr.tstewart.mkenseth/index.html|publisher=Nascar.com|accessdate=3 December 2010|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn February 23, 1993, [[Jeff Andretti]] set the (then) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19930224&id=_H0zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4TIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7379,6880282 unofficial closed-course speed record] for [[IndyCars]] of {{convert|234.5|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, the fastest speed ever recorded at Texas World Speedway, while testing for the 1993 [[Indianapolis 500]]. This marked his first time back in an IndyCar since the 1992 Indianapolis 500 when he lost a wheel and crashed head-on into the wall, smashing both his legs. Andretti's fast run came at the conclusion of two days of testing where he consistently posted laps in the 230&nbsp;mph range. Andretti's [[Buick]]-powered [[Lola Cars|Lola]] was prepared by [[Pagan Racing]] of Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nTexas World Speedway was also the site of the 1974 [[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic]] with [[Willie Nelson]] and his guests [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], and [[Kinky Friedman]] performing as well. It was also known for a fire that destroyed several cars including one owned by [[Robert Earl Keen]]. The cover of Robert's album, ''[[Picnic (album)|Picnic]]'', shows a picture of his car on fire at the picnic. On September 18, 2017 an article on [[Jalopnik]] was posted confirming the closure of Texas World Speedway which was being used as a dumping ground for vehicles flooded out by [[Hurricane Harvey]].<ref>http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/thousands-of-flooded-hurricane-cars-finally-killed-texa-1797834948</ref>\n\nThe entire 600 acre facility is currently leased to Copart Inc as a Catastrophe storage facility for vehicles damaged by [[Hurricane Harvey]]. The vehicles will be stored while the numerous contracted insurance providers process the vehicles for disposition via auction, where the mass majority will be sold with a certificate of destruction title, ''i.e.'' parts only from dismantling companies. \n\nAs of July 19, 2018, developers broke ground to begin construction of the [https://southernpointe.com/ Southern Pointe] master-planned community. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/New-Southern-Pointe-Community-taking-shape-near-College-Station-488662631.html|title=New Southern Pointe Community taking shape near College Station|last=Falls|first=Clay|website=www.kbtx.com|language=english|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> Southern Pointe is going to be 550 acres with 73 acres of green space and water retention systems.

Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reprpoductionpoop at a distance. One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.<ref>\n\n[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/32448.html Erster elektromagnetischer Telegraph der Welt \u00fcber den D\u00e4chern von G\u00f6ttingen] (First electromagnetic telegraph in the world over the roofs of G\u00f6ttingen), Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen website.

He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect \"galvanic music\".<ref>[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/]{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n=== Innocenzo Manzetti ===\n\n[[Innocenzo Manzetti]] considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an [[automaton]] built by him in 1849.\n\n=== Charles Bourseul ===\n\n[[Charles Bourseul]] was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a \"make-and-break\" telephone in 1854. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy.\n\nBourseul explained: \"Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disc sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery: you may have at a distance another disc which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations.... It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, a speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result.\"\n\n=== Johann Philipp Reis ===\n\n[[File:DBP 1984 1198 Philipp Reis.jpg|thumb|right|A stamp dedicated to Johann Philipp Reis]]\n\nThe [[Reis telephone]] was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a \"telephone\", since it did transmit voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense.\n\nThomas Edison tested the Reis equipment and found that \"single words, uttered as in reading, speaking and the like, were perceptible indistinctly, notwithstanding here also the inflections of the voice, the modulations of interrogation, wonder, command, etc., attained distinct expression.\"<ref>Coe, page 23</ref>\n\nIn 1847, the Reis device was tested by the British company [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] (STC). The results also confirmed it could transmit and receive speech with good quality (fidelity), but relatively low intensity. At the time STC was bidding for a contract with Alexander Graham Bell's [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]], and the results were covered up by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's reputation.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Antonio Meucci ===\n\nAn early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by [[Antonio Meucci]], who called it a ''telettrofono''. In 1871 Meucci filed a [[patent caveat|caveat]] at the US Patent Office{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. His caveat describes his invention, but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone.\n\n[[File:Antonio Meucci.jpg|thumb|Antonio Meucci, c.1880]]\n\nThe first American demonstration of Meucci's invention took place in [[Staten Island]], New York in 1854{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. In 1861, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian-language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his [[Antonio Meucci#Caveat|1871 U.S. patent caveat]]. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path.\n\nIn the 1880s Meucci was credited with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long-distance signals{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in [[Havana, Cuba]], however, this may have been a variant of a [[Tin can telephone|string telephone]] that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-[[sidetone]] circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a feedback process.\n\nAn [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) laboratory reportedly lost some of Meucci's working models, his wife reportedly disposed of others and Meucci, who sometimes lived on public assistance, chose not to renew his 1871 ''teletrofono'' [[patent caveat]] after 1874{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\nA resolution was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2002 that said Meucci did pioneering work on the development of the telephone.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.RES.269: House Resolution 269]</ref><ref>Wheen, Andrew.

Others in Canada disagreed with the Congressional resolution, some of whom provided criticisms of both its accuracy and intent.\n\n==== Chronology of Meucci's invention ====\n\nA retired director general of the [[Telecom Italia]] central telecommunications research institute ([[CSELT]]), Basilio Catania,<ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/ Basilio Catania Homepage]</ref> and the Italian Society of Electrotechnics, \"Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica\", have devoted a Museum to Antonio Meucci, constructing a chronology of his invention of the telephone and tracing the history of the two legal trials involving Meucci and Alexander Graham Bell.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusione]</ref><ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci.htm Meucci], ChezBasilio.org website</ref><ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm aei.it website]</ref>\n\nThey claim that Meucci was the actual inventor of the telephone, and base their argument on reconstructed evidence. What follows, if not otherwise stated, is a summary of their historic reconstruction.<ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/immagini/meucci-bell.pdf Basilio Catania's reconstruction, in English]</ref>\n* In 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"Teatro della Pergola\" in Florence. This telephone is constructed on the model of pipe-telephones on ships and is still working.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_tela.htm Picture of the acoustic telephone, page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]</ref>\n* In 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire was vibrating just like a leaf of an electroscope; which means that there was an electrostatic effect. In order to continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he heard inarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (litt. \"talking telegraph\").<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_voce.htm Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]</ref>\n* On the basis of this prototype, Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of sound transmitting devices inspired by the telegraph model as did other pioneers of the telephone, such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] and others. Meucci later claimed that he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph \"make-and-break\" method, but he looked for a \"continuous\" solution that did not interrupt the electric current.\n* Meucci later claimed that he constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and keeping a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was hosted in a cylindrical carton box.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_t1em.htm Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042803/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_t1em.htm |date=July 28, 2010 }}</ref> He said he constructed this as a way to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his wife who was an [[Patient|invalid]].\n* Meucci separated the two directions of transmission in order to eliminate the so-called \"local effect\", adopting what we would call today a 4-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator which short-circuited the instrument of the calling person, producing in the instrument of the called person a succession of impulses (clicks), much more intense than those of normal conversation. As he was aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). He successfully used an insulated copper plait, thus anticipating the [[litz wire]] used by [[Nikola Tesla]] in RF coils.\n* In 1864 Meucci later claimed that he realized his \"best device\", using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm.\n* In August 1870, Meucci later claimed that he obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper plait insulated by cotton. He called his device \"teletrofono\".

In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies \u2013 that is to say, more than one musical tone \u2013 can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for \"Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones\" (the harmonic)\n\nOn February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed a [[patent caveat]] for a telephone on the very same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The [[water microphone|water transmitter]] described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental telephone transmitter tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.<ref>[[Inventors Digest]], July/August 1998, p. 26-28</ref>\n\n=== Alexander Graham Bell ===\n\n[[File:AGBell Notebook.jpg|thumb|right|Bell's March 11 1876, laboratory notebook entry describing his first successful experiment with the telephone]]\n<!-- irrelevant biographical information removed. I put it here for public reference:\nHe was a British (Scottish-born), Canadian, and naturalized American in 1882, scientist and inventor; he is most famous for his pioneering work on the development of the telephone, and obtaining key patents. Alexander Graham Bell was born on 3 March 1847 in Edinburgh and educated there and in London. His father and grandfather were both authorities on elocution and at the age of 16 Bell himself began researching the mechanics of speech. In 1870, Bell emigrated with his family to Canada, and the following year he moved to the United States to teach. He became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1882. Bell died on August 2, 1922. at his home in Nova Scotia. In 1888, Bell was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society, and served as its president from 1896 to 1904, also helping to establish its journal.-->\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] had pioneered a system called visible speech, developed by his father, to teach deaf children. In 1872 Bell founded a school in Boston to train teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently became part of Boston University, where Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873.\n\nAs Professor of Vocal Physiology at [[Boston University]], Bell was engaged in training teachers in the art of instructing the deaf how to speak and experimented with the [[Leon Scott]] [[phonautograph]] in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of [[smoked glass]]. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 102\u2013103, 110\u2013113, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nThis background prepared Bell for work with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873\u20131874 with a harmonic telegraph, following the examples of Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 104\u2013109</ref>\n\nDuring a June 2, 1875, experiment by Bell and his assistant [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]], a receiver reed failed to respond to the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the other end of the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 146\u2013148</ref> A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.\n\nAfter Bell and Watson discovered on June 2, 1875, that movements of the reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of [[goldbeater's skin]] with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter.<ref name=\"Robert Bruce 1990, page 149\">Robert Bruce (1990), page 149</ref> This was the \"gallows\" phone. A few days later they were tried together, one at each end of the line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puleo |first=Stephen |date=2011 |title=A City So Grand: The Rise of an American Metropolis, Boston 1850-1900 |isbn=978-0807001493 |publisher=Beacon Press |pages=195}}</ref> Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other.

Because of illness and other commitments, Bell made little or no telephone improvements or experiments for eight months until after his U.S. patent 174,465 was published.<ref name=\"Robert Bruce 1990, page 149\"/>, but within a year the first telephone exchange was built in Connecticut and the Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, with Bell the owner of a third of the shares, quickly making him a wealthy man.\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent, 174465, granted to Bell, March 7, 1876]]\n\nIn 1880, Bell was awarded the French [[Volta Prize]] for his invention and with the money, founded the Volta Laboratory in Washington, where he continued experiments in communication, in medical research, and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf, working with Helen Keller among others. In 1885 he acquired land in Nova Scotia and established a summer home there where he continued experiments, particularly in the field of aviation.\n\nBell himself claimed that the telephone was invented in Canada but made in the United States.<ref>https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innovations/023020-3020-e.html</ref>\n\n=== Bell's success ===\n[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent<ref>{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: \"Improvement in Telegraphy\" filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}</ref> drawing, March 7, 1876]]\n[[File:Telephone Centennial Issue 1976-13c.jpg|thumb|right\\240px|Bell's Prototype [[History of the telephone|Telephone]] Centennial Issue of 1976]]\n\nThe first successful bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson was made on March 10, 1876, when Bell spoke into the device, \"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\" and Watson complied with the request. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design<ref>Shulman, pages 36-37. Bell's lab notes dated March 9, 1876 show a drawing of a person speaking face down into a liquid transmitter very similar to the liquid transmitter depicted as Fig. 3 in Gray's caveat.</ref> in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment<ref>Evenson, page 99.</ref> to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \"articulate speech\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.<ref>Evenson, page 98.</ref> Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.<ref>Evenson, page 100.</ref>\n\nBell's telephone transmitter (microphone) consisted of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron \"armature\" induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.\n\nThis primitive telephone was rapidly improved. The double electromagnet was replaced by a single permanently magnetized [[magnet|bar magnet]] having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the [[magnetic field]] of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.\n\nIn the third of his tests in Southern Ontario, on August 10, 1876, Bell made a call via the telegraph line from the family homestead in [[Brantford, Ontario]], to his assistant located in [[Paris, Ontario]], some 13 kilometers miles away. This test was claimed by many sources as the world's first long-distance call.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telecommunications.ca/alexander-graham-bell-invention-telephone.htm |title=Alexander Graham Bell 1847-1922 Inventor of the Bell System |publisher=Telecommunications Canada |access-date=January 14, 2020 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1187 |title=Invention of the Telephone National Historic Event |publisher=Parks Canada |access-date=January 14, 2020 |quote=Bell made public demonstrations of his now patented invention, culminating in the world's first long distance call, to Paris, 13 kilometres away, on 10 August}}</ref> The final test certainly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.\n\n==== Public demonstrations ====\n\n===== Early public demonstrations of Bell's telephone =====\n{{Further information|Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success}}\n\n<!-- After demonstrating his invention to small groups of academics [preceding text pending confirmation -->Bell exhibited a working telephone at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]] in June 1876, where it attracted the attention of Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] plus the [[physicist]] and engineer [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 at a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, \"I heard [through the telephone] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S.

Although not the first to experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the telephone industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].<ref>\n\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:First_Intelligible_Voice_Transmission_over_Electric_Wire,_1876\n |title=Milestones:First Intelligible Voice Transmission over Electric Wire, 1876\n |date=\n |work=IEEE Global History Network\n |publisher=IEEE\n |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Variable resistance transmitters ==\n\n=== Water microphone \u2013 Elisha Gray ===\n\n[[Elisha Gray]] recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the [[Tin can telephone|lover's telegraph]], that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a [[patent caveat]] with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a [[water microphone|liquid microphone]]. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed \u2013 just barely \u2013 into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.\n\nWhen Gray applied for a patent for the variable resistance telephone transmitter, the [[United States Patent Office|Patent Office]] determined \"while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the ([[Liquid rheostat|variable resistance]]) invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered.\"<ref>Burton Baker, pages 90\u201391</ref>\n\n=== Carbon microphone \u2013 Thomas Edison, Edward Hughes, Emile Berliner ===\nThe carbon microphone was independently developed around 1878 by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.\n\n[[Thomas Alva Edison]] took the next step in improving the telephone with his invention in 1878 of the [[Carbon microphone|carbon grain \"transmitter\"]] (microphone) that provided a strong voice signal on the transmitting circuit that made long-distance calls practical. Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable [[electrical resistance]] that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters.\n\nThe carbon microphone was further improved by [[Emile Berliner]], [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake]], [[David E. Hughes]], [[Henry Hunnings]], and [[Anthony C. White|Anthony White]]. The carbon microphone remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, and is still being produced.\n\n== Improvements to the early telephone ==\n\nAdditional inventions such as the [[Ringing (telephony)|call bell]], [[telephone exchange|central telephone exchange]], [[common battery]], [[ringtone|ring tone]], [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[trunking|trunk lines]], and wireless phones \u2013 at first [[cordless telephone|cordless]] and then fully [[mobile phone|mobile]] \u2013 made the telephone the useful and widespread apparatus as it is now.\n\n\n=== Telephone exchanges ===\n\nThe telephone exchange was an idea of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] engineer [[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] (1844\u20131893) in 1876, while he was working for [[Thomas Edison]] on a telegraph exchange.<ref>\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204071321/http://hungarian-history.hu/mszh/epuskas.htm Pusk\u00e1s Tivadar (1844\u20131893)] (short biography), Hungarian History website.

This caused Pusk\u00e1s to take a fresh look at his own work and he refocused on perfecting a design for a [[telephone exchange]]. He then got in touch with the U.S. inventor [[Thomas Edison]] who liked the design. According to Edison, \"Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange\".<ref>Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin.

Retrieved from Gutenberg.org.</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n{{Further information|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}\n{{See also|Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell}}\n\nBell has been widely recognized as the \"inventor\" of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter was for a long time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci ''\"<u>in</u> the invention of the telephone\"'' (not ''\"<u>for</u> the invention of the telephone\"''), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of the telephone to Bell.\n\nChampions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nOne of the valuable claims in Bell's 1876 {{US patent|174465}} was claim 4, a method of producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's [[patent drawing]]s, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his [[Patent caveat|caveat]] filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the variable resistance feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the variable resistance feature before January 18, 1876, \"almost at the last moment\" before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by Evenson<ref>Evenson, pp 64\u201369, 86\u201387, 110, 194\u2013196</ref> argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876.\n\nContrary to the popular story, Gray's caveat was taken to the US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and remained near the bottom of the in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier.<ref>Evenson, pages 68\u201369</ref> Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.\n\n== Memorial to the invention ==\n{{Main|Bell Telephone Memorial}}\n\nIn 1906 the citizens of the City of [[Brantford|Brantford, Ontario]], Canada and [[County of Brant|its surrounding area]] formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in July 1874 at his parents\u2019 home, Melville House, near Brantford.<ref name=\"Whitaker\">\n\nWhitaker, A.J.

Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.<ref>\n\n[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/32448.html Erster elektromagnetischer Telegraph der Welt \u00fcber den D\u00e4chern von G\u00f6ttingen] (First electromagnetic telegraph in the world over the roofs of G\u00f6ttingen), Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen website.

He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect \"galvanic music\".<ref>[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/]{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n=== Innocenzo Manzetti ===\n\n[[Innocenzo Manzetti]] considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an [[automaton]] built by him in 1849.\n\n=== Charles Bourseul ===\n\n[[Charles Bourseul]] was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a \"make-and-break\" telephone in 1854. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy.\n\nBourseul explained: \"Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disc sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery: you may have at a distance another disc which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations.... It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, a speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result.\"\n\n=== Johann Philipp Reis ===\n\n[[File:DBP 1984 1198 Philipp Reis.jpg|thumb|right|A stamp dedicated to Johann Philipp Reis]]\n\nThe [[Reis telephone]] was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a \"telephone\", since it did transmit voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense.\n\nThomas Edison tested the Reis equipment and found that \"single words, uttered as in reading, speaking and the like, were perceptible indistinctly, notwithstanding here also the inflections of the voice, the modulations of interrogation, wonder, command, etc., attained distinct expression.\"<ref>Coe, page 23</ref>\n\nIn 1847, the Reis device was tested by the British company [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] (STC). The results also confirmed it could transmit and receive speech with good quality (fidelity), but relatively low intensity. At the time STC was bidding for a contract with Alexander Graham Bell's [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]], and the results were covered up by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's reputation.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Antonio Meucci ===\n\nAn early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by [[Antonio Meucci]], who called it a ''telettrofono''. In 1871 Meucci filed a [[patent caveat|caveat]] at the US Patent Office{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. His caveat describes his invention, but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone.\n\n[[File:Antonio Meucci.jpg|thumb|Antonio Meucci, c.1880]]\n\nThe first American demonstration of Meucci's invention took place in [[Staten Island]], New York in 1854{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. In 1861, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian-language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his [[Antonio Meucci#Caveat|1871 U.S. patent caveat]]. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path.\n\nIn the 1880s Meucci was credited with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long-distance signals{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in [[Havana, Cuba]], however, this may have been a variant of a [[Tin can telephone|string telephone]] that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-[[sidetone]] circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a feedback process.\n\nAn [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) laboratory reportedly lost some of Meucci's working models, his wife reportedly disposed of others and Meucci, who sometimes lived on public assistance, chose not to renew his 1871 ''teletrofono'' [[patent caveat]] after 1874{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\nA resolution was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2002 that said Meucci did pioneering work on the development of the telephone.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.RES.269: House Resolution 269]</ref><ref>Wheen, Andrew.

Others in Canada disagreed with the Congressional resolution, some of whom provided criticisms of both its accuracy and intent.\n\n==== Chronology of Meucci's invention ====\n\nA retired director general of the [[Telecom Italia]] central telecommunications research institute ([[CSELT]]), Basilio Catania,<ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/ Basilio Catania Homepage]</ref> and the Italian Society of Electrotechnics, \"Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica\", have devoted a Museum to Antonio Meucci, constructing a chronology of his invention of the telephone and tracing the history of the two legal trials involving Meucci and Alexander Graham Bell.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusione]</ref><ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci.htm Meucci], ChezBasilio.org website</ref><ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm aei.it website]</ref>\n\nThey claim that Meucci was the actual inventor of the telephone, and base their argument on reconstructed evidence. What follows, if not otherwise stated, is a summary of their historic reconstruction.<ref>[http://www.chezbasilio.org/immagini/meucci-bell.pdf Basilio Catania's reconstruction, in English]</ref>\n* In 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \"Teatro della Pergola\" in Florence. This telephone is constructed on the model of pipe-telephones on ships and is still working.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_tela.htm Picture of the acoustic telephone, page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]</ref>\n* In 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \"tongue\" of copper wire was vibrating just like a leaf of an electroscope; which means that there was an electrostatic effect. In order to continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he heard inarticulated human voice. He called this device \"telegrafo parlante\" (litt. \"talking telegraph\").<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_voce.htm Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]</ref>\n* On the basis of this prototype, Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of sound transmitting devices inspired by the telegraph model as did other pioneers of the telephone, such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] and others. Meucci later claimed that he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph \"make-and-break\" method, but he looked for a \"continuous\" solution that did not interrupt the electric current.\n* Meucci later claimed that he constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and keeping a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was hosted in a cylindrical carton box.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_t1em.htm Meucci's original drawings.

He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator which short-circuited the instrument of the calling person, producing in the instrument of the called person a succession of impulses (clicks), much more intense than those of normal conversation. As he was aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \"skin effect\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). He successfully used an insulated copper plait, thus anticipating the [[litz wire]] used by [[Nikola Tesla]] in RF coils.\n* In 1864 Meucci later claimed that he realized his \"best device\", using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm.\n* In August 1870, Meucci later claimed that he obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper plait insulated by cotton. He called his device \"teletrofono\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci dated September 27, 1870, show coils of wire on long-distance telephone lines.<ref>[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_cain.htm Affidavit of lawyer Michael Lemmi]</ref> The painting made by Nestore Corradi [[:it:Nestore Corradi]] in 1858 mentions the sentence \"Electric current from the inductor pipe\"\n\nThe above information was published in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' Supplement No. 520 of December 19, 1876,<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/3/4/0/13401/13401-h/13401-h.htm#13 Scientific American Supplement No. 520, December 19, 1885]</ref> based on reconstructions produced in 1885, for which there was no contemporary pre-1875 evidence.

In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies \u2013 that is to say, more than one musical tone \u2013 can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for \"Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones\" (the harmonic)\n\nOn February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed a [[patent caveat]] for a telephone on the very same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The [[water microphone|water transmitter]] described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental telephone transmitter tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.<ref>[[Inventors Digest]], July/August 1998, p. 26-28</ref>\n\n=== Alexander Graham Bell ===\n\n[[File:AGBell Notebook.jpg|thumb|right|Bell's March 11 1876, laboratory notebook entry describing his first successful experiment with the telephone]]\n<!-- irrelevant biographical information removed. I put it here for public reference:\nHe was a British (Scottish-born), Canadian, and naturalized American in 1882, scientist and inventor; he is most famous for his pioneering work on the development of the telephone, and obtaining key patents. Alexander Graham Bell was born on 3 March 1847 in Edinburgh and educated there and in London. His father and grandfather were both authorities on elocution and at the age of 16 Bell himself began researching the mechanics of speech. In 1870, Bell emigrated with his family to Canada, and the following year he moved to the United States to teach. He became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1882. Bell died on August 2, 1922. at his home in Nova Scotia. In 1888, Bell was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society, and served as its president from 1896 to 1904, also helping to establish its journal.-->\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] had pioneered a system called visible speech, developed by his father, to teach deaf children. In 1872 Bell founded a school in Boston to train teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently became part of Boston University, where Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873.\n\nAs Professor of Vocal Physiology at [[Boston University]], Bell was engaged in training teachers in the art of instructing the deaf how to speak and experimented with the [[Leon Scott]] [[phonautograph]] in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of [[smoked glass]]. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 102\u2013103, 110\u2013113, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nThis background prepared Bell for work with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873\u20131874 with a harmonic telegraph, following the examples of Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 104\u2013109</ref>\n\nDuring a June 2, 1875, experiment by Bell and his assistant [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]], a receiver reed failed to respond to the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the other end of the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate.<ref>Robert Bruce (1990), pages 146\u2013148</ref> A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.\n\nAfter Bell and Watson discovered on June 2, 1875, that movements of the reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of [[goldbeater's skin]] with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter.<ref name=\"Robert Bruce 1990, page 149\">Robert Bruce (1990), page 149</ref> This was the \"gallows\" phone. A few days later they were tried together, one at each end of the line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puleo |first=Stephen |date=2011 |title=A City So Grand: The Rise of an American Metropolis, Boston 1850-1900 |isbn=978-0807001493 |publisher=Beacon Press |pages=195}}</ref> Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, \"Do you understand what I say?\" and Watson answered \"Yes\". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.\n\nIn a March 10, 1876, test, between two rooms in a single building in Boston<ref>{{cite book |last=Evenson |first=A Edward |date=November 10, 2000 |title=The Telephone Patent Conspiracy of 1876: The Elisha Gray-Alexander Bell Controversy and Its Many Players |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KiJJ7Bp-xtcC&pg=PA99&dq=Mr.+Watson+%E2%80%94+Come+here+%E2%80%94+I+want+to+see+you#v=onepage |location= |publisher=McFarland |page=99 |isbn=0786408839}}</ref> showed that the telephone worked, but so far, only at a short range.<ref>American Treasures of the Library of Congress ...

Because of illness and other commitments, Bell made little or no telephone improvements or experiments for eight months until after his U.S. patent 174,465 was published.<ref name=\"Robert Bruce 1990, page 149\"/>, but within a year the first telephone exchange was built in Connecticut and the Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, with Bell the owner of a third of the shares, quickly making him a wealthy man.\n[[File:USPTO Telephone Patent No. 174465.jpg|thumb|The master telephone patent, 174465, granted to Bell, March 7, 1876]]\n\nIn 1880, Bell was awarded the French [[Volta Prize]] for his invention and with the money, founded the Volta Laboratory in Washington, where he continued experiments in communication, in medical research, and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf, working with Helen Keller among others. In 1885 he acquired land in Nova Scotia and established a summer home there where he continued experiments, particularly in the field of aviation.\n\nBell himself claimed that the telephone was invented in Canada but made in the United States.<ref>https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innovations/023020-3020-e.html</ref>\n\n=== Bell's success ===\n[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent<ref>{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: \"Improvement in Telegraphy\" filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}</ref> drawing, March 7, 1876]]\n[[File:Telephone Centennial Issue 1976-13c.jpg|thumb|right\\240px|Bell's Prototype [[History of the telephone|Telephone]] Centennial Issue of 1976]]\n\nThe first successful bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson was made on March 10, 1876, when Bell spoke into the device, \"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\" and Watson complied with the request. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design<ref>Shulman, pages 36-37. Bell's lab notes dated March 9, 1876 show a drawing of a person speaking face down into a liquid transmitter very similar to the liquid transmitter depicted as Fig. 3 in Gray's caveat.</ref> in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment<ref>Evenson, page 99.</ref> to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \"articulate speech\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.<ref>Evenson, page 98.</ref> Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.<ref>Evenson, page 100.</ref>\n\nBell's telephone transmitter (microphone) consisted of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron \"armature\" induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.\n\nThis primitive telephone was rapidly improved. The double electromagnet was replaced by a single permanently magnetized [[magnet|bar magnet]] having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the [[magnetic field]] of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.\n\nIn the third of his tests in Southern Ontario, on August 10, 1876, Bell made a call via the telegraph line from the family homestead in [[Brantford, Ontario]], to his assistant located in [[Paris, Ontario]], some 13 kilometers miles away. This test was claimed by many sources as the world's first long-distance call.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telecommunications.ca/alexander-graham-bell-invention-telephone.htm |title=Alexander Graham Bell 1847-1922 Inventor of the Bell System |publisher=Telecommunications Canada |access-date=January 14, 2020 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1187 |title=Invention of the Telephone National Historic Event |publisher=Parks Canada |access-date=January 14, 2020 |quote=Bell made public demonstrations of his now patented invention, culminating in the world's first long distance call, to Paris, 13 kilometres away, on 10 August}}</ref> The final test certainly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.\n\n==== Public demonstrations ====\n\n===== Early public demonstrations of Bell's telephone =====\n{{Further information|Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success}}\n\n<!-- After demonstrating his invention to small groups of academics [preceding text pending confirmation -->Bell exhibited a working telephone at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]] in June 1876, where it attracted the attention of Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] plus the [[physicist]] and engineer [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 at a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, \"I heard [through the telephone] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S.

Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!'

Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard.

Although not the first to experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the telephone industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].<ref>\n\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:First_Intelligible_Voice_Transmission_over_Electric_Wire,_1876\n |title=Milestones:First Intelligible Voice Transmission over Electric Wire, 1876\n |date=\n |work=IEEE Global History Network\n |publisher=IEEE\n |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Variable resistance transmitters ==\n\n=== Water microphone \u2013 Elisha Gray ===\n\n[[Elisha Gray]] recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the [[Tin can telephone|lover's telegraph]], that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a [[patent caveat]] with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a [[water microphone|liquid microphone]]. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed \u2013 just barely \u2013 into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.\n\nWhen Gray applied for a patent for the variable resistance telephone transmitter, the [[United States Patent Office|Patent Office]] determined \"while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the ([[Liquid rheostat|variable resistance]]) invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered.\"<ref>Burton Baker, pages 90\u201391</ref>\n\n=== Carbon microphone \u2013 Thomas Edison, Edward Hughes, Emile Berliner ===\nThe carbon microphone was independently developed around 1878 by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.\n\n[[Thomas Alva Edison]] took the next step in improving the telephone with his invention in 1878 of the [[Carbon microphone|carbon grain \"transmitter\"]] (microphone) that provided a strong voice signal on the transmitting circuit that made long-distance calls practical. Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable [[electrical resistance]] that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters.\n\nThe carbon microphone was further improved by [[Emile Berliner]], [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake]], [[David E. Hughes]], [[Henry Hunnings]], and [[Anthony C. White|Anthony White]]. The carbon microphone remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, and is still being produced.\n\n== Improvements to the early telephone ==\n\nAdditional inventions such as the [[Ringing (telephony)|call bell]], [[telephone exchange|central telephone exchange]], [[common battery]], [[ringtone|ring tone]], [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[trunking|trunk lines]], and wireless phones \u2013 at first [[cordless telephone|cordless]] and then fully [[mobile phone|mobile]] \u2013 made the telephone the useful and widespread apparatus as it is now.\n\n\n=== Telephone exchanges ===\n\nThe telephone exchange was an idea of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] engineer [[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]] (1844\u20131893) in 1876, while he was working for [[Thomas Edison]] on a telegraph exchange.<ref>\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204071321/http://hungarian-history.hu/mszh/epuskas.htm Pusk\u00e1s Tivadar (1844\u20131893)] (short biography), Hungarian History website.

This caused Pusk\u00e1s to take a fresh look at his own work and he refocused on perfecting a design for a [[telephone exchange]]. He then got in touch with the U.S. inventor [[Thomas Edison]] who liked the design. According to Edison, \"Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange\".<ref>Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin.

Retrieved from Gutenberg.org.</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n{{Further information|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}\n{{See also|Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell}}\n\nBell has been widely recognized as the \"inventor\" of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter was for a long time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci ''\"<u>in</u> the invention of the telephone\"'' (not ''\"<u>for</u> the invention of the telephone\"''), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of the telephone to Bell.\n\nChampions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nOne of the valuable claims in Bell's 1876 {{US patent|174465}} was claim 4, a method of producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's [[patent drawing]]s, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his [[Patent caveat|caveat]] filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the variable resistance feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the variable resistance feature before January 18, 1876, \"almost at the last moment\" before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by Evenson<ref>Evenson, pp 64\u201369, 86\u201387, 110, 194\u2013196</ref> argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876.\n\nContrary to the popular story, Gray's caveat was taken to the US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and remained near the bottom of the in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier.<ref>Evenson, pages 68\u201369</ref> Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.\n\n== Memorial to the invention ==\n{{Main|Bell Telephone Memorial}}\n\nIn 1906 the citizens of the City of [[Brantford|Brantford, Ontario]], Canada and [[County of Brant|its surrounding area]] formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in July 1874 at his parents\u2019 home, Melville House, near Brantford.<ref name=\"Whitaker\">\n\nWhitaker, A.J.

The [[Chequers Estate Act 1917]] contains his reasoning and thoughts for the gift:\n\n{{quote|\u201cIt is not possible to foresee or foretell from what classes or conditions of life the future wielders of power in this country will be drawn. Some may be as in the past men of wealth and famous descent; some may belong to the world of trade and business; others may spring from the ranks of the manual toilers. To none of these in the midst of their strenuous and responsible labours could the spirit and anodyne of Chequers do anything but good. In the city-bred man especially, the periodic contact with the most typical rural life would create and preserve a just sense of proportion between the claims of town and country. To the revolutionary statesman the antiquity and calm tenacity of Chequers and its annals might suggest some saving virtues in the continuity of English history and exercise a check upon too hasty upheavals, whilst even the most reactionary could scarcely be insensible to the spirit of human freedom which permeates the countryside of Hampden, Burke and Milton.\n<br>\n\"Apart from these more subtle influences, the better the health of our rulers the more sanely will they rule and the inducement to spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods will, it is hoped, benefit the nation as well as its chosen leaders. The main features of this scheme are therefore designed not merely to make Chequers available as the official country residence of the Prime Minister of the day, but to tempt him to visit it regularly and to make it possible for him to live there, even though his income should be limited to his salary.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n\n==Location==\nDowning Street and Chequers are about {{convert|41|mi|km}} apart.\n\n[[The Ridgeway]] [[National Trails|National Trail]] crosses the private drive.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Chequers. - geograph.org.uk - 136199.jpg|Rear view of Chequers in 2006\nImage:Chequers from the Ridgeway with Coombe Hill behind - geograph.org.uk - 508456.jpg|Chequers from the Ridgeway with [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] behind it\nImage:Richard and Pat Nixon with Queen Elizabeth II.jpg|Queen Elizabeth II and [[Edward Heath]] with [[Richard Nixon|Richard]] and [[Pat Nixon]], 1970\nFile:Bush Blair at Chequers.jpg|[[Tony Blair]] welcomes U.S. President [[George W.
