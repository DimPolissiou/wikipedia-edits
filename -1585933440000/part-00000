The stannaries were: Foweymore (district of Bodmin Moor), Blackmore (district of St Austell); Tywarnhayle (district of St Agnes and Carn Brea); and Kerrier and Penwith (district between Godolphin and Land's End).

On assembly the stannators elected a speaker, the meeting being termed a Stannary Parliament. The parliaments were convened occasionally by the [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries]] when it was felt that laws concerning the miner's rights needed to be made or revised.\n\nThe Cornish Stannary Parliament last assembled at Truro in 1752, and continued until 11 September 1753.<ref>Lewis, Samuel (1831) ''Topographical Dictionary of England'', volume I</ref> In 1977, responding by letter to a written question in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] from [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Dafydd Wigley]] to the [[Attorney-General for England and Wales]], Lord Chancellor [[Lord Elwyn-Jones]] said he could find no record of the charter having been formally amended or withdrawn but also noted academic opinion that \"no doubt has ever been expressed about Parliament's power to enact legislation for the stannaries without the need to obtain the consent of Convocation\".<ref>In 1978 [[Dafydd Wigley]] deposited his papers regarding this in the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]].</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, [[Bridget Prentice]], [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], stated in a Commons written answer that \"there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence\" and that there \"are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/text/70329w0004.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 29 Mar 2007 (pt 0004) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Stannary courts==\n\n{{main|Courts of the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries}}\n\nThe Devon stannary courts met in [[Lydford]] and operated a prison there, while the Cornish stannary courts met primarily in [[Truro]].

The customs of the community were usually confirmed by charter, with the miners having the right to seek for minerals in all areas other than tilled fields, subject to paying taxes to [[the Crown]].\n\nExamples included:\n*[[Gloucestershire]]: The Free Miners of coal and iron of the [[Forest of Dean]] had their customs confirmed by charter attributed to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], with a miner's court to try cases between the miners, and a miner's parliament.\n*[[Derbyshire]]: The hundreds of [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] and [[Wirksworth]] (an area known as the \"King's Field\") were divided into eight \"liberties\" for the purposes of lead mining, and disputes were heard in the [[barmote court]]s.\n*[[Somerset]]: The customs of the lead-mining district of the [[Mendip Hills]] were encoded under [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Two courts, consisting of twelve miners, were held annually to enforce the code.\n*[[Cumberland]]: The lead miners of [[Alston Moor]] enjoyed legal privileges from the thirteenth century. By the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] there was in existence a court of mines, and the miners elected a coroner and bailiff, with the king's officers having no authority to serve writs in the area.<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n== Present day ==\n\n{{Further|Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament}}\n\nSome [[Cornwall|Cornish]] political activists claim to have revived the Stannary Parliament since 1974, along with the right to veto British legislation.  Indeed, it purports to have actually vetoed acts passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], although has been unable to enforce this.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOn 12 December 1974 the [[Home Office]] replied to letters from the members of this revived parliament, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. However, the stannaries were not abolished, and the Home Office has made no effort to hold these elections. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament is driven primarily by [[Cornish nationalism]] and demands for greater local autonomy, along with arguments about the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cornwall|Devon}}\n*[[Barmote court]] \u2013 similar institution for lead mining in Derbyshire\n*[[Stannary]]\n*[[List of topics related to Cornwall]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Henderson, Charles (1935) \"Black-more\", in his: ''Essays in Cornish History''; ed. by A.

In addition to restoring the stannaries and pardoning the people who participated in the rebellion, Henry's [[Charter of Pardon, 1508]] provided that no new laws affecting miners should be enacted without the consent of 24 stannators, six being chosen from each of the four stannaries:\n*[[Bodmin Moor|Foymore]] (or Foweymore): chosen by the mayor and corporation of [[Lostwithiel]]\n*[[Hensbarrow Downs|Blackmore]]: by the mayor and corporation of [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]<ref>The Blackmore Stannary, centred at [[Hensbarrow Beacon]], kept its records stored in the church of [[Luxulyan]].</ref>\n*[[Tywarnhaile]] (or Tynwarnhail): by the mayor and corporation of [[Truro]]\n*[[Penwith]] and [[Kerrier]]: by the mayor and corporation of [[Helston]]\n\nThe stannators were described in 1831 as being \"some of the principal gentlemen of the mining district\". On assembly the stannators elected a speaker, the meeting being termed a Stannary Parliament. The parliaments were convened occasionally by the [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries]] when it was felt that laws concerning the miner's rights needed to be made or revised.\n\nThe Cornish Stannary Parliament last assembled at Truro in 1752, and continued until 11 September 1753.<ref>Lewis, Samuel (1831) ''Topographical Dictionary of England'', volume I</ref> In 1977, responding by letter to a written question in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] from [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Dafydd Wigley]] to the [[Attorney-General for England and Wales]], Lord Chancellor [[Lord Elwyn-Jones]] said he could find no record of the charter having been formally amended or withdrawn but also noted academic opinion that \"no doubt has ever been expressed about Parliament's power to enact legislation for the stannaries without the need to obtain the consent of Convocation\".<ref>In 1978 [[Dafydd Wigley]] deposited his papers regarding this in the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]].</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, [[Bridget Prentice]], [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], stated in a Commons written answer that \"there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence\" and that there \"are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/text/70329w0004.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 29 Mar 2007 (pt 0004) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Stannary courts==\n\n{{main|Courts of the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries}}\n\nThe Devon stannary courts met in [[Lydford]] and operated a prison there, while the Cornish stannary courts met primarily in [[Truro]].  The Devon and Cornwall stannary courts were merged into a single Stannaries Court following the [[Stannaries Act 1855]], but their powers were later transferred to county authorities by the [[Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896]].<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1896| chapter = 45| act = Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896}}</ref>\n\nThe relations between the stannaries and [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] were discussed in ''[[Strode's Case]]'' (1512).\n\n== Mining courts and customs in other counties ==\n\nWhile the stannaries of Devon and Cornwall had the most developed legal systems, a number of other mining communities had similar privileges. The customs of the community were usually confirmed by charter, with the miners having the right to seek for minerals in all areas other than tilled fields, subject to paying taxes to [[the Crown]].\n\nExamples included:\n*[[Gloucestershire]]: The Free Miners of coal and iron of the [[Forest of Dean]] had their customs confirmed by charter attributed to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], with a miner's court to try cases between the miners, and a miner's parliament.\n*[[Derbyshire]]: The hundreds of [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] and [[Wirksworth]] (an area known as the \"King's Field\") were divided into eight \"liberties\" for the purposes of lead mining, and disputes were heard in the [[barmote court]]s.\n*[[Somerset]]: The customs of the lead-mining district of the [[Mendip Hills]] were encoded under [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Two courts, consisting of twelve miners, were held annually to enforce the code.\n*[[Cumberland]]: The lead miners of [[Alston Moor]] enjoyed legal privileges from the thirteenth century. By the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] there was in existence a court of mines, and the miners elected a coroner and bailiff, with the king's officers having no authority to serve writs in the area.<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n== Present day ==\n\n{{Further|Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament}}\n\nSome [[Cornwall|Cornish]] political activists claim to have revived the Stannary Parliament since 1974, along with the right to veto British legislation.  Indeed, it purports to have actually vetoed acts passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], although has been unable to enforce this.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOn 12 December 1974 the [[Home Office]] replied to letters from the members of this revived parliament, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. However, the stannaries were not abolished, and the Home Office has made no effort to hold these elections. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament is driven primarily by [[Cornish nationalism]] and demands for greater local autonomy, along with arguments about the [[constitutional status of Cornwall]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cornwall|Devon}}\n*[[Barmote court]] \u2013 similar institution for lead mining in Derbyshire\n*[[Stannary]]\n*[[List of topics related to Cornwall]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Henderson, Charles (1935) \"Black-more\", in his: ''Essays in Cornish History''; ed. by A.

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]].\nMidway through the [[1931 NFL season|1931 season]], the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 81\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 81</ref>\n\n===Wray and Bell era (1933\u20131940)===\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]] and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1931}}}} today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 82</ref> Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the [[National Recovery Administration]]\u2014the centerpiece of President [[Franklin D.

Although this makes it appear that the Yellow Jackets sat out the 1932 season and returned as the Eagles in 1933. However, neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster.\n\nThe Eagles, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the now-defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s. Wray became the Eagles first head coach after being convinced by Bell, his former teammate at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], to take the position. The team originally planned to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball club. When negotiations fell through the team managed to make a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] to play at the [[Baker Bowl]].\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, [[1933 NFL season|1933]], against the [[1933 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]].

Their best finish was in their second season, [[1934 NFL season|1934]], when they finished tied for third in the East. For the most part, the Eagles' early rosters were composed of former Penn, [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and [[Villanova Wildcats football|Villanova]] players who played for a few years before going on to other things.\n[[File:Aerial view of Municipal Stadium, Philadelphia, Pa (65080) (cropped1).jpg|left|thumb|[[John F.

The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports.

By [[1936 NFL season|1936]] the club had suffered significant financial losses and was sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team.

Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]], where they had played from 1936 to 1939. To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these \"east stands\" had 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=To Every Thing a Season: Shibe Park and Urban Philadelphia, 1909\u20131976 |last=Kuklick |first=Bruce |year=1993 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02104-X |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mN2Ejq-5VMC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> The team finished the 1937 season 2-8-1 and would continue to struggle over the next three seasons. \n[[File:Grand Stand Entrance of Shibe Park.jpg|thumb|[[Shibe Park|Connie Mack Stadium]] was the Eagles home field in 1940 and then from 1942-1957]]\n\n===Greasy Neale era (1941\u20131950)===\n{{See also|1947 NFL Championship Game|1948 NFL Championship Game|1949 NFL Championship Game}}\nIn December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of [[Art Rooney]]'s Steelers to [[Alexis Thompson (American football owner)|Alexis Thompson]],<ref name=\"Algeo: 16\">Algeo: 16</ref> and then Rooney acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 183\u2013184; cf.

The [[1942 NFL season|1942]] season showed no improvement as the team went 2-9.\n\n====\"Steagles\" (1943)====\nIn [[1943 NFL season|1943]] when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible to fill the roster, the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the \"[[Steagles]].\" Greasy Neale coached the team along with Steelers head coach [[Walt Kiesling]]. The team finished the season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record.

An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\nWith the turn of the decade came another turn in team fortunes. In [[1950 NFL season|1950]] the Eagles were slated to open the season against the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] champion [[Cleveland Browns]], who had just (along with the other AAFC franchises) joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who at the time were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never really recovered, and finished 6\u20136.\n\n===McMillin, Millner, Trimble and Devore era (1951-1957)===\nGreasy Neale retired after the 1950 season and was replaced by [[Bo McMillin]]. Two games into the [[1951 Philadelphia Eagles season|1951]] season, McMillin was forced to retire due to terminal [[stomach cancer]]. [[Wayne Millner]] finished out the season before being replaced by [[Jim Trimble]].\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and while younger players like Bobby Walston and [[Sonny Jurgensen]] occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the stuff of true greatness for most of the 1950s.\n\nAfter the [[1957 Philadelphia Eagles season|1957]] season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to [[Franklin Field]] at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.<ref name=\"The Eagles Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Eagles Encyclopedia |last=Didinger |first=Ray |author2=Robert S.

During the [[1959 NFL season|1959]] season the team showed real flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell, who at the time was the commissioner of the NFL, attended a game on October 11 at Franklin Field. The Eagles were facing the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team who Bell also used to own. The Eagles had box seats reserved for him but Bell refused them and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter of the game while sitting behind the end zone, he had suffered a heart attack and died later that day.      [[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|232x232px|Franklin Field was the Eagles home field from 1958 to 1970]]\n\n====NFL Champions (1960)====\n[[1960 NFL season|1960]] remains the most celebrated year in Eagles history. Shaw, Van Brocklin and [[Chuck Bednarik]] (each in his last season before retirement) led a team more notable for its grit than its talent (one observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\") to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, WR [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]] (who would later pen a short autobiography titled \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\") and TE [[Pete Retzlaff]]. On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL title game]] and dealt the mighty Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense.

Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach [[Nick Skorich]] instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion [[Minnesota Vikings]]. \nBack up quarterback [[Sonny Jurgensen]] became the starter for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]]. The team finished just a half-game behind the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil.\n\nThe [[1962 NFL season|1962]] team was decimated by injury, and managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss against the Packers. The off-field chaos would continue through [[1963 NFL season|1963]], as the remaining 65 shareholders out of the original Happy Hundred sold the team to [[Jerry Wolman]], a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]] Wolman hired former Cardinals and [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[Joe Kuharich]] to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs each year.\n\nIn [[1969 NFL season|1969]] [[Leonard Tose]] bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16.155 million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |title=Year-by-Year History |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104352/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |archivedate=January 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16155000|1969}}}} today), then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach [[Joe Kuharich]] after a disappointing 24\u201341\u20131 record during his five-year reign. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great [[Pete Retzlaff]] as [[General manager|General Manager]] and [[Jerry Williams (American football)|Jerry Williams]] as coach.\n\n[[File:VeteransStadium1986-2a.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Veterans Stadium, Eagles home field from 1971 to 2002.]]\nWith the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] of the NFL and [[American Football League|AFL]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Eagles were placed in the [[NFC East]] Division with their [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|archrivals]] the [[New York Giants]], the [[Washington Redskins]], and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their heated [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with the Giants is the oldest of the [[NFC East]] rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Birds' Biggest Rival\u2014In a division of fierce foes, the Giants have battled the Eagles as tough as anyone |date=September 17, 2006 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eagles\u2014Giants among top rivalries |date=November 6, 2008 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D6}}</ref> 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3-10-1.\n\nIn 1971 the Eagles moved from Franklin Field to brand-new [[Veterans Stadium]]. In its first season, the \u201cVet\u201d was widely acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering, a consensus that would be short-lived. Equally short-lived was Williams' tenure as head coach.  After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas and San Francisco to open the [[1971 NFL season|1971 season]], Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback [[Norm Snead]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman [[Pete Liske]] and the raw [[Rick Arrington]].\n\nKhayat lost his first two games, but won six of the final nine in 1971 thanks to the exploits of the defense, led by All-Pro safety [[Bill Bradley (American football)|Bill Bradley]], who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\nThe team regressed in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], and Khayat was released after the Eagles finished 2\u201311\u20131. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (which had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the [[Houston Oilers]] 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker [[Tom Dempsey]]. The latter game became known as the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl\", because the loser would finish with the worst record in the league and obtain the first overall draft pick of 1973, which was then assumed to be Nebraska wingback [[Johnny Rodgers]]. The Oilers ultimately got the first overall pick, which instead turned out to be University of Tampa defensive end [[John Matuszak]] (who would end up facing Philadelphia in the Super Bowl several years later). With the second pick, the Eagles selected [[USC Trojans football|USC]] tight end [[Charle Young]].\n\n===Mike McCormack era (1973-1975)===\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]], for the [[1973 NFL season|1973 season]]. Aided by the skills of [[Roman Gabriel]] and towering young receiver [[Harold Carmichael]], they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\nNew general manager [[Jim Murray (American football)|Jim Murray]] also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker [[Bill Bergey]] in [[1974 NFL season|1974]]. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]].\n\n===Dick Vermeil era (1976\u20131982)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XV}}\nIn {{nfly|1976}}, [[Dick Vermeil]] was hired from [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |title=Eagles search ends with Vermeil |date=February 9, 1976 |work=St Petersburg Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117035452/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the [[1976 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] finished [[1976 NFL season|1976]] with the same result\u2014a 4\u201310 record\u2014as in 1975. In [[1977 NFL season|1977]] the first seeds of hope begin to sprout. Rifle-armed quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] was obtained by trade with the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charlie Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], began earning a reputation as one of the hardest hitting in the league. [[File:dickvermeil.jpg|thumb|288x288px|right|[[Dick Vermeil]], Eagles head coach from 1976 to 1982]]\nBy the [[1977 NFL season|next year]], the Eagles had fully taken Vermeil's enthusiastic attitude, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1960. Young running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a single season. [[1978 NFL season|1978]] also bore witness to one of the greatest moments in Eagles history: \"[[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]],\" when [[Herman Edwards]] returned a late-game fumble by [[1978 New York Giants season|Giants]]' quarterback [[Joe Pisarcik]] for a touchdown with 20 seconds left, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory \u2013 the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would edge into the playoffs that year with a 9\u20137 season.) In [[1979 NFL season|1979]] the Eagles tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record and Wilbert Montgomery shattered the team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Eagles playing against the Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]In [[1980 NFL season|1980]] the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], in the NFC Championship. The game was played in cold conditions in front of the Birds' faithful fans at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Led by an incredible rushing performance from Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is surely one of the most memorable plays in Eagles history, and a gutsy performance from fullback [[Leroy Harris (running back)|Leroy Harris]], who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in [[Super Bowl XV]] with a 20\u20137 victory.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 05 - Wilbert Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The Eagles defeated the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]] and earned their first Super Bowl appearance.|alt=]]\n\nThe Eagles traveled to [[New Orleans]] for [[Super Bowl XV]] and were heavy favorites to knock off the [[Oakland Raiders]], who were merely a wild card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with the disastrous decision by Tose to bring comedian [[Don Rickles]] into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Veteran journeyman quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] was named the game's MVP.\n\nThe team got off to a great start in the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], winning their first six games. They eventually ended up 10\u20136 and earned a wild card berth. However, they were unable to repeat as NFC champs when they were knocked out in the wild card round by the [[New York Giants]], 27\u201321. After the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout.\"\n\n===Marion Campbell era (1983-1985)===\nDefensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], aka \"the Swamp Fox\" replaced Vermeil as the head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia football struggled through the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. The team could not produce the same success they once had and failed to make the playoffs in [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]] Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to [[Norman Braman]] and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|65000000|1985}}}} today) to pay off his more than $25&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000000|1985}}}} today) in gambling debts at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] casinos. The team once again struggled during the 1985 season and Marion Campbell was fired after week 16 and replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach [[Fred Bruney]] for the last game of the season.\n\nAt the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to [[Memphis Showboats]]' elite pass rusher [[Reggie White]].\n\n===Buddy Ryan era (1986\u20131990)===\n[[File:Reggie White HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie White]]'s jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]In [[1986 NFL season|1986]] the arrival of head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his tough, hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher personalities. Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. [[Randall Cunningham]] took his place, and despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, he began showing considerable promise. [[1987 NFL season|1987]] saw another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]], reducing the season by one game. The substitutes who were filling in for the strikers turned in a poor performance, being crushed 41\u201322 by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. After the strike ended, the regular Eagles [[1981 NFL season|1981]] team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, three games having been played by substitutes. The [[1988 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would reach the [[1988\u201389 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], but lost to the [[Chicago Bears]], which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a [[Super Bowl XX]] victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\", due to the weather conditions during the game. The Eagles lost this game 20\u201312.\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team could not make it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to many Eagles fans, as the team was commonly acknowledged as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]]; and running back [[Keith Byars]]. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.\n\n[[File:Jerome Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles (ca. 1991).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerome Brown]], Eagles defensive end from 1987 to 1991]]\nThe two [[1989 NFL season|1989]] matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], putting a \"bounty\" on their kicker, and for Eagles fans throwing snowballs.\n\nOn November 12, 1990, during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at the Vet, the [[1990 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] crushed the [[Washington Redskins]] by a score of 28\u201314, with the defense scoring three of the team's four touchdowns. More lopsided than its score would indicate, the game quickly acquired the sobriquet \"[[the Body Bag Game]]\", attesting to the physical damage inflicted by the tough Eagles squad. The Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement as well. Running back [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]], who would later be signed by the Eagles, was forced to play quarterback for the Redskins. The Redskins returned to Veterans Stadium in the first round of the [[1990\u201391 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season.\n\n===Rich Kotite era (1991-1994)===\nBuddy Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Rich Kotite]]. The team started the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991]] season losing starting quarterback Randall Cunningham in Week 1 due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] took over the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top rated defense in the league the team failed to make the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10-6.\n\nOn June 25, 1992 All Pro defensive tackle [[Jerome Brown]] was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base became dedicated to \"bring it home for Jerome\" in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season. The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11-5 record and earned a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the Wild Card game but would ultimately fall to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. To make matters worse they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.\n\nAmong the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]], tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]], and running back [[Herschel Walker]]. But the \"Gang Green\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by [[Reggie White]], [[Jerome Brown]], [[Clyde Simmons]], [[Seth Joyner]], [[Wes Hopkins]], [[Mike Golic]], [[Byron Evans]], [[Eric Allen]], [[Andre Waters]] and [[Mark McMillian]]. In [[1993 NFL season|1993]] Kotite's Eagles would fall apart after initially a promising start, and missed the playoffs, going 8\u20138.\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nBy this point, team owner Norman Braman had become unpopular among most local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. [[Jeffrey Lurie]] bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 for an estimated $185&nbsp;million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314&nbsp;billion, as evaluated in 2014 by Forbes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles |title=The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams No. 11 Philadelphia Eagles |work=[[Forbes.com]] |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185913/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles/ |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[File:Jeffrey-Lurie August-2010.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Jeffrey Lurie]] has owned the Eagles since 1994]]In Lurie's first season as the owner in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team went 7\u20139 and once again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and was replaced by [[San Francisco 49ers]] Defensive Coordinator [[Ray Rhodes]], who successfully lobbied 49ers star [[Ricky Watters]] to join the team as a free agent.\n\n===Ray Rhodes era (1995-1998)===\nIn [[1995 NFL season|1995]], Rhodes's first season, the [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] got off to a slow start by losing 3 out their first 4 games but subsequently rebounded, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles played at home and overwhelmed the [[Detroit Lions]] 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter alone. Despite this dominant performance, the Eagles were eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys yet again by a score of 30\u201311. Ironically, this would be [[Randall Cunningham]]'s last game as an Eagle. Cunningham would score the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n1995 was the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of [[Rodney Peete]], leading to friction between the two. Before the benching, news reports circulated that Lurie and Rhodes tried to trade Cunningham to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. However, no such trade was executed and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]] the [[1996 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] uniforms changed from the classic shade of [[Kelly green|Kelly Green]] to a darker [[midnight green]]. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a Week 5 Monday night game at [[Veterans Stadium]] against the hated [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] would witness a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by [[Ty Detmer]] and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season followed an all-too-familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record, and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]) in the [[1996\u201397 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In the [[1996 NFL draft]], future fan favorite and hall of famer [[Brian Dawkins]] was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led to fans and local media blaming the high priced free agent signings ([[Irving Fryar]], Watters, [[Troy Vincent]], and [[Guy McIntyre]]) for not stepping up in big games, most notably the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; When Willpower Isn't Enough: Decline of Ray Rhodes's Eagles|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=November 4, 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215024205/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> After an up-and-down 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], the bottom fell out in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. The Eagles suffered a 3\u201313 record\u2014the worst in franchise history. They were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics. Home game attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach [[Andy Reid]] as the new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|title=Eagles hire Packers assistant Andy Reid as new head coach|first=Phil|last=Sheridan|date=|website=www.philly.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030105006/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Andy Reid era (1999\u20132012)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XXXIX}}\nResurgence would come under the leadership of new head coach [[Andy Reid]], who began by drafting [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with the second overall pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. The Eagles would have had the first overall pick, but it was awarded to the rebooted [[Cleveland Browns]]. Despite clearing up roster space for new talent by releasing unpopular, aging veterans such as Watters and [[Irving Fryar]], Reid was still a virtual unknown at the time of his selection as head coach, and his appointment was met with considerable skepticism in Philadelphia. McNabb was also not considered a good choice to draft by Eagles fans. When he was drafted, many Eagles fans booed the selection, believing that the Eagles should have drafted [[Ricky Williams]]. [[File:Andy Reid 080805-F-9429S-131 crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Andy Reid]], Eagles head coach from 1999 to 2012]]\nThe choice proved wise, though: with Reid leading the way and McNabb emerging as one of the game's great players. However, 1999 was a rebuilding year, and the Eagles only won five games and game attendance was still looking stale: as two home games were not sold out \u2013 resulting in local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|TV blackouts]]- while the other six were only sold out due to several small business owners purchasing the remainder of the unsold tickets to spare TV viewers. The Week 5 game, on Sunday, October 10, 1999, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, saw Dallas wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] suffer a career-ending spinal injury where Eagles fans stood up and cheered as he lay on the field. Even the TV commentators expressed their disgust at this behavior.\n\nThe [[2000 NFL season|2000]] regular season opener in Dallas (September 3), became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in [[Texas Stadium]] was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set during a 1997 Cowboys-Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had been preparing for the projected high temperatures by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved a success as the Eagles won the game 44\u201314 and the Cowboys had multiple players benched for inability to handle the brutal temperatures (the Eagles had no players benched). The game also had significance because it marked the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East and the end of the Cowboys' dominance. The  team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] as a wildcard team, which rejuvenated the fan base and optimism. After brushing aside the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20133, the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose a 20\u201310 game against the [[New York Giants]].\n\n[[File:Donovan McNabb.jpg|thumb|right|210x210px|[[Donovan McNabb]], Eagles quarterback from 1999 to 2009]]After compiling an 11\u20135 record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] reached the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again, this time at the top of their division. In a near-rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] 33\u201319 at [[Soldier Field]]. Reaching the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the [[St. Louis Rams]], who defeated them 29\u201324\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] to a 12\u20134 season in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship, but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the last game at [[Veterans Stadium]].\n\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003]] team lost its first two games, both at their new home. In the opening game of the season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first regular season game ever played at [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season. By reaching the conference championship game in the same year as this defeat, they became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown catches all year from their wide receivers, which tied the league low since the regular season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the [[New York Giants]]' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch \u2014 the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945.\n\n[[File:Le Lincoln Financial Field (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|254x254px|Lincoln Financial Field has been the Eagles home field since 2003]]The Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], on March 16, 2004.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 Ravens, Niners compensated in settlement-ESPN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113063228/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 |date=January 13, 2016 }} Retrieved 10 July 2012.</ref> The [[2004 NFL season|2004]] season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the [[New York Giants]]. Owens would end up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury an on December 19 game, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row.  The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|1997 San Francisco 49ers]]. Their final two regular season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost them both, yet still finished with a 13\u20133 record, their best 16-game season ever.\n\n[[File:Bdawk.jpg|thumb|237x237px|[[Brian Dawkins]], Eagles safety from 1996 to 2008|alt=]]McNabb had his finest season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), [[Brian Westbrook]] dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and [[Freddie Mitchell]] performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the [[Atlanta Falcons]], McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they faced the [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\nBrian Dawkins was one of the premier safeties in the NFL, and earned him the role of Eagles' defensive captain, and a mainstay on the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=John|title=Denver's Brian Dawkins: An Ageless Wolverine|url=http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|publisher=BroncoTalk|accessdate=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128221118/http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|archive-date=January 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe team took a step back in [[2005 NFL season|2005]] with a 6\u201310 record.

For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil.  However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game, but lost in the Divisional Round. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], they finished 8-8.

A hamstring injury took [[Michael Vick]] out after a 1\u20133 start, but his backup [[Nick Foles]] led the team to a 10\u20136 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by [[Peyton Manning]]. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game, with seven, against the [[Oakland Raiders]], which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by [[Tom Brady]], in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect [[passer rating]]. [[LeSean McCoy]] finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season high set back in 1948.

In a week 14 game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], starting quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] left the game with a torn ACL, and backup [[Nick Foles]], who was re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.\n\nFoles' first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the [[New York Giants]] where he scored four touchdowns and won the game 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games. Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16. Foles led the Eagles past the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the Divisional Round 15\u201310. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u20137, despite being betting underdogs for the game. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Eagles traveled to [[Minneapolis]] to compete in [[Super Bowl LII]], their third attempt at a title, against [[Tom Brady]] and the [[New England Patriots]] in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] from 2005.[[File:Nick Foles 2014 Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Foles]] was named as [[Super Bowl LII]]'s most valuable player.|200px]][[File:Super Bowl 1F2868F4.jpg|thumb|left|Zach Ertz after catching a touchdown in [[Super Bowl LII]]|235x235px]]\nWith Foles at the helm, the game's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles taking only three plays: a short pass from Foles to [[Nelson Agholor]], a 36-yard run up the middle by [[LeGarrette Blount]], and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Foles to Alshon Jeffery on the left side of the field. The ensuing extra point attempt from Elliott was missed wide right, which made the score 9\u20133 in favor of the Eagles.

Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a similar trick play to the one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would become the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end [[Trey Burton]], who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The play came to be known as the [[Philly Special]].<ref name=PBP/> The Eagles won their first [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in franchise history,<ref name=PBP /> and their first league championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years.\n\n[[File:Super Bowl 402EF3AA.jpg|thumb|Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation after the game.|240x240px|alt=|left]] New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33\u201332. The Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end [[Zach Ertz]]. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by [[Jake Elliott]] to make the final score 41\u201333. The franchise won their first Super Bowl ever and their first championship since 1960. Foles won [[Super Bowl MVP]] going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for [[Drew Bledsoe]] in 2002's [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in [[Super Bowl XXIX]] in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stites|first=Adam|title=The Patriots and Eagles gave us the 2nd highest-scoring Super Bowl ever|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|website=SB Nation|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 6, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131539/https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|archivedate=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), most yards gained by a team (613 for New England) and most points scored by a losing team (33).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBefore the [[2018 NFL season|2018]] season started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from the ACL injury that he sustained the previous season. Nick Foles would be the starting quarterback to begin the season and helped the team win their opening game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] by a score of 18-12. Throughout the 2018 season many injuries plagued the team, especially in their secondary. [[Jalen Mills]], [[Ronald Darby]], and [[Rodney McLeod]] all went down with injuries during the season. The Eagles had a 4\u20136 record in their first 10 games and looked to have very little chance of making the playoffs, but the Eagles managed to win 5 of their last 6 games, including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans to go 9\u20137 and make the playoffs as the sixth seed.\n\nIn the Wild Card game against the [[Chicago Bears]] Nick Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16\u201315 win. Bears kicker [[Cody Parkey]] missed a game winning field goal that hit left post and the crossbar. The kick was tipped slightly by [[Treyvon Hester]]. This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to a NFC Divisional matchup against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. In the NFC Division match with the Saints, the Eagles ended the first quarter with a 14\u20130 lead. However, the offense was unable to get any more points as the Saints defense got pressure on Nick Foles and the Eagles ended up losing by a score of 20\u201314, ending their opportunity to defend their Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn 2019 the Eagles matched their 9\u20137 record from 2018.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the [[Baltimore Colts]], became the second team ever in the NFL to put a [[Logo#Sports|logo]] on their [[football helmet|helmets]], with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69\u201372, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\nIn 1973 the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.\n\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\n\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at [[Veterans Stadium]], a win over the division-rival [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected [[home (sports)|home]] games each season (usually the first home game after a [[bye (sports)|bye]] week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green [[road (sports)|road]] pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] night game against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore [[throwback uniform|\"throwback\" jerseys]] in a 2007 game against the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on [[flag of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's city flag]], are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212544/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |title=Eagles Unveil 75th Anniversary Plans |publisher=Philadelphia Eagles |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |title=Eagles Announce Plans to Honor 1960 Title Team |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730121316/http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |archivedate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\nFor the 2012 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Reebok]] as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63\u201351. They have been close in recent years, with both teams winning 12 games since 2006. There is a lot of hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 [[Bounty Bowl]]. The rivalry has even spilled over into [[NFL Draft|Draft Weekend]], with Cowboys legend [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and Eagles legend [[David Akers]] exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in [[2017 NFL Draft|2017]] and [[2018 NFL Draft|2018]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|title=Cowboys legend Drew Pearson hilariously trolled Eagles fans like wrestling heel|first=Jeanna|last=Thomas|date=April 28, 2017|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423203844/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|title=Akers torches Cowboys before announcing Eagles' pick|author=|date=April 27, 2018|website=NBC Sports Philadelphia|access-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404080813/https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{Main|Eagles-Giants rivalry}}\nThe rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic [[New York City|New York]]-[[Philadelphia]] rivalry, which is mirrored in [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry]].

It started in 1934, when the Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Redskins; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130. The Redskins lead the all-time series 86\u201380\u20138. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are both located in [[Pennsylvania]] and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Colts]]) moved to the [[American Football Conference]], while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [[National Football Conference]]. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 34\u20133. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [[Super Bowl]] era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 47\u201328\u20133.\n\n==Players==\n{{Main|List of Philadelphia Eagles players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Philadelphia Eagles roster}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|'''Philadelphia Eagles retired numbers'''\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"| No.\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Player\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Position\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Years played\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Retired\n|-\n| '''5''' || [[Donovan McNabb]] || [[Quarterback|QB]] || 1999\u20132009 || September 20, 2013\n|-\n| '''15''' || [[Steve Van Buren]] || [[Halfback (American football)|HB]] || 1944\u20131951 || 1951\n|-\n| '''20''' || [[Brian Dawkins]] || [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|S]] || 1996\u20132008 || September 30, 2012\n|-\n| '''40''' || [[Tom Brookshier]] || [[Cornerback|CB]] || 1953\u20131961 || 1962\n|-\n| '''44''' || [[Pete Retzlaff]] || [[Running back|RB]], [[Wide receiver|WR]], [[Tight end|TE]] || 1956\u20131966 || 1965\n|-\n| '''60''' || [[Chuck Bednarik]] || [[Linebacker|LB]], [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1949\u20131962 || \n|-\n| '''70''' || [[Al Wistert]] || [[Offensive tackle|OT]] || 1943\u20131951 || 1952\n|-\n| '''92''' || [[Reggie White]]<sup>(*)</sup> || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1985\u20131992 || December 5, 2005\n|-\n| '''99''' || [[Jerome Brown]]<sup>(*)</sup> || [[Defensive tackle|DT]] || 1987\u20131991 || September 6, 1992\n|}\n\n'''Notes:'''\n* <sup>(*)</sup> Posthumous honors.\n* Despite not being retired, the Eagles have not issued out [[Randall Cunningham]]'s No. 12 since he left the Eagles in 1995,<ref>{{cite news |author=Didinger, Ray |title=Ray's QB Notes 4: Randall's No. 12 retired? |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/eagles-talk/Rays-QB-Notes-4-Randalls-No-12-retired?blockID=743807 |work=CSN Philly |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130120030648/http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/eagles-talk/Rays-QB-Notes-4-Randalls-No-12-retired?blockID=743807 |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> [[LeSean McCoy]]'s No. 25 since he left the team in 2015,<ref>{{cite news |author=Gowton, Brandon Lee |title=Eagles announce jersey number for Jay Ajayi |url=https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/10/31/16586076/eagles-jay-ajayi-jersey-number-philadelphia-36-nfl-trade-miami-dolphins-running-back-uniform-buy-nfl |publisher=bleedinggreennation.com |date=October 31, 2017 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821223212/https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/10/31/16586076/eagles-jay-ajayi-jersey-number-philadelphia-36-nfl-trade-miami-dolphins-running-back-uniform-buy-nfl |archive-date=August 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=ZBerm |title=Re: This tweet: It's not a coincidence that Eagles haven't issued No. 25 in five years -- just like they haven't given No. 12 since Randall Cunningham.

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]].\nMidway through the [[1931 NFL season|1931 season]], the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 81\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 81</ref>\n\n===Wray and Bell era (1933\u20131940)===\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]] and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1931}}}} today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 82</ref> Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the [[National Recovery Administration]]\u2014the centerpiece of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\" />\u2014Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. Although this makes it appear that the Yellow Jackets sat out the 1932 season and returned as the Eagles in 1933. However, neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster.\n\nThe Eagles, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the now-defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s. Wray became the Eagles first head coach after being convinced by Bell, his former teammate at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], to take the position.

An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\nWith the turn of the decade came another turn in team fortunes. In [[1950 NFL season|1950]] the Eagles were slated to open the season against the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] champion [[Cleveland Browns]], who had just (along with the other AAFC franchises) joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who at the time were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never really recovered, and finished 6\u20136.\n\n===McMillin, Millner, Trimble and Devore era (1951-1957)===\nGreasy Neale retired after the 1950 season and was replaced by [[Bo McMillin]]. Two games into the [[1951 Philadelphia Eagles season|1951]] season, McMillin was forced to retire due to terminal [[stomach cancer]].

Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.<ref name=\"The Eagles Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Eagles Encyclopedia |last=Didinger |first=Ray |author2=Robert S.

During the [[1959 NFL season|1959]] season the team showed real flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell, who at the time was the commissioner of the NFL, attended a game on October 11 at Franklin Field. The Eagles were facing the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team who Bell also used to own. The Eagles had box seats reserved for him but Bell refused them and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter of the game while sitting behind the end zone, he had suffered a heart attack and died later that day.      [[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|232x232px|Franklin Field was the Eagles home field from 1958 to 1970]]\n\n====NFL Champions (1960)====\n[[1960 NFL season|1960]] remains the most celebrated year in Eagles history. Shaw, Van Brocklin and [[Chuck Bednarik]] (each in his last season before retirement) led a team more notable for its grit than its talent (one observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\") to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, WR [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]] (who would later pen a short autobiography titled \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\") and TE [[Pete Retzlaff]]. On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL title game]] and dealt the mighty Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense.

Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach [[Nick Skorich]] instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion [[Minnesota Vikings]]. \nBack up quarterback [[Sonny Jurgensen]] became the starter for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]]. The team finished just a half-game behind the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil.\n\nThe [[1962 NFL season|1962]] team was decimated by injury, and managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss against the Packers. The off-field chaos would continue through [[1963 NFL season|1963]], as the remaining 65 shareholders out of the original Happy Hundred sold the team to [[Jerry Wolman]], a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]] Wolman hired former Cardinals and [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[Joe Kuharich]] to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs each year.\n\nIn [[1969 NFL season|1969]] [[Leonard Tose]] bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16.155 million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |title=Year-by-Year History |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104352/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |archivedate=January 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16155000|1969}}}} today), then a record for a professional sports franchise.

He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great [[Pete Retzlaff]] as [[General manager|General Manager]] and [[Jerry Williams (American football)|Jerry Williams]] as coach.\n\n[[File:VeteransStadium1986-2a.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Veterans Stadium, Eagles home field from 1971 to 2002.]]\nWith the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] of the NFL and [[American Football League|AFL]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Eagles were placed in the [[NFC East]] Division with their [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|archrivals]] the [[New York Giants]], the [[Washington Redskins]], and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their heated [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with the Giants is the oldest of the [[NFC East]] rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Birds' Biggest Rival\u2014In a division of fierce foes, the Giants have battled the Eagles as tough as anyone |date=September 17, 2006 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eagles\u2014Giants among top rivalries |date=November 6, 2008 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D6}}</ref> 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3-10-1.\n\nIn 1971 the Eagles moved from Franklin Field to brand-new [[Veterans Stadium]]. In its first season, the \u201cVet\u201d was widely acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering, a consensus that would be short-lived. Equally short-lived was Williams' tenure as head coach.  After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas and San Francisco to open the [[1971 NFL season|1971 season]], Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback [[Norm Snead]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman [[Pete Liske]] and the raw [[Rick Arrington]].\n\nKhayat lost his first two games, but won six of the final nine in 1971 thanks to the exploits of the defense, led by All-Pro safety [[Bill Bradley (American football)|Bill Bradley]], who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\nThe team regressed in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], and Khayat was released after the Eagles finished 2\u201311\u20131. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (which had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the [[Houston Oilers]] 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker [[Tom Dempsey]]. The latter game became known as the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl\", because the loser would finish with the worst record in the league and obtain the first overall draft pick of 1973, which was then assumed to be Nebraska wingback [[Johnny Rodgers]]. The Oilers ultimately got the first overall pick, which instead turned out to be University of Tampa defensive end [[John Matuszak]] (who would end up facing Philadelphia in the Super Bowl several years later). With the second pick, the Eagles selected [[USC Trojans football|USC]] tight end [[Charle Young]].\n\n===Mike McCormack era (1973-1975)===\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]], for the [[1973 NFL season|1973 season]]. Aided by the skills of [[Roman Gabriel]] and towering young receiver [[Harold Carmichael]], they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\nNew general manager [[Jim Murray (American football)|Jim Murray]] also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker [[Bill Bergey]] in [[1974 NFL season|1974]]. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]].\n\n===Dick Vermeil era (1976\u20131982)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XV}}\nIn {{nfly|1976}}, [[Dick Vermeil]] was hired from [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |title=Eagles search ends with Vermeil |date=February 9, 1976 |work=St Petersburg Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117035452/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the [[1976 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] finished [[1976 NFL season|1976]] with the same result\u2014a 4\u201310 record\u2014as in 1975. In [[1977 NFL season|1977]] the first seeds of hope begin to sprout. Rifle-armed quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] was obtained by trade with the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charlie Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], began earning a reputation as one of the hardest hitting in the league. [[File:dickvermeil.jpg|thumb|288x288px|right|[[Dick Vermeil]], Eagles head coach from 1976 to 1982]]\nBy the [[1977 NFL season|next year]], the Eagles had fully taken Vermeil's enthusiastic attitude, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1960. Young running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a single season. [[1978 NFL season|1978]] also bore witness to one of the greatest moments in Eagles history: \"[[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]],\" when [[Herman Edwards]] returned a late-game fumble by [[1978 New York Giants season|Giants]]' quarterback [[Joe Pisarcik]] for a touchdown with 20 seconds left, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory \u2013 the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would edge into the playoffs that year with a 9\u20137 season.) In [[1979 NFL season|1979]] the Eagles tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record and Wilbert Montgomery shattered the team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Eagles playing against the Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]In [[1980 NFL season|1980]] the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], in the NFC Championship. The game was played in cold conditions in front of the Birds' faithful fans at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Led by an incredible rushing performance from Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is surely one of the most memorable plays in Eagles history, and a gutsy performance from fullback [[Leroy Harris (running back)|Leroy Harris]], who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in [[Super Bowl XV]] with a 20\u20137 victory.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 05 - Wilbert Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The Eagles defeated the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]] and earned their first Super Bowl appearance.|alt=]]\n\nThe Eagles traveled to [[New Orleans]] for [[Super Bowl XV]] and were heavy favorites to knock off the [[Oakland Raiders]], who were merely a wild card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with the disastrous decision by Tose to bring comedian [[Don Rickles]] into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Veteran journeyman quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] was named the game's MVP.\n\nThe team got off to a great start in the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], winning their first six games. They eventually ended up 10\u20136 and earned a wild card berth. However, they were unable to repeat as NFC champs when they were knocked out in the wild card round by the [[New York Giants]], 27\u201321. After the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout.\"\n\n===Marion Campbell era (1983-1985)===\nDefensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], aka \"the Swamp Fox\" replaced Vermeil as the head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia football struggled through the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. The team could not produce the same success they once had and failed to make the playoffs in [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]] Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to [[Norman Braman]] and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|65000000|1985}}}} today) to pay off his more than $25&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000000|1985}}}} today) in gambling debts at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] casinos. The team once again struggled during the 1985 season and Marion Campbell was fired after week 16 and replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach [[Fred Bruney]] for the last game of the season.\n\nAt the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to [[Memphis Showboats]]' elite pass rusher [[Reggie White]].\n\n===Buddy Ryan era (1986\u20131990)===\n[[File:Reggie White HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie White]]'s jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]In [[1986 NFL season|1986]] the arrival of head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his tough, hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher personalities. Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. [[Randall Cunningham]] took his place, and despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, he began showing considerable promise. [[1987 NFL season|1987]] saw another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]], reducing the season by one game. The substitutes who were filling in for the strikers turned in a poor performance, being crushed 41\u201322 by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. After the strike ended, the regular Eagles [[1981 NFL season|1981]] team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, three games having been played by substitutes. The [[1988 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would reach the [[1988\u201389 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], but lost to the [[Chicago Bears]], which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a [[Super Bowl XX]] victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\", due to the weather conditions during the game. The Eagles lost this game 20\u201312.\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team could not make it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to many Eagles fans, as the team was commonly acknowledged as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]]; and running back [[Keith Byars]]. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.\n\n[[File:Jerome Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles (ca. 1991).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerome Brown]], Eagles defensive end from 1987 to 1991]]\nThe two [[1989 NFL season|1989]] matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], putting a \"bounty\" on their kicker, and for Eagles fans throwing snowballs.\n\nOn November 12, 1990, during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at the Vet, the [[1990 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] crushed the [[Washington Redskins]] by a score of 28\u201314, with the defense scoring three of the team's four touchdowns. More lopsided than its score would indicate, the game quickly acquired the sobriquet \"[[the Body Bag Game]]\", attesting to the physical damage inflicted by the tough Eagles squad. The Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement as well. Running back [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]], who would later be signed by the Eagles, was forced to play quarterback for the Redskins. The Redskins returned to Veterans Stadium in the first round of the [[1990\u201391 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season.\n\n===Rich Kotite era (1991-1994)===\nBuddy Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Rich Kotite]]. The team started the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991]] season losing starting quarterback Randall Cunningham in Week 1 due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] took over the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top rated defense in the league the team failed to make the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10-6.\n\nOn June 25, 1992 All Pro defensive tackle [[Jerome Brown]] was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base became dedicated to \"bring it home for Jerome\" in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season. The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11-5 record and earned a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the Wild Card game but would ultimately fall to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. To make matters worse they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.\n\nAmong the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]], tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]], and running back [[Herschel Walker]]. But the \"Gang Green\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by [[Reggie White]], [[Jerome Brown]], [[Clyde Simmons]], [[Seth Joyner]], [[Wes Hopkins]], [[Mike Golic]], [[Byron Evans]], [[Eric Allen]], [[Andre Waters]] and [[Mark McMillian]]. In [[1993 NFL season|1993]] Kotite's Eagles would fall apart after initially a promising start, and missed the playoffs, going 8\u20138.\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nBy this point, team owner Norman Braman had become unpopular among most local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. [[Jeffrey Lurie]] bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 for an estimated $185&nbsp;million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314&nbsp;billion, as evaluated in 2014 by Forbes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles |title=The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams No. 11 Philadelphia Eagles |work=[[Forbes.com]] |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185913/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles/ |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[File:Jeffrey-Lurie August-2010.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Jeffrey Lurie]] has owned the Eagles since 1994]]In Lurie's first season as the owner in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team went 7\u20139 and once again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and was replaced by [[San Francisco 49ers]] Defensive Coordinator [[Ray Rhodes]], who successfully lobbied 49ers star [[Ricky Watters]] to join the team as a free agent.\n\n===Ray Rhodes era (1995-1998)===\nIn [[1995 NFL season|1995]], Rhodes's first season, the [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] got off to a slow start by losing 3 out their first 4 games but subsequently rebounded, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles played at home and overwhelmed the [[Detroit Lions]] 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter alone. Despite this dominant performance, the Eagles were eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys yet again by a score of 30\u201311. Ironically, this would be [[Randall Cunningham]]'s last game as an Eagle. Cunningham would score the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n1995 was the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of [[Rodney Peete]], leading to friction between the two. Before the benching, news reports circulated that Lurie and Rhodes tried to trade Cunningham to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. However, no such trade was executed and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]] the [[1996 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] uniforms changed from the classic shade of [[Kelly green|Kelly Green]] to a darker [[midnight green]]. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a Week 5 Monday night game at [[Veterans Stadium]] against the hated [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] would witness a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by [[Ty Detmer]] and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season followed an all-too-familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record, and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]) in the [[1996\u201397 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In the [[1996 NFL draft]], future fan favorite and hall of famer [[Brian Dawkins]] was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led to fans and local media blaming the high priced free agent signings ([[Irving Fryar]], Watters, [[Troy Vincent]], and [[Guy McIntyre]]) for not stepping up in big games, most notably the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; When Willpower Isn't Enough: Decline of Ray Rhodes's Eagles|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=November 4, 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215024205/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> After an up-and-down 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], the bottom fell out in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. The Eagles suffered a 3\u201313 record\u2014the worst in franchise history. They were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics. Home game attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach [[Andy Reid]] as the new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|title=Eagles hire Packers assistant Andy Reid as new head coach|first=Phil|last=Sheridan|date=|website=www.philly.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030105006/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Andy Reid era (1999\u20132012)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XXXIX}}\nResurgence would come under the leadership of new head coach [[Andy Reid]], who began by drafting [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with the second overall pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. The Eagles would have had the first overall pick, but it was awarded to the rebooted [[Cleveland Browns]]. Despite clearing up roster space for new talent by releasing unpopular, aging veterans such as Watters and [[Irving Fryar]], Reid was still a virtual unknown at the time of his selection as head coach, and his appointment was met with considerable skepticism in Philadelphia. McNabb was also not considered a good choice to draft by Eagles fans. When he was drafted, many Eagles fans booed the selection, believing that the Eagles should have drafted [[Ricky Williams]]. [[File:Andy Reid 080805-F-9429S-131 crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Andy Reid]], Eagles head coach from 1999 to 2012]]\nThe choice proved wise, though: with Reid leading the way and McNabb emerging as one of the game's great players. However, 1999 was a rebuilding year, and the Eagles only won five games and game attendance was still looking stale: as two home games were not sold out \u2013 resulting in local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|TV blackouts]]- while the other six were only sold out due to several small business owners purchasing the remainder of the unsold tickets to spare TV viewers. The Week 5 game, on Sunday, October 10, 1999, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, saw Dallas wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] suffer a career-ending spinal injury where Eagles fans stood up and cheered as he lay on the field. Even the TV commentators expressed their disgust at this behavior.\n\nThe [[2000 NFL season|2000]] regular season opener in Dallas (September 3), became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in [[Texas Stadium]] was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set during a 1997 Cowboys-Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had been preparing for the projected high temperatures by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved a success as the Eagles won the game 44\u201314 and the Cowboys had multiple players benched for inability to handle the brutal temperatures (the Eagles had no players benched). The game also had significance because it marked the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East and the end of the Cowboys' dominance. The  team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] as a wildcard team, which rejuvenated the fan base and optimism. After brushing aside the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20133, the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose a 20\u201310 game against the [[New York Giants]].\n\n[[File:Donovan McNabb.jpg|thumb|right|210x210px|[[Donovan McNabb]], Eagles quarterback from 1999 to 2009]]After compiling an 11\u20135 record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] reached the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again, this time at the top of their division. In a near-rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] 33\u201319 at [[Soldier Field]]. Reaching the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the [[St. Louis Rams]], who defeated them 29\u201324\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] to a 12\u20134 season in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship, but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the last game at [[Veterans Stadium]].\n\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003]] team lost its first two games, both at their new home. In the opening game of the season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first regular season game ever played at [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season. By reaching the conference championship game in the same year as this defeat, they became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown catches all year from their wide receivers, which tied the league low since the regular season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the [[New York Giants]]' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch \u2014 the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945.\n\n[[File:Le Lincoln Financial Field (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|254x254px|Lincoln Financial Field has been the Eagles home field since 2003]]The Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], on March 16, 2004.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 Ravens, Niners compensated in settlement-ESPN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113063228/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 |date=January 13, 2016 }} Retrieved 10 July 2012.</ref> The [[2004 NFL season|2004]] season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the [[New York Giants]]. Owens would end up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury an on December 19 game, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row.  The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|1997 San Francisco 49ers]]. Their final two regular season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost them both, yet still finished with a 13\u20133 record, their best 16-game season ever.\n\n[[File:Bdawk.jpg|thumb|237x237px|[[Brian Dawkins]], Eagles safety from 1996 to 2008|alt=]]McNabb had his finest season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), [[Brian Westbrook]] dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and [[Freddie Mitchell]] performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the [[Atlanta Falcons]], McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they faced the [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\nBrian Dawkins was one of the premier safeties in the NFL, and earned him the role of Eagles' defensive captain, and a mainstay on the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=John|title=Denver's Brian Dawkins: An Ageless Wolverine|url=http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|publisher=BroncoTalk|accessdate=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128221118/http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|archive-date=January 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe team took a step back in [[2005 NFL season|2005]] with a 6\u201310 record.

For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil.  However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game, but lost in the Divisional Round. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], they finished 8-8.

A hamstring injury took [[Michael Vick]] out after a 1\u20133 start, but his backup [[Nick Foles]] led the team to a 10\u20136 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by [[Peyton Manning]]. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game, with seven, against the [[Oakland Raiders]], which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by [[Tom Brady]], in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004.

[[LeSean McCoy]] finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL.

In a week 14 game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], starting quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] left the game with a torn ACL, and backup [[Nick Foles]], who was re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.\n\nFoles' first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the [[New York Giants]] where he scored four touchdowns and won the game 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games.

In the NFC Championship, the Eagles beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u20137, despite being betting underdogs for the game. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns.

As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end [[Trey Burton]], who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots.

The franchise won their first Super Bowl ever and their first championship since 1960. Foles won [[Super Bowl MVP]] going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown.

Throughout the 2018 season many injuries plagued the team, especially in their secondary. [[Jalen Mills]], [[Ronald Darby]], and [[Rodney McLeod]] all went down with injuries during the season. The Eagles had a 4\u20136 record in their first 10 games and looked to have very little chance of making the playoffs, but the Eagles managed to win 5 of their last 6 games, including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans to go 9\u20137 and make the playoffs as the sixth seed.\n\nIn the Wild Card game against the [[Chicago Bears]] Nick Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16\u201315 win. Bears kicker [[Cody Parkey]] missed a game winning field goal that hit left post and the crossbar. The kick was tipped slightly by [[Treyvon Hester]]. This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to a NFC Divisional matchup against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. In the NFC Division match with the Saints, the Eagles ended the first quarter with a 14\u20130 lead.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the [[Baltimore Colts]], became the second team ever in the NFL to put a [[Logo#Sports|logo]] on their [[football helmet|helmets]], with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69\u201372, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\nIn 1973 the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.\n\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\n\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at [[Veterans Stadium]], a win over the division-rival [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected [[home (sports)|home]] games each season (usually the first home game after a [[bye (sports)|bye]] week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green [[road (sports)|road]] pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] night game against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore [[throwback uniform|\"throwback\" jerseys]] in a 2007 game against the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on [[flag of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's city flag]], are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212544/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |title=Eagles Unveil 75th Anniversary Plans |publisher=Philadelphia Eagles |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |title=Eagles Announce Plans to Honor 1960 Title Team |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730121316/http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |archivedate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\nFor the 2012 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Reebok]] as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63\u201351. They have been close in recent years, with both teams winning 12 games since 2006. There is a lot of hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 [[Bounty Bowl]]. The rivalry has even spilled over into [[NFL Draft|Draft Weekend]], with Cowboys legend [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and Eagles legend [[David Akers]] exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in [[2017 NFL Draft|2017]] and [[2018 NFL Draft|2018]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|title=Cowboys legend Drew Pearson hilariously trolled Eagles fans like wrestling heel|first=Jeanna|last=Thomas|date=April 28, 2017|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423203844/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|title=Akers torches Cowboys before announcing Eagles' pick|author=|date=April 27, 2018|website=NBC Sports Philadelphia|access-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404080813/https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{Main|Eagles-Giants rivalry}}\nThe rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic [[New York City|New York]]-[[Philadelphia]] rivalry, which is mirrored in [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry]].

It started in 1934, when the Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Redskins; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130. The Redskins lead the all-time series 86\u201380\u20138. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are both located in [[Pennsylvania]] and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Colts]]) moved to the [[American Football Conference]], while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [[National Football Conference]]. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 34\u20133. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [[Super Bowl]] era.
