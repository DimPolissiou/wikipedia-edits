The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year.

UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

In 1774, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]] ordered an expedition to survey the bounds of these lands, sending out a few parties led by James Harrod, [[Thomas Bullitt]], Hancock Taylor, and the three McAfee brothers - Robert, James and George.<ref name=\"Skinner\" /> Harrod's company consisted of 31 men (including David and Thomas Glenn) and they departed from [[Fort Redstone]] in May, just south of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (present-day [[Pittsburgh]]), travelling down the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] Rivers and the [[Kentucky River]] to the current site of Harrodsburg where the town was laid out on June 16, 1774.<ref name=\"Collins'\" /><ref name=\"Rennick\" /> Rising tensions between the settlers and the Shawnee natives made Dunmore send two experienced frontiersmen out to warn the surveyors of threatened hostilities from the natives and have them return back to safety.

Harrod's company decided not to heed the warning and remained at the fort a few months until one of their men was killed, at which point, they returned to Virginia by the [[Cumberland Gap]] where the majority of the men enlisted in Captain Harrod's company of Kentucky Pioneers in the Fincastle County Battallion.<ref name=\"Virgil Anson Lewis\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Virgil Anson |title=History of the Battle of Point Pleasant Fought Between White Men and Indians at the Mouth of the Great Kanawha River (now Point Pleasant, West Virginia) Monday, October 10th, 1774: The Chief Event of Lord Dunmore's War |date=1909 |publisher=Tribune Printing Company |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyYiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=fincastle+battalion&source=bl&ots=cZrkZc_Tf-&sig=ACfU3U2T7ZFfgmC6Dbv1djl2MNr5ET7tnA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9gsaGi_XmAhWdGDQIHeUpC-cQ6AEwAnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=glenn&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Illinois Regiment and the Northwestern Territory |journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography |date=October 1893 |volume= 1 |issue= 2 |page=136 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4241740?seq=10#metadata_info_tab_contents/}}</ref> The Kentucky Pioneers were on route to [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]] but arrived about midnight on the 10th of October just after the [[Battle of Point Pleasant|battle]] had ended.<ref name=\"Collins'\" /><ref name=\"Virgil Anson Lewis\" /> This was the only major action of [[Dunmore's War]].\n\n== Revolutionary War ==\n\nDuring the early part of the revolution, David Glenn spent the majority of his time exploring the rich Kentucky territory, planting corn along Glenn's Creek (named after his brother, Thomas)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hammon |first1=Neal O. |title=Virginia's Western War: 1775-1786 |date=2002 |publisher=Stackpole Books |pages=xxvii, 18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ6g06-FNhwC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=who+is+glenns+creek+named+after+ky&source=bl&ots=PEHrIqi2j9&sig=ACfU3U3ERFqQ4KnOI5VzQ1VklEos3fucwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiymZSI8vfmAhWTrJ4KHV3bBGcQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and making other improvements from Frankfort down to Russell Springs.<ref name=\"Stamping Ground\">{{cite book |last1=Hammon |first1=Neal |title=HISTORIC LAWSUITS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY LOCATING \"THE STAMPING GROUND\" |date=July 1971 |publisher=Kentucky Historical Society |pages=197\u2013215 |edition=Vol. 69, No. 3 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23377292?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents}}</ref><ref name=\"KY Court\">{{cite book |last1=Kentucky |first1=Court of Appeals |title=Reports of Civil and Criminal Cases Decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky |date=1869 |publisher=State Journal Company |pages=5\u20136, 352, 364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=cyrus+mccracken+thomas+glenn&source=bl&ots=JNUdJbmlBA&sig=ACfU3U1i2yPloL0ag9hw1rNiipPqb6s-WA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1i6zX9oHnAhXNHjQIHfDtApAQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=glenn&f=false}}</ref> However, at the close of 1776, [[John Todd (Virginia)|Colonel John Todd]] had attempted to retrieve some gunpowder at Three Islands (near present-day [[Manchester, Ohio|Manchester]]) to resupply the Kentucky settlers, but was unsuccessful. In response, Harrod took his small company, which included David Glenn, and on January 2, 1777, they secured the powder and returned to Harrodsburg under the guidance of [[Simon Kenton]], taking the Ohio River down to a hidden buffalo road to avoid conflict with the natives.<ref name=\"Collins'\" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=English |first1=William Hayden |title=Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778-1783 |date=1897 |publisher=Bowen-Merrill Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/conquestofcountr6308engl/page/n211 79] |url=https://archive.org/details/conquestofcountr6308engl}}</ref> Had the powder not been delivered to the settlers, they would have been left defenseless and vulnerable to the very frequent Indian attacks.\n\nGlenn proved to be an effective hunter, being tasked with gathering provisions for Harrodsburg's population of ~200 people for quite some time, probably upwards to two years.<ref name=\"Collins'\" /><ref name=\"Kaskaskia\" /> He and his hunting partner, William Stewart (or Stuart), had a cabin about 50 miles south of Harrod's Station on Russell Creek used for storing meat and supplies where they had spent the winter of 1777-78 separated from the settlement, making several trips back and forth to stock the fort.

To Ananthram's satisfaction, the 1965 Kannada ACK venture was a great commercial success which led to Mirchandani in the head office in Mumbai pursuing the Amar Chitra Katha idea in English diligently. \"They brought in Anant Pai\" says Ananthram. \"And he built a wonderful team and a great brand.\"<ref>[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270843 A Pandit Had A Dream&nbsp;...

Based on available observational evidence, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe have now become valid cosmological questions, being beyond the mostly untestable constraints of mythological or theological beliefs. Many possible futures have been predicted by different scientific hypotheses, including that the universe might have existed for a finite and infinite duration, or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning.\n\nObservations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] during the 1920s\u20131950s found that galaxies appeared to be moving away from each other, leading to the currently accepted [[Big Bang theory]]. This suggests that the universe began \u2013 very small and very dense \u2013 about [[Age of universe|13.8 billion years]] ago, and it has expanded and (on average) become less dense ever since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011}}</ref> Confirmation of the Big Bang mostly depends on knowing the rate of expansion, average density of matter, and the physical properties of the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass\u2013energy]] in the universe.\n\nThere is a strong consensus among [[cosmologists]] that the universe is considered \"flat\" (see [[Shape of the universe]]) and will continue to expand forever.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\">{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html|title=WMAP- Shape of the Universe|author=|date=|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"map.gsfc.nasa.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|title=WMAP- Fate of the Universe|author=|date=|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFactors that need to be considered in determining the universe's origin and ultimate fate include: the average motions of galaxies, the shape and structure of the universe, and the amount of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] that the universe contains.it matters\n\n==Emerging scientific basis==\n{{See also|Timeline of cosmological theories|Chronology of the universe}}\n\n===Theory===\n\nThe theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 theory of [[general relativity]]. General relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale. There are many possible solutions to the equations of general relativity, and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe.\n\n[[Alexander Friedmann]] proposed several [[Friedmann equations|solution]]s in 1922, as did [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] in 1927.<ref name=Lemaitre1927>{{Cite journal | last=Lema\u00eetre | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lema\u00eetre | title=Un univers homog\u00e8ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n\u00e9buleuses extra-galactiques | date=1927 | journal=Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | pages=49\u201356 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L }} ''translated by [[A.

From then on, the ''beginning'' of the universe and its possible ''end'' have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation.\n\n===Big Bang and Steady State theories===\nIn 1927, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] set out a theory that has since come to be called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.<ref name=Lemaitre1927 /> In 1948, [[Fred Hoyle]] set out his opposing [[Steady state model|Steady State theory]] in which the universe continually expanded but remained statistically unchanged as new matter is constantly created. These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the original Steady State theory could not account for. As a result, the Big Bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\n===Cosmological constant===\nWhen Einstein formulated [[general relativity]], he and his contemporaries believed in a [[static universe]]. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a [[cosmological constant]], essentially a constant energy density unaffected by any expansion or contraction, whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was \"the greatest blunder of my life.\"<ref>[http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/de-did_einstein_predict.php Did Einstein Predict Dark Energy?], hubblesite.org</ref>\n\n===Density parameter===\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the [[density parameter]], omega (<math>\\Omega</math>), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether <math>\\Omega</math> is equal to, less than, or greater than <math>1</math>. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.

A steady increase in the Hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe, starting with galaxies and eventually (in a finite time) all forms, no matter how small,  disintegrating into unbound [[elementary particles]], radiation and beyond. As the energy density, scale factor and expansion rate become infinite the universe ends as what is effectively a singularity.\n\nIn the special case of [[phantom energy|phantom dark energy]], which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict, a more sudden big rip could occur.\n\n===Big Crunch===\n{{Main|Big Crunch}}\n\n[[File:Big crunch.png|256px|right|thumb|The Big Crunch. The vertical axis can be considered as expansion or contraction with time.]]\n\nThe [[Big Crunch]] hypothesis is a symmetric view of the ultimate fate of the universe. Just as the Big Bang started as a cosmological expansion, this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and begin contracting. The end result is unknown; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] back into how the universe started with the Big Bang, but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered (see [[Quantum gravity]]). Recent evidence suggests that this scenario is not likely but it has not been ruled out as measurements are only available over a short period of time and could reverse in the future.<ref name=\"astro-ph/0409264\"/>\n\nThis scenario allows the Big Bang to occur immediately after the Big Crunch of a preceding universe. If this happens repeatedly, it creates a [[cyclic model]], which is also known as an oscillatory universe. The universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes, with each finite universe ending with a Big Crunch that is also the Big Bang of the next universe. Theoretically, the cyclic universe could not{{vague|could not = \"might not\" or \"cannot\"?|date=January 2019}} be reconciled with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: entropy would build up from oscillation to oscillation and cause [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]. Current evidence also indicates the universe is not [[shape of the universe|closed]]. This has caused cosmologists to abandon the oscillating universe model. A somewhat similar idea is embraced by the [[cyclic model]], but this idea evades [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]] because of an expansion of the [[brane]]s that dilutes entropy accumulated in the previous cycle.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Big Bounce===\n{{Main|Big Bounce}}\n\nThe [[Big Bounce]] is a theorized scientific model related to the beginning of the known universe. It derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the Big Bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe.\n\nAccording to one version of the Big Bang theory of cosmology, in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense. Such a description seems to be at odds with other more widely accepted theories, especially quantum mechanics and its [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It is not surprising, therefore, that quantum mechanics has given rise to an alternative version of the Big Bang theory. Also, if the universe is closed, this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the Big Bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion.\n\nIn simple terms, this theory states that the universe will continuously repeat the cycle of a Big Bang, followed up with a Big Crunch.\n\n===Big Slurp===\n{{Main|False vacuum}}\n\nThis theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment.\n\nIn order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory, one must first understand the Higgs field which permeates the universe. Much like an electromagnetic field, it varies in strength based upon its potential. A true vacuum exists so long as the universe exists in its lowest energy state, in which case the false vacuum theory is irrelevant. However, if the vacuum is not in its lowest energy state (a [[false vacuum]]), it could [[quantum tunnelling|tunnel]] into a lower energy state.<ref name=\"fate\">\n* {{cite journal | author = M.

From then on, the ''beginning'' of the universe and its possible ''end'' have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation.\n\n===Big Bang and Steady State theories===\nIn 1927, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] set out a theory that has since come to be called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.<ref name=Lemaitre1927 /> In 1948, [[Fred Hoyle]] set out his opposing [[Steady state model|Steady State theory]] in which the universe continually expanded but remained statistically unchanged as new matter is constantly created. These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the original Steady State theory could not account for. As a result, the Big Bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\n===Cosmological constant===\nWhen Einstein formulated [[general relativity]], he and his contemporaries believed in a [[static universe]]. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a [[cosmological constant]], essentially a constant energy density unaffected by any expansion or contraction, whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was \"the greatest blunder of my life.\"<ref>[http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/de-did_einstein_predict.php Did Einstein Predict Dark Energy?], hubblesite.org</ref>\n\n===Density parameter===\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the [[density parameter]], omega (<math>\\Omega</math>), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether <math>\\Omega</math> is equal to, less than, or greater than <math>1</math>. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes. These three adjectives refer to the overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]], and not to the local curving of [[spacetime]] caused by smaller clumps of mass (for example, [[galaxies]] and [[star]]s). If the primary content of the universe is inert matter, as in the [[dust solution|dust models]] popular for much of the 20th century, there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry. Hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring <math>\\Omega</math>, or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating.\n\n===Repulsive force===\nStarting in 1998, observations of [[supernova]]s in distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been interpreted as consistent<ref>{{cite journal|title=Supernovae, an accelerating universe and the cosmological constant|first=Robert P.|last=Kirshner|date=13 April 1999|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=96|issue=8|pages=4224\u20134227|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.8.4224|pmid=10200242|pmc=33557|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.4224K}}</ref> with a universe whose [[accelerating universe|expansion is accelerating]]. Subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration, nearly always by invoking [[dark energy]], which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant. In general, dark energy is a catch-all term for any hypothesised field with negative pressure, usually with a density that changes as the universe expands.\n\n==Role of the shape of the universe==\n{{See also|Shape of the universe}}\n\n[[File:Friedmann universes.svg|thumb|400px|The ultimate fate of an expanding universe depends on the matter density <math>\\Omega _M</math> and the dark energy density <math>\\Omega _\\Lambda</math>]]\n\nThe current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape, how much [[dark energy]] it contains, and on the [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe.<ref name=\"map.gsfc.nasa.gov\"/> Recent observations conclude, from [[Graphical timeline of the Big Bang|7.5 billion years]] after the Big Bang, that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing, commensurate with the Open Universe theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/|title=Dark Energy, Dark Matter - Science Mission Directorate|author=|date=|website=science.nasa.gov}}</ref> However, other recent measurements by [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] suggest that the universe is either flat or very close to flat.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\"/>\n\n===Closed universe===\nIf <math>\\Omega > 1</math>, then the geometry of space is closed like the surface of a sphere. The sum of the angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees and there are no parallel lines; all lines eventually meet. The geometry of the universe is, at least on a very large scale, [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]].\n\nIn a closed universe, gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe, after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point, a final singularity termed the \"[[Big Crunch]]\", the opposite of the Big Bang.

The angles of a triangle sum to less than 180 degrees, and lines that do not meet are never equidistant; they have a point of least distance and otherwise grow apart. The geometry of such a universe is [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]].\n\nEven without dark energy, a negatively curved universe expands forever, with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} With dark energy, the expansion not only continues but accelerates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The ultimate fate of an open universe is either universal [[heat death of the universe|heat death]], the \"[[future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]]\",<!-- Not the same as a heat death - see below --> or the \"[[Big Rip]]\",{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} where the acceleration caused by dark energy eventually becomes so strong that it completely overwhelms the effects of the [[gravity|gravitational]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[strong force|strong]] binding forces.\n\nConversely, a ''negative'' [[cosmological constant]], which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure, would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch. This option has been ruled out by observations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Flat universe===\nIf the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that <math>\\Omega = 1</math>, then the geometry of the universe is flat: as in [[Euclidean geometry]], the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance. Measurements from [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] have confirmed the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\"/>\n\nIn absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The ultimate fate of the universe is the same as an open universe.\n\n==Theories about the end of the universe==\nThe fate of the universe is determined by its density.

A steady increase in the Hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe, starting with galaxies and eventually (in a finite time) all forms, no matter how small,  disintegrating into unbound [[elementary particles]], radiation and beyond. As the energy density, scale factor and expansion rate become infinite the universe ends as what is effectively a singularity.\n\nIn the special case of [[phantom energy|phantom dark energy]], which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict, a more sudden big rip could occur.\n\n===Big Crunch===\n{{Main|Big Crunch}}\n\n[[File:Big crunch.png|256px|right|thumb|The Big Crunch. The vertical axis can be considered as expansion or contraction with time.]]\n\nThe [[Big Crunch]] hypothesis is a symmetric view of the ultimate fate of the universe. Just as the Big Bang started as a cosmological expansion, this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and begin contracting. The end result is unknown; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] back into how the universe started with the Big Bang, but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered (see [[Quantum gravity]]). Recent evidence suggests that this scenario is not likely but it has not been ruled out as measurements are only available over a short period of time and could reverse in the future.<ref name=\"astro-ph/0409264\"/>\n\nThis scenario allows the Big Bang to occur immediately after the Big Crunch of a preceding universe. If this happens repeatedly, it creates a [[cyclic model]], which is also known as an oscillatory universe. The universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes, with each finite universe ending with a Big Crunch that is also the Big Bang of the next universe. Theoretically, the cyclic universe could not{{vague|could not = \"might not\" or \"cannot\"?|date=January 2019}} be reconciled with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: entropy would build up from oscillation to oscillation and cause [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]. Current evidence also indicates the universe is not [[shape of the universe|closed]]. This has caused cosmologists to abandon the oscillating universe model. A somewhat similar idea is embraced by the [[cyclic model]], but this idea evades [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]] because of an expansion of the [[brane]]s that dilutes entropy accumulated in the previous cycle.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Big Bounce===\n{{Main|Big Bounce}}\n\nThe [[Big Bounce]] is a theorized scientific model related to the beginning of the known universe. It derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the Big Bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe.\n\nAccording to one version of the Big Bang theory of cosmology, in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense. Such a description seems to be at odds with other more widely accepted theories, especially quantum mechanics and its [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It is not surprising, therefore, that quantum mechanics has given rise to an alternative version of the Big Bang theory. Also, if the universe is closed, this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the Big Bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion.\n\nIn simple terms, this theory states that the universe will continuously repeat the cycle of a Big Bang, followed up with a Big Crunch.\n\n===Big Slurp===\n{{Main|False vacuum}}\n\nThis theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment.\n\nIn order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory, one must first understand the Higgs field which permeates the universe. Much like an electromagnetic field, it varies in strength based upon its potential. A true vacuum exists so long as the universe exists in its lowest energy state, in which case the false vacuum theory is irrelevant. However, if the vacuum is not in its lowest energy state (a [[false vacuum]]), it could [[quantum tunnelling|tunnel]] into a lower energy state.<ref name=\"fate\">\n* {{cite journal | author = M.

Many wider US and Swedish [[freeway]]s have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median as well as at the outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions (see below).\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of building a shoulder is that in the event of an emergency or [[Breakdown (vehicle)|breakdown]], a motorist can pull into the shoulder to get out of the flow of traffic and obtain a greater degree of safety.\n==Other uses==\nShoulders also have multiple other uses, including:\n* [[Emergency vehicle]]s such as [[ambulance]]s, [[fire truck]]s and [[police car]]s may use the shoulder to bypass [[traffic congestion]].\n* [[Active traffic management]], used on busy multi-lane roads, may allow 'hard shoulder running' by general traffic at reduced speeds during periods of high traffic volumes.\n* In some places a \"bus bypass shoulder\" may be provided which allows bus services to pass stationary traffic.\n* Paved shoulders provide additional space should a motorist need to take evasive action (such as avoiding a [[wrong-way driving|wrong-way driver]]) or need to recover control of their vehicle before a [[run-off-road collision]] occurs.\n* In some rural areas without [[sidewalks]], pedestrians and cyclists may be allowed to walk or ride on the shoulders.\n* On curbed roadways, shoulders move the gutter away from the travel lanes which reduces the risk of [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]], and reduces splash and spray of [[stormwater]] onto pedestrians using any adjacent sidewalk.\n* Paved shoulders move water away from the roadway before it can infiltrate into the road's [[subbase (pavement)|subbase]], increasing the life expectancy of the road surface.\n* Shoulders help provide extra structural support of the roadway.\n* When semi-truck drivers need sleep and there are no available parking spaces at truck stops and rest areas, either because there are no such facilities nearby or because all semi-truck parking spaces are filled to capacity, drivers may pull over to the highway shoulder and sleep in their truck cabin.\n* In some countries, parking in the shoulder isn't prohibited by the law, and mushroom and berry pickers commonly use them on roads going through a forest.\n\n==General characteristics==\n[[File:N11 road south of Newtownmountkennedy.jpg|thumb|In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], dashed yellow lines demarcate hard shoulders on non-[[motorways]], as can be seen along this [[dual carriageway]] on the [[N11 road (Ireland)|N11]].]]\nThe shoulder is usually slightly narrower than a full traffic lane. In some cases, particularly on older rural roadways, shoulders that initially existed were hardened with [[gravel]] rather than being paved with [[asphalt]] or [[concrete]]. In Britain, motorway shoulders are now paved, but are still known as 'hard shoulders.' Older, gravel shoulders have sometimes been termed '''soft shoulders''' by comparison. Because the paved surface ends at that point, they are less safe if they need to be used for emergency maneuvers. Notably, the section of [[Ontario Highway 401]] between Windsor and London had soft shoulders with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers, if drivers accidentally drifted off the paved section of the road and then overreacted after hitting the gravel. Modern practice is to build a continuous paved shoulder whenever possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-58343268/carnage-alley-ontario-highway.html|title=Apps - Access My Library - Gale|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312123153/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-58343268/carnage-alley-ontario-highway.html|archivedate=2012-03-12}}</ref>\n\nThe US [[Federal Highway Administration]] encourages the placement of a ''Safety Edge'' \u2014 a 30\u00b0 compacted taper on the end of the pavement dropoff \u2014 to ensure that any driver running off the edge of the roadway is better able to maintain control while trying to steer back onto the roadway. The Safety Edge is effective on roads where the shoulder is narrow or nonexistent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/safetyedge/intro.cfm | title = Safety Edge Introduction - Every Day Counts | accessdate = 2013-01-22 | author = Federal Highway Administration | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130108134702/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/safetyedge/intro.cfm | archivedate = 2013-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nTo save money, the shoulder was often not paved to the same thickness as the through lanes, so if vehicles were to attempt to use it as a through lane regularly, it would rapidly deteriorate. In Britain, shoulder running can occur during roadworks, and full depth construction is now standard. In some metro areas, road authorities also allow shoulders to be used as lanes at peak periods. However, rural shoulders often collects various bits of [[road debris]] that can make driving there less safe.\n\nDrivers will sometimes drift into the shoulder when being overtaken by passing vehicles, particularly on two-lane roads. However, it is extremely unsafe, and in most jurisdictions illegal, to abuse the shoulder by 'undertaking' passing vehicles that are nearer the center of the road.\n\nOn older roads, the shoulder may disappear for short periods, near exits or when going across or under [[bridge]]s or tunnels where the cost savings were thought to outweigh the safety benefits of the shoulder. Some roads have a narrow shoulder for significant distances. This makes it difficult for large vehicles to pull into the hard shoulder altogether.\n\nThe [[Jingjintang Expressway]] in northeastern [[China]] is an example of this phenomenon. Its shoulder is only {{convert|2.4|m|ft|1}} wide, which is not wide enough for some automobiles\u2014a standard lane in the U.S. and UK is {{convert|12|ft|m|1}}. As a result, some motorists are unable to fully exit the mainline when they need to pull over, so they end up in a position that is halfway in the rightmost lane and only partly on the shoulder. The end result is often a traffic jam and occasionally a collision.\n\n==Bus bypass shoulder==\nIn some jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, [[bus]]es are allowed to drive on the shoulder to pass traffic jams, which is called a bus-only shoulder or bus-bypass shoulder (BBS);<ref>{{cite web   | title = A shoulder to drive on   | publisher = Traffic Technology Today   | url = http://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/opinion.php?BlogID=109   | accessdate = 2013-04-01   | url-status = live   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144859/http://traffictechnologytoday.com/opinion.php?BlogID=109   | archivedate = 2013-01-21   }}</ref> the term \"bus-only shoulder lane\" is incorrect from a technical and legal standpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/teamtransit/docs/bosupdate.pdf|title=Bus-Only Shoulders (Minnesota Department of Transportation)|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410063743/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/teamtransit/docs/bosupdate.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:BusOnShoulder.jpg|thumb|Bus bypassing traffic in Minneapolis|245x245px]]\nIn [[Ontario]], [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]] had its shoulders between Hurontario Street and Erin Mills Parkway widened in 2003 so they serve a dual-purpose as bus lanes and accident lanes.

RS7:Safety of Vulnerable Road Users, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, August 1998</ref>\n\nThe use of appropriately designed segregated space on arterial or interurban routes appears to be associated with reductions in overall risk. In [[Ireland]], the provision of hard shoulders on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The bicycle, a study of efficiency usage and safety., D.F.

Their provision of on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents involving pedal cyclists.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe hard shoulder is usually demarcated by road markings in the form of a single dashed yellow line with the addition of yellow [[Cat's eye (road)|cat's eye]]s. On motorways, and at critical points on other routes (e.g. between junctions or interchanges, or beneath overpasses) a solid yellow line is used, denoting additional restrictions on usage of the hard shoulder. At junctions and on-ramps and off-ramps, the yellow line peels away into the turn, with a dashed white line (with green cats' eyes) denoting a lane division following the main route (i.e. in most cases the road remains the same width, and a turn lane takes the place of the hard shoulder).\n\nIn the 2000s, Bus \u00c9ireann coaches were allowed to use the hard shoulders on national roads into Dublin. However, dedicated bus lanes are now present on sections of some routes, such as the [[N7 road (Ireland)|N7]] ''Naas Road'', and such use of actual hard shoulder is not universal.\n\n===Canada and United States===\n[[File:California shoulder break.jpg|thumb|right|A break in the shoulder line is used by California to warn of upcoming freeway exits in foggy areas]]\nThe right-hand shoulder is separated by a solid white line, and the left-hand shoulder (if the road is one-way, such as part of a [[divided highway]]) is separated from the leftmost through lane by a solid yellow line. On many roads, the lines are supplemented by reflective [[raised pavement marker]]s or [[rumble strip]]s placed every few feet in order to provide additional visual and tactile feedback to drivers crossing the lines.\n\nNormally, driving in the shoulder lane is forbidden, but in the case of traffic blockage in some jurisdictions, use of the shoulder may be allowed for the purpose of reaching an exit if the exit is within {{convert|200|ft}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nOn [[freeway]]s in [[fog]]gy areas of [[California]], there is an obvious break in the line of the shoulder before every exit; this is to help drivers find their exits in heavy fog (especially the dangerous [[tule fog]]).\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:A2 at Leyton Cross - geograph.org.uk - 203101.jpg|right|thumb| [[A2 road (England)|A2]] at Leyton Cross, United Kingdom.]]\nFull width hard shoulders are usually provided only on [[motorway]]s and are usually {{convert|3.3|m}} wide, but there are exceptions. Some motorways do not have hard shoulders at all (for example the [[A57(M) motorway|A57(M)]] and many [[Smart motorway|smart motorways]] where the hard shoulder has been converted into a running lane) and there are a small number of [[dual carriageway]] A-roads which do possess hard shoulders (for example, parts of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], [[A2 road (England)|A2]] and [[A27 road|A27]]). Hard shoulders are always marked with a reflectorized solid white line which is {{convert|20|cm}} wide and is provided with a [[rumble strip]].

The main difference from other European countries is that the white line is dashed, typically {{convert|39|m}} long with gaps {{convert|13|m}} long. The design is intended to provide a guide for drivers to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. Road signs can be found along motorways, to indicate the safe distance (1 line = too close, 2 lines = safe distance). At some points (tunnel, bridge, narrow road with no shoulder, tight curve) the edge line becomes solid.   \n\n===Australia===\nIn a similar manner to Canada, Italy and the United States, as described above, the shoulders located on the side of Australia's highways are normally used as an emergency lane in the case of a breakdown or by emergency vehicles in the case of road congestion.

Many wider US and Swedish [[freeway]]s have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median as well as at the outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions (see below).\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of building a shoulder is that in the event of an emergency or [[Breakdown (vehicle)|breakdown]], a motorist can pull into the shoulder to get out of the flow of traffic and obtain a greater degree of safety.\n==Other uses==\nShoulders also have multiple other uses, including:\n* [[Emergency vehicle]]s such as [[ambulance]]s, [[fire truck]]s and [[police car]]s may use the shoulder to bypass [[traffic congestion]].\n* [[Active traffic management]], used on busy multi-lane roads, may allow 'hard shoulder running' by general traffic at reduced speeds during periods of high traffic volumes.\n* In some places a \"bus bypass shoulder\" may be provided which allows bus services to pass stationary traffic.\n* Paved shoulders provide additional space should a motorist need to take evasive action (such as avoiding a [[wrong-way driving|wrong-way driver]]) or need to recover control of their vehicle before a [[run-off-road collision]] occurs.\n* In some rural areas without [[sidewalks]], pedestrians and cyclists may be allowed to walk or ride on the shoulders.\n* On curbed roadways, shoulders move the gutter away from the travel lanes which reduces the risk of [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]], and reduces splash and spray of [[stormwater]] onto pedestrians using any adjacent sidewalk.\n* Paved shoulders move water away from the roadway before it can infiltrate into the road's [[subbase (pavement)|subbase]], increasing the life expectancy of the road surface.\n* Shoulders help provide extra structural support of the roadway.\n* When semi-truck drivers need sleep and there are no available parking spaces at truck stops and rest areas, either because there are no such facilities nearby or because all semi-truck parking spaces are filled to capacity, drivers may pull over to the highway shoulder and sleep in their truck cabin.\n* In some countries, parking in the shoulder isn't prohibited by the law, and mushroom and berry pickers commonly use them on roads going through a forest.\n\n==General characteristics==\n[[File:N11 road south of Newtownmountkennedy.jpg|thumb|In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], dashed yellow lines demarcate hard shoulders on non-[[motorways]], as can be seen along this [[dual carriageway]] on the [[N11 road (Ireland)|N11]].]]\nThe shoulder is usually slightly narrower than a full traffic lane. In some cases, particularly on older rural roadways, shoulders that initially existed were hardened with [[gravel]] rather than being paved with [[asphalt]] or [[concrete]]. In Britain, motorway shoulders are now paved, but are still known as 'hard shoulders.' Older, gravel shoulders have sometimes been termed '''soft shoulders''' by comparison. Because the paved surface ends at that point, they are less safe if they need to be used for emergency maneuvers. Notably, the section of [[Ontario Highway 401]] between Windsor and London had soft shoulders with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers, if drivers accidentally drifted off the paved section of the road and then overreacted after hitting the gravel. Modern practice is to build a continuous paved shoulder whenever possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-58343268/carnage-alley-ontario-highway.html|title=Apps - Access My Library - Gale|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312123153/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-58343268/carnage-alley-ontario-highway.html|archivedate=2012-03-12}}</ref>\n\nThe US [[Federal Highway Administration]] encourages the placement of a ''Safety Edge'' \u2014 a 30\u00b0 compacted taper on the end of the pavement dropoff \u2014 to ensure that any driver running off the edge of the roadway is better able to maintain control while trying to steer back onto the roadway. The Safety Edge is effective on roads where the shoulder is narrow or nonexistent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/safetyedge/intro.cfm | title = Safety Edge Introduction - Every Day Counts | accessdate = 2013-01-22 | author = Federal Highway Administration | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130108134702/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/safetyedge/intro.cfm | archivedate = 2013-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nTo save money, the shoulder was often not paved to the same thickness as the through lanes, so if vehicles were to attempt to use it as a through lane regularly, it would rapidly deteriorate. In Britain, shoulder running can occur during roadworks, and full depth construction is now standard. In some metro areas, road authorities also allow shoulders to be used as lanes at peak periods. However, rural shoulders often collects various bits of [[road debris]] that can make driving there less safe.\n\nDrivers will sometimes drift into the shoulder when being overtaken by passing vehicles, particularly on two-lane roads. However, it is extremely unsafe, and in most jurisdictions illegal, to abuse the shoulder by 'undertaking' passing vehicles that are nearer the center of the road.\n\nOn older roads, the shoulder may disappear for short periods, near exits or when going across or under [[bridge]]s or tunnels where the cost savings were thought to outweigh the safety benefits of the shoulder. Some roads have a narrow shoulder for significant distances. This makes it difficult for large vehicles to pull into the hard shoulder altogether.\n\nThe [[Jingjintang Expressway]] in northeastern [[China]] is an example of this phenomenon. Its shoulder is only {{convert|2.4|m|ft|1}} wide, which is not wide enough for some automobiles\u2014a standard lane in the U.S. and UK is {{convert|12|ft|m|1}}. As a result, some motorists are unable to fully exit the mainline when they need to pull over, so they end up in a position that is halfway in the rightmost lane and only partly on the shoulder. The end result is often a traffic jam and occasionally a collision.\n\n==Bus bypass shoulder==\nIn some jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, [[bus]]es are allowed to drive on the shoulder to pass traffic jams, which is called a bus-only shoulder or bus-bypass shoulder (BBS);<ref>{{cite web   | title = A shoulder to drive on   | publisher = Traffic Technology Today   | url = http://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/opinion.php?BlogID=109   | accessdate = 2013-04-01   | url-status = live   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144859/http://traffictechnologytoday.com/opinion.php?BlogID=109   | archivedate = 2013-01-21   }}</ref> the term \"bus-only shoulder lane\" is incorrect from a technical and legal standpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/teamtransit/docs/bosupdate.pdf|title=Bus-Only Shoulders (Minnesota Department of Transportation)|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410063743/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/teamtransit/docs/bosupdate.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:BusOnShoulder.jpg|thumb|Bus bypassing traffic in Minneapolis|245x245px]]\nIn [[Ontario]], [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]] had its shoulders between Hurontario Street and Erin Mills Parkway widened in 2003 so they serve a dual-purpose as bus lanes and accident lanes.

On motorways, and at critical points on other routes (e.g. between junctions or interchanges, or beneath overpasses) a solid yellow line is used, denoting additional restrictions on usage of the hard shoulder. At junctions and on-ramps and off-ramps, the yellow line peels away into the turn, with a dashed white line (with green cats' eyes) denoting a lane division following the main route (i.e. in most cases the road remains the same width, and a turn lane takes the place of the hard shoulder).\n\nIn the 2000s, Bus \u00c9ireann coaches were allowed to use the hard shoulders on national roads into Dublin. However, dedicated bus lanes are now present on sections of some routes, such as the [[N7 road (Ireland)|N7]] ''Naas Road'', and such use of actual hard shoulder is not universal.\n\n===Canada and United States===\n[[File:California shoulder break.jpg|thumb|right|A break in the shoulder line is used by California to warn of upcoming freeway exits in foggy areas]]\nThe right-hand shoulder is separated by a solid white line, and the left-hand shoulder (if the road is one-way, such as part of a [[divided highway]]) is separated from the leftmost through lane by a solid yellow line. On many roads, the lines are supplemented by reflective [[raised pavement marker]]s or [[rumble strip]]s placed every few feet in order to provide additional visual and tactile feedback to drivers crossing the lines.\n\nNormally, driving in the shoulder lane is forbidden, but in the case of traffic blockage in some jurisdictions, use of the shoulder may be allowed for the purpose of reaching an exit if the exit is within {{convert|200|ft}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nOn [[freeway]]s in [[fog]]gy areas of [[California]], there is an obvious break in the line of the shoulder before every exit; this is to help drivers find their exits in heavy fog (especially the dangerous [[tule fog]]).\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:A2 at Leyton Cross - geograph.org.uk - 203101.jpg|right|thumb| [[A2 road (England)|A2]] at Leyton Cross, United Kingdom.]]\nFull width hard shoulders are usually provided only on [[motorway]]s and are usually {{convert|3.3|m}} wide, but there are exceptions. Some motorways do not have hard shoulders at all (for example the [[A57(M) motorway|A57(M)]] and many [[Smart motorway|smart motorways]] where the hard shoulder has been converted into a running lane) and there are a small number of [[dual carriageway]] A-roads which do possess hard shoulders (for example, parts of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], [[A2 road (England)|A2]] and [[A27 road|A27]]). Hard shoulders are always marked with a reflectorized solid white line which is {{convert|20|cm}} wide and is provided with a [[rumble strip]]. A line of red [[Cat's eye (road)|cats' eyes]] is also used, and is placed to the side of the line.\n\nOn many modern non-motorway roads, a ''hard strip'' is provided. These are usually {{convert|1|m}} wide, and are bounded by thinner solid white lines, and often without a rumble strip.\n\n===Italy===\nThe shoulders located on the sides of [[Italy]]'s highways are normally used as emergency lanes in case of breakdown or by emergency vehicles in case of queues. According to the regulation in force, it is mandatory to wear a [[high visibility jacket]] when dismounting from a vehicle stopped in an emergency lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/D.Lgs._30_aprile_1992%2C_n._285._Nuovo_codice_della_strada/Titolo_V#art._162._Segnalazione_di_veicolo_fermo|title=Art 162 Codice della Strada|accessdate=2007-06-12 |format= |website= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606082232/http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/D.Lgs._30_aprile_1992,_n._285._Nuovo_codice_della_strada/Titolo_V#art._162._Segnalazione_di_veicolo_fermo <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-06}}</ref>\n\nNormally one is not allowed to drive on the shoulder, but in case of traffic blockage, use of the shoulder is allowed to reach an exit if the exit is within 500 meters.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Autoroute distance de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 SR2a.jpg|thumb|French highway, with dashed shoulder markings and sign explaining their significance]]\nIn France, roadway shoulders are usually {{convert|2.5|m}} wide, or {{convert|3|m}} wide when the roadway carries more than 2000 vehicles/day. The main difference from other European countries is that the white line is dashed, typically {{convert|39|m}} long with gaps {{convert|13|m}} long. The design is intended to provide a guide for drivers to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. Road signs can be found along motorways, to indicate the safe distance (1 line = too close, 2 lines = safe distance). At some points (tunnel, bridge, narrow road with no shoulder, tight curve) the edge line becomes solid.   \n\n===Australia===\nIn a similar manner to Canada, Italy and the United States, as described above, the shoulders located on the side of Australia's highways are normally used as an emergency lane in the case of a breakdown or by emergency vehicles in the case of road congestion. However, no mandatory regulations exist to wear a [[high visibility jacket]] when dismounting from the vehicle stopped in an emergency lane.\n\nA recent study conducted by the National Coroners Information System (NCIS) in Australia <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncis.org.au/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221192843/http://ncis.org.au/|url-status=dead|title= National Coroners Information System, NCIS - Home|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> has revealed 29 closed case fatalities (and at least a dozen case fatalities still under coronial investigation) that had been reported to Australian coroners where a person was \"struck in an emergency lane after their vehicle had stopped\" between July 2000 and November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncis.org.au/web_pages/FACT-SHEET%20-%20Deaths%20in%20emergency%20lanes%20-%20final.pdf|title=Deaths in Emergency Lanes - National Coroners Information System (NCIS) Fact-Sheet, January 2011|website=ncis.org.au|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121055208/http://www.ncis.org.au/web_pages/FACT-SHEET%20-%20Deaths%20in%20emergency%20lanes%20-%20final.pdf|archivedate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bus lane]]\n* [[Rumble strip]]\n* [[Wide outside lane]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://membres.lycos.fr/fmalard/panneaux/en_DDE.html Traffic Signs about Shoulders]\n*[http://www.ncis.org.au/web_pages/FACT-SHEET%20-%20Deaths%20in%20emergency%20lanes%20-%20final.pdf Deaths in Emergency Lanes - National Coroners Information System (NCIS) Fact-Sheet, January 2011]\n\n{{Road types}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shoulder (Road)}}\n[[Category:Road transport]]\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n\n[[de:Stra\u00dfenquerschnitt#Seitenstreifen]]\n", "name_user": "Rckania", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBus bypass shoulder:Added info about Pace", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_(road)"}
