Many swear they have seen a beautiful woman and a sad crocodile on the riverbank and that the two share a mysterious empathy.\n\n;Part 1\u2014Paradise Lost\nThree disparate women dwell in an old building in [[Lisbon]]. Aurora, an octogenarian living off her pension, eccentric, talkative and superstitious, seeming more dead than alive, and Santa, her housemaid from [[Cape Verde]], live at the same apartment. Santa is semi-literate, but proficient in the divinatory art of [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]. Pilar, their neighbor and friend, a Catholic middle-aged woman, and militant social benefactor, involves herself in their psychodramas.\n\nPilar has another friend, a romantic painter in love, a gentleman who insists on offering her tacky pieces of art. But Pilar is more concerned with Aurora: with Aurora's solitude, with her frequent escapes to the casino. She is even more worried about Santa, with her long silences and devil arts. Santa thinks it better to take care of oneself without annoying others, so keeps quiet.\n\nSomething else concerns the old lady: understanding she will die soon, she feels someone is missing her, someone her friends have never heard about: Gian-Luca Ventura. So she asks Pilar to find him. She succeeds in doing so and the man appears. He is an old colonist, a disturbed man, from [[Mozambique]], a former Portuguese colony. Another story emerges, beginning: \"Aurora had a farm in Africa at the foothill of Mount Tabu...\"\n\n;Part 2\u2014Paradise\n[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]: The story of Aurora's life, told by Gian-Luca Ventura in [[voice over]]. This part takes place shortly before the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] began.<ref>[http://europeanfilmawards.eu/en_EN/film/919 Tabu] \u2013 Reference at  [http://europeanfilmawards.eu European Film Awards]</ref>\n\nIn 1960s Portuguese Africa, Aurora and her husband live together near the Tabu Mountain. She is a skilled hunter, never missing a shot. She owns a small crocodile, a gift from her husband, which moves around the house as a pet.\n\nOne day, the animal runs away. The pregnant Aurora finds it in Ventura's house, where they consummate their existing mutual attraction; a passionate and dangerous love affair ensues. Gian-Luca confides in his friend, Mario, about the affair. Mario demands that Gian-Luca end the affair and when he is ignored, the two start fighting. The heavily pregnant Aurora picks up a revolver and shoots and kills Mario. She later gives birth to a girl. Two days later, Gian-Luca leaves Africa for good.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Teresa Madruga]] as Pilar\n* [[Laura Soveral]] as Old Aurora\n* [[Ana Moreira]] as Young Aurora\n* Henrique Esp\u00edrito Santo as Old Ventura \n* [[Carloto Cotta]] as Young Ventura\n* Isabel Mu\u00f1oz Cardoso as Santa\n* [[Ivo M\u00fcller]] as Aurora's Husband \n* Manuel Mesquita as M\u00e1rio\n* [[Miguel Gomes (director)|Miguel Gomes]] as Narrator\n\n== Reception ==\n''Tabu'' is the Portuguese film with the widest international distribution as of 2012 and the fifth from Portugal to be commercially released in New York ([[Film Forum]], December 2012),<ref>[http://www.filmforum.org/movies/more/tabu1 Tabu at the Film Forum]</ref> after ''[[The Art of Amalia]]'' by [[Bruno de Almeida]] (2000, [[Quad Cinema]]), ''[[O Fantasma]]'' by [[Jo\u00e3o Pedro Rodrigues]] (2003, [[IFC Center]]) and, in 2011, ''[[The Strange Case of Angelica]]'' by [[Manoel de Oliveira]] (IFC Center) and ''Mists'' by Ricardo Costa ([[Quad Cinema]]).\n\n===Critical reception===\nCritic [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded ''Tabu'' four of five stars, and called the film \"a gem: gentle, eccentric, possessed of a distinctive sort of innocence\u2014and also charming and funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Tabu \u2013 review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/06/tabu-review|date=6 September 2012|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> But in his review of ''Tabu'', ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[A. O.

Many swear they have seen a beautiful woman and a sad crocodile on the riverbank and that the two share a mysterious empathy.\n\n;Part 1\u2014Paradise Lost\nThree disparate women dwell in an old building in [[Lisbon]]. Aurora, an octogenarian living off her pension, eccentric, talkative and superstitious, seeming more dead than alive, and Santa, her housemaid from [[Cape Verde]], live at the same apartment. Santa is semi-literate, but proficient in the divinatory art of [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]. Pilar, their neighbor and friend, a Catholic middle-aged woman, and militant social benefactor, involves herself in their psychodramas.\n\nPilar has another friend, a romantic painter in love, a gentleman who insists on offering her tacky pieces of art. But Pilar is more concerned with Aurora: with Aurora's solitude, with her frequent escapes to the casino. She is even more worried about Santa, with her long silences and devil arts. Santa thinks it better to take care of oneself without annoying others, so keeps quiet.\n\nSomething else concerns the old lady: understanding she will die soon, she feels someone is missing her, someone her friends have never heard about: Gian-Luca Ventura. So she asks Pilar to find him. She succeeds in doing so and the man appears. He is an old colonist, a disturbed man, from [[Mozambique]], a former Portuguese colony. Another story emerges, beginning: \"Aurora had a farm in Africa at the foothill of Mount Tabu...\"\n\n;Part 2\u2014Paradise\n[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]: The story of Aurora's life, told by Gian-Luca Ventura in [[voice over]]. This part takes place shortly before the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] began.<ref>[http://europeanfilmawards.eu/en_EN/film/919 Tabu] \u2013 Reference at  [http://europeanfilmawards.eu European Film Awards]</ref>\n\nIn 1960s Portuguese Africa, Aurora and her husband live together near the Tabu Mountain. She is a skilled hunter, never missing a shot. She owns a small crocodile, a gift from her husband, which moves around the house as a pet.\n\nOne day, the animal runs away. The pregnant Aurora finds it in Ventura's house, where they consummate their existing mutual attraction; a passionate and dangerous love affair ensues. Gian-Luca confides in his friend, Mario, about the affair. Mario demands that Gian-Luca end the affair and when he is ignored, the two start fighting. The heavily pregnant Aurora picks up a revolver and shoots and kills Mario. She later gives birth to a girl. Two days later, Gian-Luca leaves Africa for good.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Teresa Madruga]] as Pilar\n* [[Laura Soveral]] as Old Aurora\n* [[Ana Moreira]] as Young Aurora\n* Henrique Esp\u00edrito Santo as Old Ventura \n* [[Carloto Cotta]] as Young Ventura\n* Isabel Mu\u00f1oz Cardoso as Santa\n* [[Ivo M\u00fcller]] as Aurora's Husband \n* Manuel Mesquita as M\u00e1rio\n* [[Miguel Gomes (director)|Miguel Gomes]] as Narrator\n\n== Reception ==\n''Tabu'' is the Portuguese film with the widest international distribution as of 2012 and the fifth from Portugal to be commercially released in New York ([[Film Forum]], December 2012),<ref>[http://www.filmforum.org/movies/more/tabu1 Tabu at the Film Forum]</ref> after ''[[The Art of Amalia]]'' by [[Bruno de Almeida]] (2000, [[Quad Cinema]]), ''[[O Fantasma]]'' by [[Jo\u00e3o Pedro Rodrigues]] (2003, [[IFC Center]]) and, in 2011, ''[[The Strange Case of Angelica]]'' by [[Manoel de Oliveira]] (IFC Center) and ''Mists'' by Ricardo Costa ([[Quad Cinema]]).\n\n===Critical reception===\nCritic [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded ''Tabu'' four of five stars, and called the film \"a gem: gentle, eccentric, possessed of a distinctive sort of innocence\u2014and also charming and funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Tabu \u2013 review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/06/tabu-review|date=6 September 2012|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> But in his review of ''Tabu'', ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[A.
