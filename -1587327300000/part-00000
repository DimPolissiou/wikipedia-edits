It was used as an [[anti-tank gun]] on its own carriage, as well as equipping a number of British tanks. Used with the [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] shot, it was capable of defeating all but the thickest [[vehicle armour|armour]] on German tanks. It was used to 'up-gun' some foreign-built vehicles in British service, notably to produce the [[Sherman Firefly]] variant of the US M4 Sherman tank, giving British tank units the ability to hold their own against their German counterparts. In the anti-tank role, it was replaced after the war by the [[120 mm BAT recoilless rifle]]. As a tank gun, it was succeeded by the 84&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]].\n\n==Development history==\n===Gun development===\n[[File:A British 'Pheasant' 17-pdr anti-tank gun in action on the Medenine front in Tunisia, 11 March 1943. NA1076.jpg|left|thumb|'Pheasant' 17-pdr anti-tank gun in action at the [[Battle of Medenine]], [[Tunisia]], 11 March 1943]]\n\nBefore the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder]] had entered service, the British predicted that it would soon be inadequate given the increasing armour of German tanks. In late 1940, the design of a replacement began, and was largely completed by the end of 1941. A prototype production line was set up in spring 1942, and with the appearance of [[Tiger I]] tanks in early 1943 in the [[North African Campaign]], the first 100 prototype 17-pounder anti-tank guns were quickly sent to help counter this new threat. So great was the rush that they were sent before proper carriages had been developed, and the guns had to be mounted in the carriages of [[25-pounder]] gun-[[howitzer]]s. These early weapons were known as '''17/25-pounders''' and given the codename ''Pheasant''. They first saw action in February 1943.\n\nFully developed 17-pounders started production in 1943 and were first used during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. They became one of the most effective weapons on the battlefield, on both carriages and tanks.\n\nThe 17-pounder anti-tank guns also saw action in Korea against tanks and in general support use against bunker positions. After Korea, the gun was largely replaced in the tank role by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder]], and in the anti-tank role by the BAT, MOBAT and [[L6 Wombat|120&nbsp;mm L6 WOMBAT]] series of [[recoilless rifle]]s.\n\n===Adaptation into tanks and AFVs===\n[[File:SouthAfricanFirefly1.png|thumb|right|A [[Sherman Firefly]] with the 17-pounder, [[South African National Museum of Military History]], 2014]]\nThe 17-pounder outperformed all other Allied armour-piercing guns, and was quickly adapted for use on various tank chassis. However, few tanks were capable of carrying such a large gun due to the size limitations of their turret rings. A new British tank specification, A29, was produced to meet the need for a 17-pounder armed [[cruiser tank]]. While the A29 was eventually cancelled without a successful design being produced, an amended specification, A30, reached production in 1943. The A30 specification reduced weight and enabled the use of [[Cromwell tank]] components as a design expedient. The resulting [[Cruiser Mark VIII Challenger]] had a longer hull and provided a larger turret, allowing the 17-pounder to be mounted along with space for a second loader, thought to be required for the gun's larger ammunition. However, production of the tank took time and few could be completed before the allied invasion of Normandy.\n\nWhile developing the Challenger tank, the British devised a conversion for their US-supplied [[M4 Sherman]] tanks to mount the 17-pounder. This was applied in sufficient numbers to put them into service in time for [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] as the [[Sherman Firefly]]. The gun, was a modified design that was produced specifically for the Firefly. The breech of the gun was rotated 90 degrees to fit inside of the height of the turret, i.e. it lay on its side. An additional box was welded to the back of the turret to take the radio, which was moved to allow for the breech and its recoil.<ref group= note>Being a long gun, in order to give a satisfactory balance, more of the gun was mounted inside the turret</ref> Additionally, a new recoil mechanism, based on that of the 6-pounder was developed to further shorten the recoil, while also shortening the gun cradle.<ref>{{YouTube|id=__Y8YJeas4I|title=Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: Sherman VC \"Firefly\" part 2}}</ref> Production of the Challenger was cancelled, and more Shermans were converted until about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.\n\n[[File:M10 Achilles facing forward.jpg|thumb|17-pounder SP Achilles of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]].]]\n\nThe British also converted some of their US-produced [[M10 Wolverine|M10 tank destroyers]], replacing the 3-inch (76&nbsp;mm) gun with the 17-pounder; the resulting vehicles were called [[17pdr SP Achilles]] or just ''17-pdr M10C''. These served with [[Royal Artillery]] as self-propelled guns.\n\nThe 17-pounder was also successfully trialled on the Australian-designed [[Sentinel tank]], though no Sentinels equipped with this gun entered service with the [[Australian Army]].\n\nA variant of the 17-pounder, the 77mm HV, was used on the [[Comet (tank)|Comet]] tank. A separate weapon, this fired 17-pounder projectiles in a more tank-compatible form, and ultimately replaced the need for 17-pounder tanks late in the war.\n\nAs the war came to a close, the 17-pounder was also deployed on the [[Centurion tank]], until ultimately being replaced by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]].\n\nThe United States Army did not use the 17-pounder, though the gun was offered to US forces with a number of Sherman tanks modified for testing.<ref>{{citation |first=Mark |last=Hayward |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/shermanic.firefly/usnew.html |title=Sherman M4 and M4A3 17 pounder in US service New Information |date=19 September 2002|url-status=dead |archivedate =16 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916193941/http://freespace.virgin.net/shermanic.firefly/usnew.html |work=Shermanic Firefly}}</ref> US tanks began to use the [[76 mm gun M1]] instead.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Frein de bouche Ordnance QF 17 pounder.jpg|thumb|[[Muzzle brake]] Ordnance QF 17 pounder]]\n\n[[File:QF 17 pounder Burlington Ontario 2013 3.jpg|thumb|Rear view of QF 17-pounder displayed in Burlington, Ontario]]\n;Mark I\n: first production versions.\n;Mark II\n: intended for tank use.

It was intended to fire the US 75&nbsp;mm projectiles (AP shot and HE) at a higher velocity, avoiding a downgrade in armour penetration versus the 6-pounder, which the dual purpose 75mm was replacing.\n\nThe new 50-calibre long gun, known as the '''Vickers HV 75&nbsp;mm''', fired a 75mm projectile attached to a necked down [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) 20 cwt AA gun]] cartridge through a modified breech. The larger 3\" cartridge provided a greater propellant charge compared with normal 75mm shells. Although the 75&nbsp;mm HV was a promising weapon, it proved to be too big for the [[Cromwell tank]], which was ultimately fitted with the normal QF 75&nbsp;mm gun in use on other British tanks. To account for this difference, tank squadrons were teamed with [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger]] and [[Sherman Firefly]] tanks armed with the 17-pounder.\n\nWhen the Cromwell's replacement, the [[Comet tank|Comet]], was at the design stage, the 75&nbsp;mm HV concept was reworked to fire the same projectiles as the 17-pounder through a shortened 17-pounder barrel, but retaining the 3-inch cartridge case firing from a standard 3-inch breech.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/alt%20WW2%20tank%20gun.htm |title=An alternative 1930s tank gun |last=Williams, Anthony G |year=2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123006/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/alt%20WW2%20tank%20gun.htm |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis has the benefit of greater ease of use on tanks, many of which would not have sufficient turret space to accommodate the breech length and recoil distance of the 17-pounder.

As a result, it had to be towed by a [[gun tractor]], such as the [[Morris C8|Morris Quad]], [[M3 Half-track]] or the [[Crusader tank#Crusader II Gun Tractor Mk I|Crusader]], as it could not effectively be moved by its gun crew alone, especially on poor ground. After firing on soft ground, the 17-pounder frequently had to be pulled out of the ground due to the gun recoil burying the trail spades. After the Second World War, it was issued to anti-tank units of the Royal Artillery in the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) towed by the M3 Half Track. When the Royal Artillery anti-tank units were disbanded in 1951, it was transferred to Infantry battalions in the BAOR (six per battalion), towed by the [[Oxford Tracked Carrier]]. It was later replaced by the [[120 mm BAT recoilless rifle]] anti-tank weapon.\n[[File:17 pounder shellfortnelson.jpg|thumb|upright|The complete [[Armour Piercing|AP]] round of a 17-pounder]]\n\n====Pheasant carriage====\nAlso known by the 17/25 pounder designation, a stop-gap measure named ''Pheasant'' mated the 17 pounder gun with a modified 25 pounder carriage.

It was used as an [[anti-tank gun]] on its own carriage, as well as equipping a number of British tanks. Used with the [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] shot, it was capable of defeating all but the thickest [[vehicle armour|armour]] on German tanks. It was used to 'up-gun' some foreign-built vehicles in British service, notably to produce the [[Sherman Firefly]] variant of the US M4 Sherman tank, giving British tank units the ability to hold their own against their German counterparts. In the anti-tank role, it was replaced after the war by the [[120 mm BAT recoilless rifle]]. As a tank gun, it was succeeded by the 84&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]].\n\n==Development history==\n===Gun development===\n[[File:A British 'Pheasant' 17-pdr anti-tank gun in action on the Medenine front in Tunisia, 11 March 1943. NA1076.jpg|left|thumb|'Pheasant' 17-pdr anti-tank gun in action at the [[Battle of Medenine]], [[Tunisia]], 11 March 1943]]\n\nBefore the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder]] had entered service, the British predicted that it would soon be inadequate given the increasing armour of German tanks. In late 1940, the design of a replacement began, and was largely completed by the end of 1941. A prototype production line was set up in spring 1942, and with the appearance of [[Tiger I]] tanks in early 1943 in the [[North African Campaign]], the first 100 prototype 17-pounder anti-tank guns were quickly sent to help counter this new threat. So great was the rush that they were sent before proper carriages had been developed, and the guns had to be mounted in the carriages of [[25-pounder]] gun-[[howitzer]]s. These early weapons were known as '''17/25-pounders''' and given the codename ''Pheasant''. They first saw action in February 1943.\n\nFully developed 17-pounders started production in 1943 and were first used during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. They became one of the most effective weapons on the battlefield, on both carriages and tanks.\n\nThe 17-pounder anti-tank guns also saw action in Korea against tanks and in general support use against bunker positions. After Korea, the gun was largely replaced in the tank role by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder]], and in the anti-tank role by the BAT, MOBAT and [[L6 Wombat|120&nbsp;mm L6 WOMBAT]] series of [[recoilless rifle]]s.\n\n===Adaptation into tanks and AFVs===\n[[File:SouthAfricanFirefly1.png|thumb|right|A [[Sherman Firefly]] with the 17-pounder, [[South African National Museum of Military History]], 2014]]\nThe 17-pounder outperformed all other Allied armour-piercing guns, and was quickly adapted for use on various tank chassis. However, few tanks were capable of carrying such a large gun due to the size limitations of their turret rings. A new British tank specification, A29, was produced to meet the need for a 17-pounder armed [[cruiser tank]]. While the A29 was eventually cancelled without a successful design being produced, an amended specification, A30, reached production in 1943. The A30 specification reduced weight and enabled the use of [[Cromwell tank]] components as a design expedient. The resulting [[Cruiser Mark VIII Challenger]] had a longer hull and provided a larger turret, allowing the 17-pounder to be mounted along with space for a second loader, thought to be required for the gun's larger ammunition. However, production of the tank took time and few could be completed before the allied invasion of Normandy.\n\nWhile developing the Challenger tank, the British devised a conversion for their US-supplied [[M4 Sherman]] tanks to mount the 17-pounder. This was applied in sufficient numbers to put them into service in time for [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] as the [[Sherman Firefly]]. The gun, was a modified design that was produced specifically for the Firefly. The breech of the gun was rotated 90 degrees to fit inside of the height of the turret, i.e. it lay on its side. An additional box was welded to the back of the turret to take the radio, which was moved to allow for the breech and its recoil.<ref group= note>Being a long gun, in order to give a satisfactory balance, more of the gun was mounted inside the turret</ref> Additionally, a new recoil mechanism, based on that of the 6-pounder was developed to further shorten the recoil, while also shortening the gun cradle.<ref>{{YouTube|id=__Y8YJeas4I|title=Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: Sherman VC \"Firefly\" part 2}}</ref> Production of the Challenger was cancelled, and more Shermans were converted until about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.\n\n[[File:M10 Achilles facing forward.jpg|thumb|17-pounder SP Achilles of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]].]]\n\nThe British also converted some of their US-produced [[M10 Wolverine|M10 tank destroyers]], replacing the 3-inch (76&nbsp;mm) gun with the 17-pounder; the resulting vehicles were called [[17pdr SP Achilles]] or just ''17-pdr M10C''. These served with [[Royal Artillery]] as self-propelled guns.\n\nThe 17-pounder was also successfully trialled on the Australian-designed [[Sentinel tank]], though no Sentinels equipped with this gun entered service with the [[Australian Army]].\n\nA variant of the 17-pounder, the 77mm HV, was used on the [[Comet (tank)|Comet]] tank. A separate weapon, this fired 17-pounder projectiles in a more tank-compatible form, and ultimately replaced the need for 17-pounder tanks late in the war.\n\nAs the war came to a close, the 17-pounder was also deployed on the [[Centurion tank]], until ultimately being replaced by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]].\n\nThe United States Army did not use the 17-pounder, though the gun was offered to US forces with a number of Sherman tanks modified for testing.<ref>{{citation |first=Mark |last=Hayward |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/shermanic.firefly/usnew.html |title=Sherman M4 and M4A3 17 pounder in US service New Information |date=19 September 2002|url-status=dead |archivedate =16 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916193941/http://freespace.virgin.net/shermanic.firefly/usnew.html |work=Shermanic Firefly}}</ref> US tanks began to use the [[76 mm gun M1]] instead.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Frein de bouche Ordnance QF 17 pounder.jpg|thumb|[[Muzzle brake]] Ordnance QF 17 pounder]]\n\n[[File:QF 17 pounder Burlington Ontario 2013 3.jpg|thumb|Rear view of QF 17-pounder displayed in Burlington, Ontario]]\n;Mark I\n: first production versions.\n;Mark II\n: intended for tank use.

It was intended to fire the US 75&nbsp;mm projectiles (AP shot and HE) at a higher velocity, avoiding a downgrade in armour penetration versus the 6-pounder, which the dual purpose 75mm was replacing.\n\nThe new 50-calibre long gun, known as the '''Vickers HV 75&nbsp;mm''', fired a 75mm projectile attached to a necked down [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) 20 cwt AA gun]] cartridge through a modified breech. The larger 3\" cartridge provided a greater propellant charge compared with normal 75mm shells. Although the 75&nbsp;mm HV was a promising weapon, it proved to be too big for the [[Cromwell tank]], which was ultimately fitted with the normal QF 75&nbsp;mm gun in use on other British tanks. To account for this difference, tank squadrons were teamed with [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Challenger]] and [[Sherman Firefly]] tanks armed with the 17-pounder.\n\nWhen the Cromwell's replacement, the [[Comet tank|Comet]], was at the design stage, the 75&nbsp;mm HV concept was reworked to fire the same projectiles as the 17-pounder through a shortened 17-pounder barrel, but retaining the 3-inch cartridge case firing from a standard 3-inch breech.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/alt%20WW2%20tank%20gun.htm |title=An alternative 1930s tank gun |last=Williams, Anthony G |year=2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123006/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/alt%20WW2%20tank%20gun.htm |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis has the benefit of greater ease of use on tanks, many of which would not have sufficient turret space to accommodate the breech length and recoil distance of the 17-pounder. Similarly, the smaller 3\" based ammunition was easier to store and handle in the tank's cramped interior.\n\nThis new gun's ammunition was not interchangeable with the 17-pounder, however, and to prevent confusion over ammunition supplies, it was renamed the '''77&nbsp;mm HV'''\u2014the 'HV' standing for ''High Velocity''\u2014although it was the same 76.2&nbsp;mm calibre as the 17-pounder.\n\n==Ammunition==\n[[File:The British Army in the Normandy Campaign 1944 B6056.jpg|thumb|right|17-pounder gun, three loaders standing by with AP ammunition during [[Operation Epsom]], 27 June 1944.]]\n[[File:17-pdr-8829.jpg|thumb|complete 17pdr Armour-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (APDS) shot and tungsten carbide core side by side]]\n\nThe 17-pounder the following ammunition types:\n;Armour Piercing Capped (APC)\n:[[Armor-piercing shell|Armour Piercing Capped]] was a basic AP shell used with field guns, but was not used when the 17pdr was mounted in the Sherman Firefly tank.{{sfnp|Fletcher|2008|p=29}}\n;Armour Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC)\n:[[APCBC|Armour Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped]] ammunition could penetrate 163&nbsp;mm of armour at 500 metres and 150&nbsp;mm at 1000&nbsp;m.\n;Armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS)\n:[[Armour-piercing discarding sabot]] could penetrate 256&nbsp;mm of armour at 500&nbsp;m and 233&nbsp;mm at 1000&nbsp;m,{{sfnp|Bird|Livingston|2001|p=60}}<ref group=note>A [[Bovington Tank Museum]] document{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} states the 17-Pounder Mk II firing APDS could penetrate 187&nbsp;mm at 500 yards with a 30\u00b0 angle of obliquity, while ''Jane's Armour and Artillery 1981-82'' gives a penetration of 231&nbsp;mm at 1,000 yards with the same strike angle.</ref> and allowing it in theory to penetrate the armour of even the German [[Tiger II]] heavy tank.

As a result, it had to be towed by a [[gun tractor]], such as the [[Morris C8|Morris Quad]], [[M3 Half-track]] or the [[Crusader tank#Crusader II Gun Tractor Mk I|Crusader]], as it could not effectively be moved by its gun crew alone, especially on poor ground. After firing on soft ground, the 17-pounder frequently had to be pulled out of the ground due to the gun recoil burying the trail spades. After the Second World War, it was issued to anti-tank units of the Royal Artillery in the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) towed by the M3 Half Track. When the Royal Artillery anti-tank units were disbanded in 1951, it was transferred to Infantry battalions in the BAOR (six per battalion), towed by the [[Oxford Tracked Carrier]].

In the process of its own organisation , the Cadiz Carnival takes on peculiarities of Italian, explicable by the fundamentally Genoese influence that C\u00e1diz knew since the fifteenth century. After the Turks' displacement to the Mediterranean, Italian merchants moved to the West, finding C\u00e1diz a place of settlement perfectly communicated with the commercial objectives that the Genoese were looking for: the north and center of Africa. The masks, the serpentines, the confetti are assimilated from the Italian carnival.<br>\n=== 16th century ===\nThe first documentary references to the celebration of the carnival are from historian [[w:es:Agust\u00edn de Horozco|Agust\u00edn de Horozco]]. At the end of the 16th century,  during carnival time, the inhabitants of Cadiz plucked the flowers from the pots to throw them at each other as a joke. Other documents that record the celebration of the carnivals are the Synod Constitutions of 1591 and the Statutes of the Seminary of C\u00e1diz in 1596, both contain indications so that the religious did not participate in the festivities in a way that the seculars did. These references, about the Carnival, confirm that already at the end of the 16th century, the festivities should have deep roots among the people of Cadiz.<ref>Agust\u00edn de Orozco (1845)  Historia de la ciudad de C\u00e1diz: Imprenta de don Manuel Bosch, 1845. Hay ed. moderna de Arturo Morgado Garc\u00eda, 2001.</ref>\n=== 17th century ===\nThere are also references from the seventeenth century. A document of 1636 recognizes the impotence of the civil power against the popular celebration. A letter from General Mencos dated in C\u00e1diz on February 7, 1652, complains that the Cadiz workers refused to repair their boat because they were in Carnestolendas. There is also evidence of the events that took place in 1678, the year in which the cleric Nicol\u00e1s Aznar was accused of having adulterous relations with Antonia Gil Morena, whom he had met during the carnival.<ref>Cuadrado, U., & Barbosa, F. (1999). El Carnaval de C\u00e1diz. Or\u00edgenes y evoluci\u00f3n: Siglos XVI-XIX.</ref>\n=== 18th century to 20th century===\nBeginning the 18th century, the orders are repeated frequently, trying to banish the Carnival. In 1716 masked dances were prohibited by the Crown, prohibitions that were repeated throughout this century. In spite of everything, there are testimonies that confirm the disrespect of the orders was quite remarkable. In the carnival of 1776, excesses were committed in the convent of Santa Mar\u00eda and in that of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria, which caused scandals in the city. This same year, the British traveler [[Henry Swinburne]] visited the city, who left testimony about the Carnival celebrations of the people of Cadiz.<ref> Swinburne, H. (1787) [http://www.bibliotecavirtualdeandalucia.es/catalogo/es/consulta/registro.cmd?id=6067 \"Travels through Spain in the years 1775 and 1776\"] Biblioteca Virtual de Andaluc\u00eda, online consultation 14 March, 2018</ref> \n\nThese festivities were celebrated even during the French invasion. However, there was a time during which the celebration was suspended: on February 5, 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Battle of the Ebro]], the prohibition to celebrate any type of carnival in Spain was published in the \u201cBolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado\u201d.<ref> [https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1937/108/A00321-00321.pdf Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado] (BOE), February 5, 1937.</ref> <br>\n\nIt was not until 1947 when the tradition was recovered, a fact that occurred as a result, paradoxically, of a disgrace: [[C\u00e1diz Explosion|the explosion of the San Severiano storage depot]], who caused some 200 victims in the city. The civil governor, Carlos Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez de Valc\u00e1rcel, decided then that it was necessary to raise the spirits and was recovered the festive spirit In the organisation of the Carnival.<ref>[https://www.muyhistoria.es/contemporanea/articulo/el-carnaval-de-cadiz-prohibido-durante-la-guerra-civil-421454602354 \"El carnaval de C\u00e1diz prohibido durante la Guerra Civil\"]</ref>\n\n==Musical groups== \nThe most famous groups are the ''chirigotas'', the choirs, and the ''[[comparsa]]s''.\n\nThe '''comparsas''' are well-known witty and satiric groups that train for the whole year to sing about politics, topics in the news, and everyday circumstances, while all of the members wear identical costumes. There is an official competition in Teatro Falla, where many of them compete for a group award. Their songs are all original compositions and are full of satire and wit. Each ''comparsa'' \u2013 whether a professional group or one made up of family members, friends or colleagues \u2013 has a wide repertoire of songs. They sing in the streets and squares, at improvised venues like outdoor staircases or portals, and in established open-air ''tablaos'' (''tableaux'') organized by the carnival clubs.\n\nThe '''chirigotas''' are the groups of people (like the comparsas) that sharing a costume and singing together, performed a full repertoire of songs about current topics but with in a humoristic way, unlike the comparsas. The chirigotas\u00b4 tunes are happier as well as their lyrics even though they can address the same subjects as the comparsas. They also compete in the Teatro Falla for the awards.\n\nThe '''choirs''' (''coros'') are larger groups that travel through the streets on open flat-bed carts or wagons, singing, with a small ''ensemble'' of [[guitar]]s and [[lute]]s. Their characteristic composition is the \"Carnival Tango\", and they alternate between comical and serious repertory, with special emphasis on lyrical homages to the city and its people. The costumes are, by far, the most sophisticated and elaborate of all.\n\n[\nOther groups can be found in the streets: the '''quartets''' (''cuartetos''), that, oddly, can be composed of five, four, or three members. They do not bring a guitar, only a [[kazoo]] and two sticks, that they use to mark the rhythm. They use set-piece theater scenes (pre-written skits), improvisations, and music, and they are purely comical.\n\nThe minimalist carnival groups in C\u00e1diz are the '''romanceros''', perhaps the oldest, and, certainly, the most invariant carnival representation in C\u00e1diz throughout history. A ''romancero'' is a single costumed person who brings a big easel on which posters help him to tell a story with images. The ''romancero'' recites humorous verses while pointing at aspects of the pictures and drawings with a long stick.\n[[Image:Carnavaldecadiz.jpg|330px|thumb|right|A choir singing at the Carnival of C\u00e1diz]]\n\n==Musical forms==\nSpecific musical forms have evolved at the Carnival of C\u00e1diz over the years.  In the beginning, popular music was used, and tropical rhythms were mixed with popular European dances and songs; only the lyrics changed. Near the end of the nineteenth century, the musical identity of the Carnival was already mature, and, although most of the names ([[tango music|tango]], [[pasodoble]], couplet, etc.) are shared with other musical forms around the world, their melodies, rhythms, and character are unmistakably original.\n\n*The '''''Presentation''''' is the first piece sung to present the characterisation of the group, called its ''tipo''. The style of the music is absolutely free and unstructured.  It can take the form of a well-known form, an original composition, or even a spoken-word recitation.\n*The '''''Couplet''''' is sung by the ''chirigotas'', ''comparsas'', choirs, and quartets. They are short satirical songs with a refrain that is always related to the costume and the characterisation (''tipo'') of the group.\n*The '''''Pasodoble''''' is a longer song without a refrain, and it is usually (but not always) serious, criticising something that happened during the previous year or rendering an ''homage'' to someone. They are sung by the comparsas and the chirigotas.\n[[Image:Gran Teatro Falla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Gran Teatro Falla]], the venue for the main contest of chirigotas, choirs and comparsas during the twenty days before the Carnival.]]\n\n*The '''''Tango''''', with its characteristic ''gaditano'' rhythm is sung only by the choirs, accompanied by their orchestras, and they are mostly poetical compositions.\n*The '''''Potpourri''''', sung by all of the groups, changing the lyrics of well-known songs of the year or any other kind of music, sometimes depending on the group's ''tipo''.\n\nBeside these, other musical forms, including short improvisations and theatrical skits are featured, mostly by the so-called ''illegal chirigotas'', ''murgas'', or ''callejeras'', that don't submit to any rule or contest.  They just roam the streets singing and performing as they wish.\n\n==The contests==\nThe best known contest among ''chirigotas'', choirs, ''comparsas'', and quartets in C\u00e1diz is the ''''''Official Contest'''''' at the ''Gran Teatro Falla'', that finishes just before the first Saturday of Carnival. It is broadcast by the regional television and radio stations. Other contests take place before, during, and after the Carnival, usually organized by institutions and private clubs, and their venues are open ''tablaos'' in the public squares (''plazas'') of the city.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.carnavaldecadiz.com Main portal about Carnival of C\u00e1diz] {{in lang|es}}\n*[http://www.tertuliaandaluza.com/sociedad/actualidad/carnaval-de-cadiz/?lang=en Carnival of Cadiz in Tertulia Andaluza]\n\n{{Commons category|Carnival of C\u00e1diz}}\n{{Culture of Andalusia}}\n{{Carnival around the world}}\n\n{{coord missing|Spain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carnival of Cadiz}}\n[[Category:C\u00e1diz]]\n[[Category:Carnivals in Spain]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Andalusia]]\n[[Category:January observances]]\n[[Category:February observances]]\n[[Category:Winter events in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:CarnavalCadiz1926.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster advertising the 1926 Carnival of C\u00e1diz]]\nThe '''Carnival of C\u00e1diz''' ({{Lang-es|Carnaval de C\u00e1diz}}) is one of the best-known carnivals in [[Spain]].

They are sung by the comparsas and the chirigotas.\n[[Image:Gran Teatro Falla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Gran Teatro Falla]], the venue for the main contest of chirigotas, choirs and comparsas during the twenty days before the Carnival.]]\n\n*The '''''Tango''''', with its characteristic ''gaditano'' rhythm is sung only by the choirs, accompanied by their orchestras, and they are mostly poetical compositions.\n*The '''''Potpourri''''', sung by all of the groups, changing the lyrics of well-known songs of the year or any other kind of music, sometimes depending on the group's ''tipo''.\n\nBeside these, other musical forms, including short improvisations and theatrical skits are featured, mostly by the so-called ''illegal chirigotas'', ''murgas'', or ''callejeras'', that don't submit to any rule or contest.

A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C.

\u0412\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; 3 October 1939 \u2013 4 March 2002) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]], also one of the legendary players of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] and one of greatest [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] of his generation. A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C.
