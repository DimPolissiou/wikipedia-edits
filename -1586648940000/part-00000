The flesh varies in colour, juiciness, texture and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable, while others taste considerably better than the majority of commercial cultivars.<ref name=Morton /><ref name=\"PONC1999\" />\n\nThe most commonly sold kiwifruit is derived from ''[[Actinidia deliciosa|A.&nbsp;deliciosa]]'' (fuzzy kiwifruit).

Where fuzzy kiwifruit (''A. deliciosa'') is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Kiwifruit-Actinidia deliciosa-plantation.jpg|thumb|Kiwifruit growing on supported vine]]\nOften in commercial farming, different breeds are used for [[rootstock]], fruit bearing plants and [[pollinators]].<ref name=Morton /> Therefore, the seeds produced are [[crossbreed]]s of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

Their fruits are quite variable, although most are easily recognised as kiwifruit because of their appearance and shape. The skin of the fruit varies in size, hairiness and colour. The flesh varies in colour, juiciness, texture and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable, while others taste considerably better than the majority of commercial cultivars.<ref name=Morton /><ref name=\"PONC1999\" />\n\nThe most commonly sold kiwifruit is derived from ''[[Actinidia deliciosa|A.&nbsp;deliciosa]]'' (fuzzy kiwifruit).

Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

He was born in [[Croft, Leicestershire|Croft]], [[Leicestershire]], England.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b7bab241-2a80-47dc-b8e0-c1334a0b5abb&Language=E&Section=ALL | title=DUNNING, The Hon. Charles Avery, P.C. | publisher=www.parl.gc.ca | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKnown throughout his life as \"Charlie\", Dunning, a 17-year-old iron worker, followed a friend's advice and traveled to [[Canada]] to work as a farm hand. Satisfied that a permanent move to Canada made sense, he convinced the remainder of his family to come to east central Saskatchewan. Dunning filed for a homestead in the Beaverdale district, west of [[Yorkton]].\n\n==Early business career==\nDuring his short career as a farmer, Dunning was involved in the local of the [[Territorial Grain Growers' Association]], an early proponent of a farmer-owned cooperative grain marketing system. At his first general meeting of the Association, Dunning's enthusiasm was apparent, and he was promptly elected as a director. The following year, he was elected as vice-president of the Association.\n\nA co-operative marketing system required physical assets. The Association convinced the Saskatchewan government to assist by incorporating the [[Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company]],<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/charles-avery-dunning | title=Charles Avery Dunning | author=\tJ. William Brennan | publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 }}</ref>  and provide it with limited financial backing. Dunning was appointed a provisional director of a Board that had only a few months to raise the necessary capital to build a line of rural grain elevators. At age 25, the youngest man on the Board, Dunning watched as each one of his seniors turned down the critical job of organizing the capital campaign. Dunning took the job and succeeded. The following year, in 1911, he was rewarded for his efforts by being named the first general manager of the Company. Four years later, it was the largest grain handling company in the world. As manager, Dunning was instrumental in developing a provincial hail insurance scheme, which survives today as Saskatchewan Municipal Hail Insurance.\n\n==Enters provincial politics==\nDunning's interests turned to politics. The Liberal government of [[Thomas Walter Scott|Walter Scott]], Saskatchewan's first premier, was tainted with allegations of corruption. Traditional politics were being challenged, as farmer's movements had become politically active, creating political parties throughout Canada.\n\nDunning first ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] as a Liberal in a by-election held in the [[Kinistino (Saskatchewan provincial electoral district)|Kinistino]] constituency in 1916. Unopposed, he was acclaimed a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]]. During his time in provincial politics, Dunning persuaded the farmer's movement in Saskatchewan to support the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. During the 1920s, Dunning was able to maintain support for both the federal and provincial parties at a time when farmers elsewhere switched their support to the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] and the [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]].\n\nEntering the government of [[List of premiers of Saskatchewan|Premier]] [[William Melville Martin|William M. Martin]] (another outsider brought in to \"clean up\" the reputation of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party), Dunning became [[Provincial Treasurer]], a post he held continuously for his ten years as an MLA.\n\nIn the [[1917 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1917]], Dunning won a contested race for the seat of [[Moose Jaw County]] by obtaining twice the votes of his opponent. He remained the member for Moose Jaw County for the remainder of his time in provincial politics. Dunning ran unopposed in the [[1921 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1921]], and won a contested race in the [[1925 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1925]] by a 2.5 to 1 margin.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1922, Charles Dunning held a series of [[Executive Council of Saskatchewan|Cabinet posts]], which included appointments as [[Provincial Secretary]] and Provincial Treasurer, and as the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Saskatchewan)|Minister of Agriculture]], Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Railways, and [[SaskTel|Minister of Telephones]]. In 1922, at age 37, he became Premier.\n\nDunning's government ended [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] after a 1924 [[plebiscite]], but sought to continue regulation through [[Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority|government-owned and operated liquor stores]]. His last official act as Premier was to arrange for the sale of the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company to the [[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool]] for $11 million (the equivalent in 2005 would be $130 million).\n\n[[Image:Charles Dunning Land Grant.jpg|left|thumb|220px|The Original Crown Grant for the Dunning Homestead]]\n\n==Federal cabinet minister==\nIn 1926, Dunning was courted by Federal Liberals, to join the minority government of [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. He won the seat of [[Regina (electoral district)|Regina]] by acclamation in a by-election held in March, and was immediately appointed to [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]] as Minister of Railways and Canals.\n\nBy June, King was no longer able to govern, as a result of political scandal and the withdrawal of support by the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]. King went to [[Governor General]] [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng of Vimy]] asking Byng to dissolve [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] and call a general election. Byng refused, relying on the reserve power invested in him by the Imperial Government. Instead he asked [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] Leader, [[Arthur Meighen]] to form a government. Dunning was now in opposition.\n\nThe matter continued over the summer. King took the position that Byng's refusal was unwarranted Imperial interference in Canadian affairs. King's grievance with the Governor General gained momentum when Meighen refused to swear in his cabinet, and instead appointed \"acting ministers\", pending a delayed vote of confidence. While this ongoing drama played out (the [[King-Byng Affair]]), there was doubt in Liberal ranks about King's viability as leader. A movement began to take shape among leading Liberals to draft Dunning as a replacement.\n\nBy September, King had convinced the Progressives to support him in a non-confidence vote. The Conservatives lost and the Liberals won the ensuing general election. King (and the leaders of the other [[Dominion]]s) won recognition of autonomous status from the Imperial government (the [[Balfour Declaration, 1926|Balfour Declaration of 1926]]) followed by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Doubts about King's status ended.\n\nDunning had won a contested race by 900 votes, and had again appointed to the same cabinet portfolio, but the relationship was never easy thereafter. King regarded Dunning as a threat.\n\nDuring his time as Minister of Railways and Canals, Dunning was a staunch supporter of Sir [[Henry Thornton (railroader)|Henry Thornton]], the U.S.-born Englishman who, in 1922 had taken over the presidency of the [[Canadian National Railways]]. In that portfolio, Dunning established himself as a friend of the Western farmer. \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dunning League of Nations.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Canada at the League of Nations, 1928. Left to right: [[O.D. Skelton]], [[Philippe Roy]], Senator [[Raoul Dandurand]], W.L. Mackenzie King, Charles Dunning and [[Walter Riddell]]]] -->\nDecisions made during his tenure included his accession to a petition from area farmers to have the Canadian National Railways build a branch line through his old home of [[Beaver Dale, Saskatchewan|Beaver Dale]] to [[Parkerview, Saskatchewan]]. He also settled a longstanding debate by choosing [[Churchill, Manitoba]] as the terminus of the Hudson Bay Railway. Upon completion of the railway and port facilities in 1931, Churchill became the closest Canadian port to [[Liverpool]]. The shipping route to Churchill was 1,600 kilometres shorter than the old overland route to [[Montreal]].\n\n==Minister of Finance==\nStill a young man, at age 44, Dunning became [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] in 1929. As in his previous portfolio, Dunning earned a reputation for hard work and fairness. It was said that it was typical of Dunning that, although feeling ill, he remained on his feet throughout the reading and passage of his first set of estimates as Minister of Finance. As soon as the estimates were passed, Dunning collapsed and was rushed to the hospital to be treated for appendicitis.\n\nDunning was not only interested in domestic politics. He was also keenly interested in international politics, and particularly, in Canada's relationship with his \"old country\", the United Kingdom. Dunning participated in Canada's delegation to the [[League of Nations]].\n\nIn 1930, when the United States proposed the draconian Smoot-Hawley tariff, Canada's response was the Dunning tariff with increased duties and further tariff preference for the United Kingdom. The tariff was challenged by the opposition on the basis that the imperial preference was prejudicial to Canadian interests.\n\n==Defeated, returns to business==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dunningleg.jpg|left|thumb|190px| Premier's Portrait of Dunning Housed in the Legislative Gallery, Legislature of Saskatchewan]] -->Several months later, in the 1930 General Election, [[R.B. Bennett]] wrested power from King (notwithstanding Bennett's views while in opposition, the Dunning tariff remained in effect until renegotiated in the late 1930s). Dunning lost his Regina seat by over 3,500 votes (obtaining only two-thirds of the winner's total). Safe Liberal seats were offered to Dunning, but he turned them down, thinking that a business career would protect his family's financial future. He restarted his business career reorganizing an under-performing subsidiary of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], thereafter establishing a reputation as a brilliant re-organizer of insolvent companies.\n\n==Return to politics==\nKing regained power in the 1935 general election. He immediately went to Dunning, pressing him to re-enter polities. King convinced Dunning that he was needed in the tough economic times created by the [[Great Depression]], a sitting Member of Parliament stepped aside, and Dunning was yet again acclaimed in a 1936 by-election held in the constituency of [[Queen's (Prince Edward Island electoral district)|Queen's]] in [[Prince Edward Island]]. Dunning returned to the Finance portfolio. This time, one of Dunning's legacies was the establishment of the Central Mortgage Bank, today the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]].\n\n==Business executive==\nIn ill health, Dunning left politics in 1939, relocating to [[Montreal]]. In 1940, he was appointed as president and CEO of Ogilvie Flour Mills, a position he held until 1947, when he was appointed chairman of the board. In addition to his Board duties with Ogilvie, Dunning continued his business of corporate reorganization. He sat on a number of prestigious corporate and bank boards, including that of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\n==Chancellor of Queen's University==\nIn 1940, Dunning was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Queen's University, Kingston|Queen's University]], and became [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the university. Dunning's abilities earned him the gratitude of the university, which named Dunning Hall (School of Economics) in his honour. The Chancellor Dunning Trust Lectureship was established by an anonymous donor, to \"promote the understanding and appreciation of the supreme importance of the dignity, freedom, and responsibility of the individual person in human society\". More recently, the university has established the Stauffer-Dunning Chair in Public Policy.\n\n[[File:Funeral plaque Charles Avery Dunning.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque about Dunning in [[Mount Royal Cemetery]].]]\n==Later life, honours==\nOther universities which granted honorary doctorates to Dunning included [[McGill University]] in 1939 and the [[University of Saskatchewan]], in 1946. Dunning died in 1958 in Montreal. He was 74 years old.\n\nIn 2005, as part of Saskatchewan's centennial celebration, Dunning's memory was commemorated in two ways. First, the Provincial Revenue Building was renamed Dunning Place. (The Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company had its offices in the building when Dunning was General Manager). The choice is particularly appropriate, given Dunning's long tenure as Provincial Treasurer. \nSecond, on the initiative of Saskatchewan's [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Gordon Barnhart|Dr. Gordon Barnhart]], Dunning's gravesite, in Montreal's Mount Royal Cemetery, was commemorated by a bronze plaque, recognizing Dunning's contribution to the people of Saskatchewan.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Canadian Parliament links|ID=13007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817192235/http://cyr.gov.sk.ca/assets/pdf/WebsiteComplete.pdf Saskatchewan Government Booklet - Gravesites of Saskatchewan Premiers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050106091319/http://wascanapark.tripod.com/monuments/dunning.html Dunning Monument - Speaker's Corner]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050825214807/http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/History/bldgs/dunn.html Queen's University, Dunning and Dunning Hall ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080316040646/http://www.sahf.ca/profile.php?id=34 Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame]\n*[http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20030826.html CBC - article on Chretien/Martin tension - reference to King and Dunning]\n*[http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20030417.html CBC - integrity in politics (mention of Dunning)]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{succession box\n| before=[[James Armstrong Richardson, Sr.]]\n| title=[[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]\n| years=1940\u20131958\n| after=[[John Bertram Stirling]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{SKPremiers}}\n{{Saskatchewan Liberal Party leaders}}\n{{CanMinFinance}}\n{{CA-Ministers of Transport}}\n{{Principals and Chancellors of Queen's University}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunning, Charles}}\n[[Category:1885 births]]\n[[Category:1958 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canadian farmers]]\n[[Category:Canadian Ministers of Finance]]\n[[Category:Canadian Ministers of Railways and Canals]]\n[[Category:Chancellors of Queen's University]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Prince Edward Island]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]]\n[[Category:Members of the United Church of Canada]]\n[[Category:People from Blaby District]]\n[[Category:Premiers of Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)]]\n[[Category:Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLAs]]\n[[Category:Leaders of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the New Zealand rugby league international|Charles Dunning (rugby league)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix = \n| name             = Charles Avery Dunning\n| honorific-suffix = \n| image            = People-Dunning.jpg\n| imagesize        = \n| office           = 3rd [[Premier of Saskatchewan]]\n| predecessor      = [[William Melville Martin]]\n| successor        = [[James Garfield Gardiner]]\n| monarch          = [[George V]]\n| lieutenant_governor = [[Henry William Newlands]]\n| term_start       = April 5, 1922\n| term_end         = February 26, 1926\n| office2          = Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] for [[Kinistino (Saskatchewan provincial electoral district)|Kinistino]]\n| term_start2      = November 13, 1916\n| term_end2        = June 26, 1917\n| predecessor2     = [[Edward Haywood Devline|Edward Devline]]\n| successor2       = [[John Richard Parish Taylor|John Richard P.

He was born in [[Croft, Leicestershire|Croft]], [[Leicestershire]], England.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b7bab241-2a80-47dc-b8e0-c1334a0b5abb&Language=E&Section=ALL | title=DUNNING, The Hon. Charles Avery, P.C. | publisher=www.parl.gc.ca | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKnown throughout his life as \"Charlie\", Dunning, a 17-year-old iron worker, followed a friend's advice and traveled to [[Canada]] to work as a farm hand. Satisfied that a permanent move to Canada made sense, he convinced the remainder of his family to come to east central Saskatchewan. Dunning filed for a homestead in the Beaverdale district, west of [[Yorkton]].\n\n==Early business career==\nDuring his short career as a farmer, Dunning was involved in the local of the [[Territorial Grain Growers' Association]], an early proponent of a farmer-owned cooperative grain marketing system. At his first general meeting of the Association, Dunning's enthusiasm was apparent, and he was promptly elected as a director. The following year, he was elected as vice-president of the Association.\n\nA co-operative marketing system required physical assets. The Association convinced the Saskatchewan government to assist by incorporating the [[Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company]],<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/charles-avery-dunning | title=Charles Avery Dunning | author=\tJ. William Brennan | publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 }}</ref>  and provide it with limited financial backing. Dunning was appointed a provisional director of a Board that had only a few months to raise the necessary capital to build a line of rural grain elevators. At age 25, the youngest man on the Board, Dunning watched as each one of his seniors turned down the critical job of organizing the capital campaign. Dunning took the job and succeeded. The following year, in 1911, he was rewarded for his efforts by being named the first general manager of the Company. Four years later, it was the largest grain handling company in the world. As manager, Dunning was instrumental in developing a provincial hail insurance scheme, which survives today as Saskatchewan Municipal Hail Insurance.\n\n==Enters provincial politics==\nDunning's interests turned to politics. The Liberal government of [[Thomas Walter Scott|Walter Scott]], Saskatchewan's first premier, was tainted with allegations of corruption. Traditional politics were being challenged, as farmer's movements had become politically active, creating political parties throughout Canada.\n\nDunning first ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] as a Liberal in a by-election held in the [[Kinistino (Saskatchewan provincial electoral district)|Kinistino]] constituency in 1916. Unopposed, he was acclaimed a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]]. During his time in provincial politics, Dunning persuaded the farmer's movement in Saskatchewan to support the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. During the 1920s, Dunning was able to maintain support for both the federal and provincial parties at a time when farmers elsewhere switched their support to the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] and the [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]].\n\nEntering the government of [[List of premiers of Saskatchewan|Premier]] [[William Melville Martin|William M. Martin]] (another outsider brought in to \"clean up\" the reputation of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party), Dunning became [[Provincial Treasurer]], a post he held continuously for his ten years as an MLA.\n\nIn the [[1917 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1917]], Dunning won a contested race for the seat of [[Moose Jaw County]] by obtaining twice the votes of his opponent. He remained the member for Moose Jaw County for the remainder of his time in provincial politics. Dunning ran unopposed in the [[1921 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1921]], and won a contested race in the [[1925 Saskatchewan general election|general election of 1925]] by a 2.5 to 1 margin.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1922, Charles Dunning held a series of [[Executive Council of Saskatchewan|Cabinet posts]], which included appointments as [[Provincial Secretary]] and Provincial Treasurer, and as the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Saskatchewan)|Minister of Agriculture]], Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Railways, and [[SaskTel|Minister of Telephones]]. In 1922, at age 37, he became Premier.\n\nDunning's government ended [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] after a 1924 [[plebiscite]], but sought to continue regulation through [[Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority|government-owned and operated liquor stores]]. His last official act as Premier was to arrange for the sale of the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company to the [[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool]] for $11 million (the equivalent in 2005 would be $130 million).\n\n[[Image:Charles Dunning Land Grant.jpg|left|thumb|220px|The Original Crown Grant for the Dunning Homestead]]\n\n==Federal cabinet minister==\nIn 1926, Dunning was courted by Federal Liberals, to join the minority government of [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. He won the seat of [[Regina (electoral district)|Regina]] by acclamation in a by-election held in March, and was immediately appointed to [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]] as Minister of Railways and Canals.\n\nBy June, King was no longer able to govern, as a result of political scandal and the withdrawal of support by the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]. King went to [[Governor General]] [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng of Vimy]] asking Byng to dissolve [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] and call a general election. Byng refused, relying on the reserve power invested in him by the Imperial Government. Instead he asked [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] Leader, [[Arthur Meighen]] to form a government. Dunning was now in opposition.\n\nThe matter continued over the summer. King took the position that Byng's refusal was unwarranted Imperial interference in Canadian affairs. King's grievance with the Governor General gained momentum when Meighen refused to swear in his cabinet, and instead appointed \"acting ministers\", pending a delayed vote of confidence. While this ongoing drama played out (the [[King-Byng Affair]]), there was doubt in Liberal ranks about King's viability as leader. A movement began to take shape among leading Liberals to draft Dunning as a replacement.\n\nBy September, King had convinced the Progressives to support him in a non-confidence vote. The Conservatives lost and the Liberals won the ensuing general election. King (and the leaders of the other [[Dominion]]s) won recognition of autonomous status from the Imperial government (the [[Balfour Declaration, 1926|Balfour Declaration of 1926]]) followed by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Doubts about King's status ended.\n\nDunning had won a contested race by 900 votes, and had again appointed to the same cabinet portfolio, but the relationship was never easy thereafter. King regarded Dunning as a threat.\n\nDuring his time as Minister of Railways and Canals, Dunning was a staunch supporter of Sir [[Henry Thornton (railroader)|Henry Thornton]], the U.S.-born Englishman who, in 1922 had taken over the presidency of the [[Canadian National Railways]]. In that portfolio, Dunning established himself as a friend of the Western farmer. \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dunning League of Nations.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Canada at the League of Nations, 1928. Left to right: [[O.D. Skelton]], [[Philippe Roy]], Senator [[Raoul Dandurand]], W.L. Mackenzie King, Charles Dunning and [[Walter Riddell]]]] -->\nDecisions made during his tenure included his accession to a petition from area farmers to have the Canadian National Railways build a branch line through his old home of [[Beaver Dale, Saskatchewan|Beaver Dale]] to [[Parkerview, Saskatchewan]]. He also settled a longstanding debate by choosing [[Churchill, Manitoba]] as the terminus of the Hudson Bay Railway. Upon completion of the railway and port facilities in 1931, Churchill became the closest Canadian port to [[Liverpool]]. The shipping route to Churchill was 1,600 kilometres shorter than the old overland route to [[Montreal]].\n\n==Minister of Finance==\nStill a young man, at age 44, Dunning became [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] in 1929. As in his previous portfolio, Dunning earned a reputation for hard work and fairness. It was said that it was typical of Dunning that, although feeling ill, he remained on his feet throughout the reading and passage of his first set of estimates as Minister of Finance. As soon as the estimates were passed, Dunning collapsed and was rushed to the hospital to be treated for appendicitis.\n\nDunning was not only interested in domestic politics. He was also keenly interested in international politics, and particularly, in Canada's relationship with his \"old country\", the United Kingdom. Dunning participated in Canada's delegation to the [[League of Nations]].\n\nIn 1930, when the United States proposed the draconian Smoot-Hawley tariff, Canada's response was the Dunning tariff with increased duties and further tariff preference for the United Kingdom. The tariff was challenged by the opposition on the basis that the imperial preference was prejudicial to Canadian interests.\n\n==Defeated, returns to business==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dunningleg.jpg|left|thumb|190px| Premier's Portrait of Dunning Housed in the Legislative Gallery, Legislature of Saskatchewan]] -->Several months later, in the 1930 General Election, [[R.B. Bennett]] wrested power from King (notwithstanding Bennett's views while in opposition, the Dunning tariff remained in effect until renegotiated in the late 1930s). Dunning lost his Regina seat by over 3,500 votes (obtaining only two-thirds of the winner's total). Safe Liberal seats were offered to Dunning, but he turned them down, thinking that a business career would protect his family's financial future. He restarted his business career reorganizing an under-performing subsidiary of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], thereafter establishing a reputation as a brilliant re-organizer of insolvent companies.\n\n==Return to politics==\nKing regained power in the 1935 general election. He immediately went to Dunning, pressing him to re-enter polities. King convinced Dunning that he was needed in the tough economic times created by the [[Great Depression]], a sitting Member of Parliament stepped aside, and Dunning was yet again acclaimed in a 1936 by-election held in the constituency of [[Queen's (Prince Edward Island electoral district)|Queen's]] in [[Prince Edward Island]]. Dunning returned to the Finance portfolio. This time, one of Dunning's legacies was the establishment of the Central Mortgage Bank, today the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]].\n\n==Business executive==\nIn ill health, Dunning left politics in 1939, relocating to [[Montreal]]. In 1940, he was appointed as President and CEO of Ogilvie Flour Mills, a position he held until 1947, when he was appointed Chairman of the Board. In addition to his Board duties with Ogilvie, Dunning continued his business of corporate reorganization. He sat on a number of prestigious corporate and bank boards, including that of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\n==Chancellor of Queen's University==\nIn 1940, Dunning was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by [[Queen's University, Kingston|Queen's University]], and became [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the University. Dunning's abilities earned him the gratitude of the university, which named Dunning Hall (School of Economics) in his honour. The Chancellor Dunning Trust Lectureship was established by an anonymous donor, to \"promote the understanding and appreciation of the supreme importance of the dignity, freedom, and responsibility of the individual person in human society\". More recently, the University has established the Stauffer-Dunning Chair in Public Policy.\n\n[[File:Funeral plaque Charles Avery Dunning.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque about Dunning in [[Mount Royal Cemetery]].]]\n==Later life, honours==\nOther Universities which granted Honorary Doctorates to Dunning included [[McGill University]] in 1939 and the [[University of Saskatchewan]], in 1946. Charles Avery Dunning died in 1958 in Montreal. He was 74 years old.\n\nIn 2005, as part of Saskatchewan's centennial celebration, Dunning's memory was commemorated in two ways. First, the Provincial Revenue Building was renamed Dunning Place. (The Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company had its offices in the building when Dunning was General Manager). The choice is particularly appropriate, given Dunning's long tenure as Provincial Treasurer. \nSecond, on the initiative of Saskatchewan's [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Gordon Barnhart|Dr. Gordon Barnhart]], Dunning's gravesite, in Montreal's Mount Royal Cemetery, was commemorated by a bronze plaque, recognizing Dunning's contribution to the people of Saskatchewan.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Canadian Parliament links|ID=13007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817192235/http://cyr.gov.sk.ca/assets/pdf/WebsiteComplete.pdf Saskatchewan Government Booklet - Gravesites of Saskatchewan Premiers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050106091319/http://wascanapark.tripod.com/monuments/dunning.html Dunning Monument - Speaker's Corner]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050825214807/http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/History/bldgs/dunn.html Queen's University , Dunning and Dunning Hall ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080316040646/http://www.sahf.ca/profile.php?id=34 Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame]\n*[http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20030826.html CBC - article on Chretien/Martin tension - reference to King and Dunning]\n*[http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_zolf/20030417.html CBC - integrity in politics (mention of Dunning)]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{succession box\n| before=[[James Armstrong Richardson, Sr.]]\n| title=[[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]\n| years=1940\u20131958\n| after=[[John Bertram Stirling]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{SKPremiers}}\n{{Saskatchewan Liberal Party leaders}}\n{{CanMinFinance}}\n{{CA-Ministers of Transport}}\n{{Principals and Chancellors of Queen's University}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunning, Charles}}\n[[Category:1885 births]]\n[[Category:1958 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canadian farmers]]\n[[Category:Canadian Ministers of Finance]]\n[[Category:Canadian Ministers of Railways and Canals]]\n[[Category:Chancellors of Queen's University]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Prince Edward Island]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]]\n[[Category:Members of the United Church of Canada]]\n[[Category:People from Blaby District]]\n[[Category:Premiers of Saskatchewan]]\n[[Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)]]\n[[Category:Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLAs]]\n[[Category:Leaders of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "cap", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Avery_Dunning"}

The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 40 concurrent with Interstate 75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].
