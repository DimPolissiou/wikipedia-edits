Just ten years later, he was working ten-hour days at [[Littletown, County Durham|Littletown]] Colliery, Pittington, for a few pence a week, and by 21 he was a veteran of 15 pits.\n\nHis life, however, was not all work. He also had an enquiring mind and a love of books, inspired by his mother's regular reading sessions to the family. As he could not read himself, he took the brave step at the age of 20 to return to the classroom, to learn the basics from the beginning. He then headed for America in 1886 to improve himself still further, working in the mines of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky for two years.\n\nAfter returning to England in 1888, Lee began work at Wingate pit, where he was elected as delegate to the Miners Conference. He was then elected as checkweighman at Wingate four years later, but gave up the role to travel to South Africa in 1896. He returned a changed man. Lee became a committed Christian following his travels and, although he continued to work down the mines, he also studied and preached in local Methodist chapels.\n\nIn 1900, at the age of 33, he returned to Wheatley Hill Colliery, where he became the checkweighman, and also stood for the parish council. His council duties involved responsibility for sanitation and water purity within the village, as well as the creation of new roads and a cemetery. He went on to be elected as chairman of the council, as well as chairman of the local Co-operative and chairman of Durham County Water Board.\n\nBy 1909, Lee was a member of Durham County Council and, ten years later, he was elected as the chairman of the authority. And, despite his many responsibilities, he also found time to serve as the agent of Durham Miners Association and President of the Miners\u2019 Federation of Great Britain.\n\nAlthough Peter Lee died in 1935, some years before the town of Peterlee was created, his name lives on both in the town and in Peter Lee Methodist Church. The Right Honourable [[Jack Lawson|Lord Lawson]], the Lord Lieutenant of County Durham, paid tribute to Peter Lee in a souvenir brochure produced for the church in the 1950s, saying: \u201cPeter Lee was a living witness to the power of religion in the life of a man, and he gave ample testimony to it.

Strictly speaking, there are two main groups of dialects spoken in the [[Hejaz]] region,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Alzaidi|2014|p=73}}</ref> one by the urban population, originally spoken in the major cities of [[Jeddah]], [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and another by the [[Bedouin]] or rural populations. However, the term most often applies to the urban variety which is discussed in this article.\n\nIn antiquity, the Hejaz was home to the [[Old Higazi|Old Hejazi]] dialect of Arabic recorded in the consonantal text of the Qur'an. Old Hejazi is distinct from modern Hejazi Arabic, and represents an older linguistic layer wiped out by centuries of migration, but which happens to share the imperative prefix vowel /a-/ with the modern dialect.\n\n== Classification ==\nHejazi Arabic belongs to the western [[Peninsular Arabic]] branch of the [[Arabic language]], which itself is a [[Semitic language]]. It includes features of both urban and bedouin dialects giving its history between the ancient urban cities of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] and the bedouin tribes that lived on the outskirts of these cities.\n\n=== Features ===\nAlso referred to as the sedentary Hejazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term \"Hejazi Arabic\", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. With respect to the axis of [[bedouin]] versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both. Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties in some aspects and has therefore shed some Classical forms and features that are still present in bedouin dialects, these include gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker ''-n'' (see [[Varieties of Arabic]]). But in contrast to bedouin dialects, the constant use of full vowels and the absence of [[vowel reduction]] plus the distinction between the emphatic letters {{angbr|[[\u0636]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u0638]]}} is generally retained.\n\n==== Innovative features ====\n\n# The present progressive tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|\u0628\u0640}} {{IPA|/bi/}} or {{lang|acw|\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f}} {{IPA|/ga\u02d0\u0295id/}} as in {{lang|acw|\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/bijidrus/}} or {{lang|acw|\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f \u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/ga\u02d0\u0295id jidrus/}} (\"he is studying\").\n# The future tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|\u062d\u0640}} {{IPA|/\u0127a/}} as in {{lang|acw|\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/\u0127ajidrus/}} (\"he is going to study\").\n# the internal passive form, which in Hejazi, is replaced by the pattern ({{lang|acw|\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{IPA|/anfa\u0295al/}}, {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{IPA|/jinfa\u0295il/}}).\n# The final ''-n'' in present tense plural verb forms is no longer employed (e.g. {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0631\u0643\u0628\u0648\u0627}} {{IPA|/jirkabu/}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0631\u0643\u0628\u0648\u0646}} {{IPA|/jarkabu\u02d0n/}}).\n# The dominant case ending before the 3rd person masculine singular pronoun is ''-u'', rather than the ''-a'' that is prevalent in bedouin dialects. For example, {{lang|acw|\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0647}} {{IPA|/be\u02d0tu/}} (\"his house\"), {{lang|acw|\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0647}} {{IPA|/\u0295indu/}} (\"he has\"), {{lang|acw|\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647}} {{IPA|/a\u0295rifu/}} (\"I know him\").\n[[File:Semitic-map-english.gif|thumb|323x323px|right|Approximate distribution of Arabic language around the 1st century in [[Hejaz]] and [[Najd]]]]\n\n==== Conservative features ====\n# Hejazi Arabic does not employ [[double negative|double negation]], nor does it append the negation particles ''-sh'' to negate verbs: Hejazi {{lang|acw|\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0631\u0641}} {{IPA|/ma\u02d0 a\u0295rif/}} (\"I don't know\"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0634}} {{IPA|/ma\u0295raf\u0283/}} and [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0634}} {{IPA|/ba\u0295rafi\u0283/}}.\n#The present indicative tense is not marked by any prefixes as in {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0633}} {{IPA|/jidrus/}} (\"he studies\"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}}.\n# The prohibitive mood of Classical Arabic is preserved in the imperative: {{lang|acw|\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u062d}} {{IPA|/la\u02d0 tiru\u02d0\u0127/}} (\"don't go\").\n# The possessive suffixes are generally preserved in their Classical forms. For example, {{lang|acw|\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0643\u0645}} {{IPA|/be\u02d0takum/}} \"your (pl) house\".\n# The plural first person pronoun is {{lang|ar|\u0646\u062d\u0646\u0627}} {{IPA|/ni\u0127na/}} or {{lang|ar|\u0625\u062d\u0646\u0627}} {{IPA|/i\u0127na/}}, as opposed to the bedouin {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0646\u0651\u0627}} {{IPA|/\u0127\u0259nna/}} or {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0646\u0651\u0627}} {{IPA|/\u0259nna/}}.\n# When used to indicate location, the preposition {{lang|acw|\u0641\u064a}} {{IPA|/fi/}} is preferred to {{lang|acw|\u0628\u0640}} {{IPA|/b/}}.

Though the modern Hejazi dialects has developed markedly since the development of Classical Arabic, and Modern Standard Arabic is quite distinct from the modern dialect of Hejaz. Standard Arabic now differs considerably from modern Hejazi Arabic in terms of its phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Phonology and Morphology of Arabic|last=Watson|first=Janet|publisher=Oxford university press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=8, 9}}</ref> such diglossia in Arabic began to emerge at the latest in the sixth century CE when oral poets recited their poetry in a proto-Classical Arabic based on archaic dialects which differed greatly from their own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|last=Lipinski|first=|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=75}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, it is not well known in which stage of Arabic the shift from the [[Semitic languages#Phonology|Proto-Semitic]] pair {{IPA|/k\u02bc/}} q\u0101f and {{IPA|/g/}} g\u012bm came to be Hejazi {{IPA|/g, d\u0361\u0292/}} {{angbr|[[\u062c]], [[\u0642]]}} g\u0101f and j\u012bm, although it has been attested as early as the eighth century CE, and it can be explained by a [[chain shift]] {{IPA|/k\u02bc/}}* \u2192 {{IPA|/g/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cours de phon\u00e9tique arabe|last=Cantineau|first=Jean|publisher=Libraire C.

Furthermore, it has an eight-vowel system, consisting of three short and five long [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/a, u, i, a\u02d0, u\u02d0, o\u02d0, i\u02d0, e\u02d0/}}, in addition to two diphthongs {{IPA|/aw, aj/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Abdoh|2010|p=84}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Omar|1975|p=xv}}</ref> [[Consonant length]] and [[Vowel length]] are both distinctive in Hejazi.\n\nThe main conservative phonological feature that urban Hejazi holds in contrast to the neighboring urban and rural dialects of the [[Arabian peninsula]], is the constant use of full vowels and the absence of [[vowel reduction]], for example {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0645}} 'we told them', is pronounced {{IPA|[g\u028alna\u02d0lah\u028am]}} in Hejazi with full vowels but pronounced with the reduced vowel {{IPA|[\u0259]}} as {{IPA|[g\u0259lna\u02d0l\u0259h\u0259m]}} in [[Najdi Arabic|Najdi]]. In general it also retains the distinction between the letters {{angbr|[[\u1e0c\u0101d|\u0636]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u1e92\u0101\u02be|\u0638]]}}, but alternates between the pronunciations of the letters {{angbr|[[\u1e6e\u0101\u02be|\u062b]]}} ,{{angbr|[[\u1e0e\u0101l|\u0630]]}}, and {{angbr|[[\u1e92\u0101\u02be|\u0638]]}} which is a divergent feature. (See [[Hejazi Arabic phonology#Dental Assimilation|Hejazi Arabic Phonology]])\n\nAnother feature that differentiates Hejazi is the lack is the lack of [[Palatalization (sound change)#Dental Assimilation|palatalization]] for the letters {{lang|acw|\u0643}} {{IPA|/k/}}, {{lang|acw|\u0642}} {{IPA|/g/}} and {{lang|acw|\u062c}} {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}}, unlike in other [[Peninsular Arabic|peninsular dialects]] where they can be [[Palatalization (sound change)#Varieties of Arabic|palatalized]] and merged with other phonemes in certain positions<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Arabic Linguistics|last=Owens|first=Owens|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=259}}</ref> e.g. Hejazi \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f 'new' {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292adi\u02d0d]}} vs Gulf Arabic {{IPA|[j\u026adi\u02d0d]}}, it is also worth mentioning that this trait of non-palatalization is becoming common across Saudi Arabia especially in urban centers, another feature is that the \u0644 {{IPA|/l/}} is only [[Velarization|velarized]] /[[Alveolar lateral approximant#Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|\u026b]]/ in the word \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 /a\u026b\u02d0a\u02d0h/ 'god' (except when it follows an /i/: \u0628\u0633\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 {{IPA|/bism'''i'''l\u02d0a\u02d0h/}} or \u0644\u0644\u0647 {{IPA|/l'''i'''l\u02d0a\u02d0h/}}) and in words derived from it, unlike other peninsular dialects where it might be velarized [[Allophone|allophonically]], as in {{lang|acw|\u0639\u0642\u0644}} pronounced {{IPA|[\u0295a\u0261e\u031el]}} in Hejazi but {{IPA|[\u0295a\u0261\u0259\u026b]}} in other peninsular Arabic dialects.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Consonant phonemes of Hejazi (urban)\n!

The urban Hejazi vocabulary differs in some respect from that of other dialects in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, there are fewer specialized terms related to desert life, and more terms related to seafaring and fishing. Loanwords are mainly of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Romance languages|Latin]] ([[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) and [[English language|English]] origins, and due to the diverse origins of the inhabitants of Hejazi cities, some loanwords are only used by some families. A number of old loanwords are fading or became obsolete due to the influence of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and their association with lower social class and education,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Alahmadi|2015|p=45}}</ref> e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|/kun\u02c8de\u02d0\u0283an/}} \"[[Air conditioning|air conditioner]]\" (from English ''Condition'') was replaced by Standard Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0651\u0641}} {{IPA|/mukaj\u02d0if/}}. Most of the loanwords are nouns (with a change of meaning sometimes) as in: {{lang|ar|\u062c\u0632\u0645\u0629}} {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292azma/}} \"[[shoe]]\" from Turkish {{wikt-lang|tr|\u00e7izme}} {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283izme/}} originally meaning \"[[boot]]\" or {{lang|ar|\u0643\u064f\u0628\u0631\u064a}} {{IPA|/kubri/}} \"[[overpass]]\" from {{wikt-lang|tr|k\u00f6pr\u00fc}} {{IPA|/k\u00f8pry/}} originally meaning \"[[bridge]]\".\n\nSome general Hejazi expressions include {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642}} {{IPA|/bit\u02d0awfi\u02d0g/}} \"good luck\", {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0648\u0647}} {{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0wa/}} \"yes\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0623}} {{IPA|/la\u0294/}} \"no\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0633\u0629}} {{IPA|/lis\u02d0a/}} \"not yet\", {{lang|ar|\u0642\u062f}} {{IPA|/\u0261id/}} or {{lang|ar|\u0642\u064a\u062f}} {{IPA|/\u0261i\u02d0d/}} \"already\", {{lang|ar|\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0646}} {{IPA|/da\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/da\u0127e\u02d0n/}} \"now\", {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628\u063a\u0649}} {{IPA|/\u0294ab\u0263a/}} \"I want\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648 \u0633\u0645\u062d\u062a}} {{IPA|/law sama\u0127t/}} \"please/excuse me\" to a male and {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648 \u0633\u0645\u062d\u062a\u064a}} {{IPA|/law sama\u0127ti/}} \"please/excuse me\" to a female.\n\n=== Portmanteau ===\nA common feature in Hejazi vocabulary is [[Portmanteau|portmanteau words]] (also called a ''[[Blend word|blend]]'' in linguistics); in which parts of multiple [[word]]s or their [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] (sounds) are combined into a new word, it is especially innovative in making [[Interrogative words]], examples include:\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0648\u0647}} ({{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0wa/}}, \"yes\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a}} ({{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0/}}, \"yes\") and {{lang|ar|\u0648}} ({{IPA|/wa/}}, \"and\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} ({{IPA|/a\u026b\u02d0a\u02d0h/}}, \"god\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/ma\u0295le\u02d0\u0283/}}, is it ok?/sorry) : from {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ma\u02d0/}}, nothing) and {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647}} ({{IPA|/\u0295alajh/}}, on him) and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, thing).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/\u0294e\u02d0\u0283/}}, \"what?\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064a}} ({{IPA|/aj/}}, \"which\") and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, \"thing\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0644\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/le\u02d0\u0283/}}, \"why?\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0623\u064a}} ({{IPA|/li\u0294aj/}}, for what) and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, \"thing\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/fe\u02d0n/}}, where?) : from {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a}} ({{IPA|/fi\u02d0/}}, in) and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ajn/}}, where).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0644\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ile\u02d0n/}}, \"until\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0644\u0649}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ila\u02d0/}}, \"to\") and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/an/}}, \"that\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/da\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/da\u0127e\u02d0n/}}, \"now\") or {{lang|ar|\u0630\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u00f0a\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0a\u0127e\u02d0n/}}, \"now\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0630\u0627}} ({{IPA|/\u00f0a\u02d0/}}, \"this\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/al\u0127i\u02d0n/}}, part of time).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/ba\u0295de\u02d0n/}}, later) : from {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u062f}} (ba\u0295d, after) and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646}} (\u0294ayn, part of time).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0646}} or {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0295ala\u0283a\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/\u0295a\u0283a\u02d0n/}}, \"because\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649}} ({{IPA|/\u0295ala\u02d0/}}, \"on\") and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0283a\u0294n/}}, \"matter\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0646}} ({{IPA|/kama\u02d0n/}}, \"also\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0645\u0627}} ({{IPA|/kama\u02d0/}}, \"like\") and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294an/}}, \"that\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0644\u0651\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ja\u026b\u02d0a/}}, come on) : from {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ja\u02d0/}}, \"o!\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} ({{IPA|/a\u026b\u02d0a\u02d0h/}}, \"god\").\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe Cardinal number system in Hejazi is much more simplified than the Classical Arabic<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kheshaifaty|1997}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! numbers 1-10 !!

The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k-t-b}}'' 'to write', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bc-k-l}}'' 'to eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as :\n* Two tenses ('''past''', '''present'''; present progressive is indicated by the prefix (b-), future is indicated by the prefix (\u0127-))\n* Two voices (active, passive)\n* Two genders (masculine, feminine)\n* Three persons (first, second, third)\n* Two numbers (singular, plural)\n* Two moods (indicative, imperative).\nHejazi Has a single indicative present verb mood instead of the three Classical Arabic present verb moods (indicative \u0631\u0641\u0639, subjunctive \u0646\u0635\u0628, jussive {{lang|acw|\u062c\u0632\u0645}}), it also includes present progressive tense which was not part of the Classical Arabic grammar, and has a two grammatical number in verbs (Singular and Plural) instead of the Classical (Singular, Dual and Plural).\n\n==== Regular verbs ====\nThe most common verbs in Hejazi have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' and '''i''') to present ('''a''' or '''u''' or '''i''').

is written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]; like other [[varieties of Arabic]], Hejazi does not have a standard form of writing and mostly follows Classical Arabic rules of writing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Arabic: Structures, Functions, and Varieties|last = Holes|first = Clive|publisher = Georgetown University Press, Washington D.C.|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = 92}}</ref> In general people alternate between writing the words according to their etymology or the phoneme used while pronouncing them, which mainly has an effect on the three letters {{angbr|[[\u1e6e\u0101\u02be|\u062b]]}} {{angbr|[[\u1e0e\u0101l|\u0630]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u1e92\u0101\u02be|\u0638]]}}, for example writing {{lang|acw|\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0646}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u062b\u062e\u064a\u0646}} or {{lang|acw|\u062f\u064a\u0644}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u0630\u064a\u0644}} although this alternation in writing is not considered acceptable by all Hejazi speakers.\n\nAnother alternation which is more likely to appear happens when writing words that end in a short vowel {{IPA|/a, u, i/}}, the writer would choose whether to add a vowel letter {{angbr|\u0648}} {{angbr|\u0627}} or {{angbr|\u064a}} at the end of the word as in {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a\u064a}} {{IPA|/inti/}} ('you' singular feminine) to differentiate it from {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} {{IPA|/inta/}} ('you' singular masculine), or use the Classical form {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} which can be pronounced {{IPA|/inta/}} or {{IPA|/inti/}}, this happens since most word-final short vowels from the Classical Arabic period have been omitted and most word-final unstressed long vowel letters have been shortened in Hejazi. In Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written, and when needed to be written they are written in a form of [[Arabic diacritics|diacritics]]; <big>{{lang|acw|\u0640\u064e}}</big> above the letter for {{IPA|/a/}}, <big>{{lang|acw|\u0640\u064f}}</big> above the letter for {{IPA|/u/}}, <big>{{lang|ar|\u0640\u0650}}</big> under the letter for {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nThe table below shows the Arabic alphabet letters and their corresponding phonemes in Hejazi:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, the speech of some tribes shows much closer affinity to other bedouin dialects, particularly those of neighboring [[Najd]], than to those of the urban Hejazi cities. The dialects of northern Hejazi tribes [[Dialect continuum|merge]] into those of [[Jordan]] and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], while the dialects in the south [[Dialect continuum|merge]] with those of [['Asir]] and [[Najd]]. Also, not all speakers of these bedouin dialects are figuratively [[nomadic]] bedouins; some are simply sedentary sections that live in rural areas, and thus speak dialects similar to those of their bedouin neighbors.\n\n=== Al-`Ula ===\nThe dialect of [[Al-`Ula]] governorate in the northern part of the [[Al Madinah Region|Madinah region]]. Although understudied, it is considered to be unique among the Hejazi dialects, it is known for its pronunciation of Classical Arabic {{angbr|[[Kaph|\u0643]]}} {{IPA|/k/}} as a {{angbr|[[Shin (letter)|\u0634]]}} {{IPA|/[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|\u0283]]/}} (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0643\u0630\u0628}} {{IPA|/tak\u00f0ib/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0634\u0630\u0628}} {{IPA|/ta\u0283\u00f0ib/}}), the dialect also shows a tendency to pronounce long {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} as {{IPAblink|e|e\u02d0}} (e.g. Classical {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0621}} {{IPA|/ma\u02d0\u0294/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u0645\u064a\u0621}} [me\u02d0\u0294]), in some instances the Classical {{IPA|/q/}} becomes a {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}} as in {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0629}} {{IPA|/qa\u02d0jla/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0629}} {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292a\u02d0jla/}}, also the second person singular feminine pronoun {{IPA|/ik/}} tends to be pronounced as /i[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|\u0283]]/ (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0643}} {{IPA|/rid\u0361\u0292lik/}} ('your foot') becomes {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0634}} {{IPA|/rid\u0361\u0292li\u0283/}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2008/20080629/wo5.htm|title=Spoken Al-'Ula dialect between privacy and fears of extinction.

Strictly speaking, there are two main groups of dialects spoken in the [[Hejaz]] region,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Alzaidi|2014|p=73}}</ref> one by the urban population, originally spoken in the major cities of [[Jeddah]], [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and another by the [[Bedouin]] or rural populations. However, the term most often applies to the urban variety which is discussed in this article.\n\nIn antiquity, the Hejaz was home to the [[Old Higazi|Old Hejazi]] dialect of Arabic recorded in the consonantal text of the Qur'an. Old Hejazi is distinct from modern Hejazi Arabic, and represents an older linguistic layer wiped out by centuries of migration, but which happens to share the imperative prefix vowel /a-/ with the modern dialect.\n\n== Classification ==\nHejazi Arabic belongs to the western [[Peninsular Arabic]] branch of the [[Arabic language]], which itself is a [[Semitic language]]. It includes features of both urban and bedouin dialects giving its history between the ancient urban cities of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] and the bedouin tribes that lived on the outskirts of these cities.\n\n=== Features ===\nAlso referred to as the sedentary Hejazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term \"Hejazi Arabic\", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. With respect to the axis of [[bedouin]] versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both. Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties in some aspects and has therefore shed some Classical forms and features that are still present in bedouin dialects, these include gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker ''-n'' (see [[Varieties of Arabic]]). But in contrast to bedouin dialects, the constant use of full vowels and the absence of [[vowel reduction]] plus the distinction between the emphatic letters {{angbr|[[\u0636]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u0638]]}} is generally retained.\n\n==== Innovative features ====\n\n# The present progressive tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|\u0628\u0640}} {{IPA|/bi/}} or {{lang|acw|\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f}} {{IPA|/ga\u02d0\u0295id/}} as in {{lang|acw|\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/bijidrus/}} or {{lang|acw|\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f \u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/ga\u02d0\u0295id jidrus/}} (\"he is studying\").\n# The future tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|\u062d\u0640}} {{IPA|/\u0127a/}} as in {{lang|acw|\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}} {{IPA|/\u0127ajidrus/}} (\"he is going to study\").\n# the internal passive form, which in Hejazi, is replaced by the pattern ({{lang|acw|\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{IPA|/anfa\u0295al/}}, {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0644}} {{IPA|/jinfa\u0295il/}}).\n# The final ''-n'' in present tense plural verb forms is no longer employed (e.g. {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0631\u0643\u0628\u0648\u0627}} {{IPA|/jirkabu/}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0631\u0643\u0628\u0648\u0646}} {{IPA|/jarkabu\u02d0n/}}).\n# The dominant case ending before the 3rd person masculine singular pronoun is ''-u'', rather than the ''-a'' that is prevalent in bedouin dialects. For example, {{lang|acw|\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0647}} {{IPA|/be\u02d0tu/}} (\"his house\"), {{lang|acw|\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0647}} {{IPA|/\u0295indu/}} (\"he has\"), {{lang|acw|\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647}} {{IPA|/a\u0295rifu/}} (\"I know him\").\n[[File:Semitic-map-english.gif|thumb|323x323px|right|Approximate distribution of Arabic language around the 1st century in [[Hejaz]] and [[Najd]]]]\n\n==== Conservative features ====\n# Hejazi Arabic does not employ [[double negative|double negation]], nor does it append the negation particles ''-sh'' to negate verbs: Hejazi {{lang|acw|\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0631\u0641}} {{IPA|/ma\u02d0 a\u0295rif/}} (\"I don't know\"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0634}} {{IPA|/ma\u0295raf\u0283/}} and [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0634}} {{IPA|/ba\u0295rafi\u0283/}}.\n#The present indicative tense is not marked by any prefixes as in {{lang|acw|\u064a\u0650\u062f\u0652\u0631\u064f\u0633}} {{IPA|/jidrus/}} (\"he studies\"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633}}.\n# The prohibitive mood of Classical Arabic is preserved in the imperative: {{lang|acw|\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u062d}} {{IPA|/la\u02d0 tiru\u02d0\u0127/}} (\"don't go\").\n# The possessive suffixes are generally preserved in their Classical forms.

The urban Hejazi vocabulary differs in some respect from that of other dialects in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, there are fewer specialized terms related to desert life, and more terms related to seafaring and fishing. Loanwords are mainly of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Romance languages|Latin]] ([[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) and [[English language|English]] origins, and due to the diverse origins of the inhabitants of Hejazi cities, some loanwords are only used by some families. A number of old loanwords are fading or became obsolete due to the influence of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and their association with lower social class and education,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Alahmadi|2015|p=45}}</ref> e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0634\u0646}} {{IPA|/kun\u02c8de\u02d0\u0283an/}} \"[[Air conditioning|air conditioner]]\" (from English ''Condition'') was replaced by Standard Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0651\u0641}} {{IPA|/mukaj\u02d0if/}}. Most of the loanwords are nouns (with a change of meaning sometimes) as in: {{lang|ar|\u062c\u0632\u0645\u0629}} {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292azma/}} \"[[shoe]]\" from Turkish {{wikt-lang|tr|\u00e7izme}} {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283izme/}} originally meaning \"[[boot]]\" or {{lang|ar|\u0643\u064f\u0628\u0631\u064a}} {{IPA|/kubri/}} \"[[overpass]]\" from {{wikt-lang|tr|k\u00f6pr\u00fc}} {{IPA|/k\u00f8pry/}} originally meaning \"[[bridge]]\".\n\nSome general Hejazi expressions include {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642}} {{IPA|/bit\u02d0awfi\u02d0g/}} \"good luck\", {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0648\u0647}} {{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0wa/}} \"yes\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0623}} {{IPA|/la\u0294/}} \"no\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0633\u0629}} {{IPA|/lis\u02d0a/}} \"not yet\", {{lang|ar|\u0642\u062f}} {{IPA|/\u0261id/}} or {{lang|ar|\u0642\u064a\u062f}} {{IPA|/\u0261i\u02d0d/}} \"already\", {{lang|ar|\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0646}} {{IPA|/da\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/da\u0127e\u02d0n/}} \"now\", {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628\u063a\u0649}} {{IPA|/\u0294ab\u0263a/}} \"I want\", {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648 \u0633\u0645\u062d\u062a}} {{IPA|/law sama\u0127t/}} \"please/excuse me\" to a male and {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648 \u0633\u0645\u062d\u062a\u064a}} {{IPA|/law sama\u0127ti/}} \"please/excuse me\" to a female.\n\n=== Portmanteau ===\nA common feature in Hejazi vocabulary is [[Portmanteau|portmanteau words]] (also called a ''[[Blend word|blend]]'' in linguistics); in which parts of multiple [[word]]s or their [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] (sounds) are combined into a new word, it is especially innovative in making [[Interrogative words]], examples include:\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0648\u0647}} ({{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0wa/}}, \"yes\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a}} ({{IPA|/\u0294i\u02d0/}}, \"yes\") and {{lang|ar|\u0648}} ({{IPA|/wa/}}, \"and\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} ({{IPA|/a\u026b\u02d0a\u02d0h/}}, \"god\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/ma\u0295le\u02d0\u0283/}}, is it ok?/sorry) : from {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ma\u02d0/}}, nothing) and {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647}} ({{IPA|/\u0295alajh/}}, on him) and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, thing).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/\u0294e\u02d0\u0283/}}, \"what?\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064a}} ({{IPA|/aj/}}, \"which\") and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, \"thing\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0644\u064a\u0634}} ({{IPA|/le\u02d0\u0283/}}, \"why?\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0644\u0623\u064a}} ({{IPA|/li\u0294aj/}}, for what) and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u064a\u0621}} ({{IPA|/\u0283aj\u0294/}}, \"thing\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/fe\u02d0n/}}, where?) : from {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a}} ({{IPA|/fi\u02d0/}}, in) and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ajn/}}, where).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0644\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ile\u02d0n/}}, \"until\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0644\u0649}} ({{IPA|/\u0294ila\u02d0/}}, \"to\") and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/an/}}, \"that\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/da\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/da\u0127e\u02d0n/}}, \"now\") or {{lang|ar|\u0630\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u00f0a\u0127i\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0a\u0127e\u02d0n/}}, \"now\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0630\u0627}} ({{IPA|/\u00f0a\u02d0/}}, \"this\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/al\u0127i\u02d0n/}}, part of time).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0646}} ({{IPA|/ba\u0295de\u02d0n/}}, later) : from {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0639\u062f}} (ba\u0295d, after) and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646}} (\u0294ayn, part of time).\n* {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0646}} or {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0295ala\u0283a\u02d0n/}} or {{IPA|/\u0295a\u0283a\u02d0n/}}, \"because\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649}} ({{IPA|/\u0295ala\u02d0/}}, \"on\") and {{lang|ar|\u0634\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0283a\u0294n/}}, \"matter\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0646}} ({{IPA|/kama\u02d0n/}}, \"also\") : from {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0645\u0627}} ({{IPA|/kama\u02d0/}}, \"like\") and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646}} ({{IPA|/\u0294an/}}, \"that\").\n* {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0644\u0651\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ja\u026b\u02d0a/}}, come on) : from {{lang|ar|\u064a\u0627}} ({{IPA|/ja\u02d0/}}, \"o!\") and {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} ({{IPA|/a\u026b\u02d0a\u02d0h/}}, \"god\").\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe Cardinal number system in Hejazi is much more simplified than the Classical Arabic<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kheshaifaty|1997}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! numbers 1-10 !!

The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k-t-b}}'' 'to write', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bc-k-l}}'' 'to eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as :\n* Two tenses ('''past''', '''present'''; present progressive is indicated by the prefix (b-), future is indicated by the prefix (\u0127-))\n* Two voices (active, passive)\n* Two genders (masculine, feminine)\n* Three persons (first, second, third)\n* Two numbers (singular, plural)\n* Two moods (indicative, imperative).\nHejazi Has a single indicative present verb mood instead of the three Classical Arabic present verb moods (indicative \u0631\u0641\u0639, subjunctive \u0646\u0635\u0628, jussive {{lang|acw|\u062c\u0632\u0645}}), it also includes present progressive tense which was not part of the Classical Arabic grammar, and has a two grammatical number in verbs (Singular and Plural) instead of the Classical (Singular, Dual and Plural).\n\n==== Regular verbs ====\nThe most common verbs in Hejazi have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' and '''i''') to present ('''a''' or '''u''' or '''i''').

is written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]; like other [[varieties of Arabic]], Hejazi does not have a standard form of writing and mostly follows Classical Arabic rules of writing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Arabic: Structures, Functions, and Varieties|last = Holes|first = Clive|publisher = Georgetown University Press, Washington D.C.|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = 92}}</ref> In general people alternate between writing the words according to their etymology or the phoneme used while pronouncing them, which mainly has an effect on the three letters {{angbr|[[\u1e6e\u0101\u02be|\u062b]]}} {{angbr|[[\u1e0e\u0101l|\u0630]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u1e92\u0101\u02be|\u0638]]}}, for example writing {{lang|acw|\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0646}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u062b\u062e\u064a\u0646}} or {{lang|acw|\u062f\u064a\u0644}} instead of {{lang|acw|\u0630\u064a\u0644}} although this alternation in writing is not considered acceptable by all Hejazi speakers.\n\nAnother alternation which is more likely to appear happens when writing words that end in a short vowel {{IPA|/a, u, i/}}, the writer would choose whether to add a vowel letter {{angbr|\u0648}} {{angbr|\u0627}} or {{angbr|\u064a}} at the end of the word as in {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a\u064a}} {{IPA|/inti/}} ('you' singular feminine) to differentiate it from {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} {{IPA|/inta/}} ('you' singular masculine), or use the Classical form {{lang|acw|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} which can be pronounced {{IPA|/inta/}} or {{IPA|/inti/}}, this happens since most word-final short vowels from the Classical Arabic period have been omitted and most word-final unstressed long vowel letters have been shortened in Hejazi. In Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written, and when needed to be written they are written in a form of [[Arabic diacritics|diacritics]]; <big>{{lang|acw|\u0640\u064e}}</big> above the letter for {{IPA|/a/}}, <big>{{lang|acw|\u0640\u064f}}</big> above the letter for {{IPA|/u/}}, <big>{{lang|ar|\u0640\u0650}}</big> under the letter for {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nThe table below shows the Arabic alphabet letters and their corresponding phonemes in Hejazi:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, the speech of some tribes shows much closer affinity to other bedouin dialects, particularly those of neighboring [[Najd]], than to those of the urban Hejazi cities. The dialects of northern Hejazi tribes [[Dialect continuum|merge]] into those of [[Jordan]] and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], while the dialects in the south [[Dialect continuum|merge]] with those of [['Asir]] and [[Najd]]. Also, not all speakers of these bedouin dialects are figuratively [[nomadic]] bedouins; some are simply sedentary sections that live in rural areas, and thus speak dialects similar to those of their bedouin neighbors.\n\n=== Al-`Ula ===\nThe dialect of [[Al-`Ula]] governorate in the northern part of the [[Al Madinah Region|Madinah region]]. Although understudied, it is considered to be unique among the Hejazi dialects, it is known for its pronunciation of Classical Arabic {{angbr|[[Kaph|\u0643]]}} {{IPA|/k/}} as a {{angbr|[[Shin (letter)|\u0634]]}} {{IPA|/[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|\u0283]]/}} (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0643\u0630\u0628}} {{IPA|/tak\u00f0ib/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u062a\u0634\u0630\u0628}} {{IPA|/ta\u0283\u00f0ib/}}), the dialect also shows a tendency to pronounce long {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} as {{IPAblink|e|e\u02d0}} (e.g. Classical {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0621}} {{IPA|/ma\u02d0\u0294/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u0645\u064a\u0621}} [me\u02d0\u0294]), in some instances the Classical {{IPA|/q/}} becomes a {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}} as in {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0629}} {{IPA|/qa\u02d0jla/}} becomes {{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0629}} {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292a\u02d0jla/}}, also the second person singular feminine pronoun {{IPA|/ik/}} tends to be pronounced as /i[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|\u0283]]/ (e.g. {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0643}} {{IPA|/rid\u0361\u0292lik/}} ('your foot') becomes {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0634}} {{IPA|/rid\u0361\u0292li\u0283/}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2008/20080629/wo5.htm|title=Spoken Al-'Ula dialect between privacy and fears of extinction.
