Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>\n\nThe story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.\n\nSalome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.\n\nAfter putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.\n\nIn Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrates the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.\n\nConan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Shemite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Shemite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Shemites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.\n\nSoon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"\n\nSalome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust\u2014even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Avon Fantasy Reader'' #10 (1949). The first reprinting of the story. Unknown artist.]]\n\nA theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nHoward may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.\n\nLouinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character\u2014literarily or literally\u2014who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nThe supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E.

Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states \"You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...You civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as ours.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\n==Background==\nThis story was written in late May or early June 1934.<ref name=\"Louinet\">{{Citation |last = Louinet |first = Patrice |year = 2003 |title = The Bloody Crown of Conan |chapter = Hyborian Genesis Part II |publisher = Del Rey Books |isbn = 0-345-46152-5 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 358\u2013359] |chapter-url-access = registration |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 }}</ref>  [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was running out of Conan stories which were growing in popularity and attracting new readers to the magazine.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  Howard had recently finished the Conan novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', which was not intended for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and the story previous to that, \"[[The People of the Black Circle]]\" was already scheduled for August.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He finished \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" in only two drafts over a period of days in order to meet this deadline.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> Wright accepted it without hesitation, telling Howard it was his best Conan story to date, and made it the cover story for the December issue.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n==Reception==\nHoward scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story is only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\nOn the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".\n\n==Publication history==\nThe story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.\n\nA version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] appeared in the collection ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1955 collection)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' ([[Gnome Press]], 1954).  This was reprinted several times, including the collection ''[[Conan the Freebooter]]'' ([[Lancer Books]], 1968).<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  It was first published by itself in book form by [[Donald M.

The crucifixion scene was adapted for the first Conan film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982). The original script for the film, written by [[Oliver Stone]], was based on this novella and another Conan story, \"[[Black Colossus]]\", and re-set in a post-apocalyptic future.<ref name=\"vongunden\">{{cite book |last=Von Gunden |first=Kenneth |title=Flights of Fancy |url=https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong |url-access=registration |pages = [https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong/page/20 20\u201322] |publisher=McFarland |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7864-1214-3 }}</ref> When [[John Milius]] took over directing the film, he had the script changed but retained the crucifixion scene, described by Kenneth Von Gunden as \"Howard's quintessential Conan scene: the mighty Cimmerian, hanging on a cross, nails driven through his hands and feet, tearing out the throat of a vulture which comes to peck out his eyes.\"<ref name=\"vongunden\" />\n\nThe name \"[[Queen Taramis]]\" was also used in the second Conan movie, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984), played by actress [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]].

With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.\n\nSoon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"\n\nSalome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust\u2014even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Avon Fantasy Reader'' #10 (1949). The first reprinting of the story. Unknown artist.]]\n\nA theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nHoward may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.\n\nLouinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character\u2014literarily or literally\u2014who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nThe supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E.

Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states \"You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...You civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as ours.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\n==Background==\nThis story was written in late May or early June 1934.<ref name=\"Louinet\">{{Citation |last = Louinet |first = Patrice |year = 2003 |title = The Bloody Crown of Conan |chapter = Hyborian Genesis Part II |publisher = Del Rey Books |isbn = 0-345-46152-5 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 358\u2013359] |chapter-url-access = registration |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 }}</ref>  [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was running out of Conan stories which were growing in popularity and attracting new readers to the magazine.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  Howard had recently finished the Conan novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', which was not intended for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and the story previous to that, \"[[The People of the Black Circle]]\" was already scheduled for August.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He finished \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" in only two drafts over a period of days in order to meet this deadline.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> Wright accepted it without hesitation, telling Howard it was his best Conan story to date, and made it the cover story for the December issue.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n==Reception==\nHoward scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story in only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\nOn the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".\n\n==Publication history==\nThe story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.\n\nA version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L.

The crucifixion scene was adapted for the first Conan film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982).

They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater.

This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow.

''G7'' fired a torpedo at ''U-30'' and after an exchange of gunfire the German submarine dived away.

One, {{Ship|SS|Svanfos|1905|2}}, which still had a boarding party from ''U-30'' aboard, returned to Bergen under her own steam, while the second, the ''Borgila'', had been abandoned by her crew.

The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==Career==\nLike the rest of her class, ''G7''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. On 15 April 1917, ''G7'' was patrolling between [[Lerwick]] and [[Bergen]] when she sighted the German submarine {{ship|SM|U-30|Germany|2}}. ''G7'' fired a torpedo at ''U-30'' and after an exchange of gunfire the German submarine dived away. Although ''U-30'' escaped unscathed, ''G7'' had interrupted ''U30''{{'}}s attempts to sink two Norwegian merchant ships. One, {{Ship|SS|Svanfos|1905|2}}, which still had a boarding party from ''U-30'' aboard, returned to Bergen under her own steam, while the second, the ''Borgila'', had been abandoned by her crew. ''G7'' put a salvage party aboard ''Borgila'' until the Norwegian destroyer {{Ship|HNoMS|Draug|1908|2}} arrived to take over.<ref>''Monograph No. 34'', &nbsp;p. 460.</ref>\n\nIn October 1918 ''G7'' was on patrol in the North Sea.

The eight generation family consists of: 7\" (2012 model), 8.9\" (2012 model), 7\" (2013 model), 6\" & 7\" (2014 models), 8\" & 10.1\" (2015 models), 8\" (2016 model), 8\" & 10.1\" (2017 models), 8\" (2018 model) and 10.1\" (2019 model). These devices run the [[Fire OS]] operating system.\n\n==History==\nThe first model was announced on September 6, 2012 and was available in two versions, 7\" and 8.9\".  The 7\" model was released in United States on September 14, then France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom on October 25 and in Japan on December 18. The 8.9\" model was released on November 20 in United States, in Japan on March 12, 2013 in Germany on March 13, and in India on June 27.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/09/kobo-new-ereaders/|title=Kobo Announces Their New E-Readers|first=|last=Jules|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"amazones\">[https://www.amazon.es/s/?__mk_es_ES=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD Amazon.es: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonit\">[https://www.amazon.it/s/?__mk_it_IT=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0 Amazon.it: Kindle Fire HD]</ref><ref name=\"amazonfr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/s/?__mk_fr_FR%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Amazon.fr : Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.fr}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonde\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/s/?__mk_de_DE%253D%25C5M%25C5Z%25D5%25D1%2526url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD|title=Suchergebnis auf Amazon.de f\u00fcr: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.de}}</ref><ref name=\"amazonuk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Kindle+Fire+HD&x=0&y=0|title=Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Fire HD|website=www.amazon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Fire HD second generation was released. The price of the Fire HD 7\" was reduced to $139, the processor speed was upgraded to 1.5&nbsp;GHz, upgraded from \"Android based\" OS to a compatible [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Android named [[Fire OS]] 3, removed the front camera, used a new form factor and decreased the available storage options. In addition, the Fire HD's successor the [[Kindle Fire HDX]] was introduced.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, the Fire HD third generation was released, which is part of the Fire Tablet's fourth generation, with 6-inch and 7-inch [[touchscreen]] sizes. In addition, the Fire HD Kids Edition was released, which is the same device as the Fire HD 6 except it comes with a case and one-year subscription to Kindle Freetime apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-kindle-fire-tablets/|title=Amazon Kindle Cheat Sheet|work=CNET|accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref> In addition, the name \"Kindle\" was officially removed from the tablets' name.\n\nIn September 2015, Amazon released a new range of Fire tablets with 7, 8, and 10.1 inch sizes. The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.\n\nIn 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.\n\nIn September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.\n\nOn October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference \u2014 September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers.

The 7 inch was simply called the [[kindle fire|Fire 7]], while the 8\" and 10.1\" were called Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 respectively. The Fire 7 is unique as it is, thus far, the lowest priced Fire tablet at $50.  In September 2016, Amazon announced the new Fire HD 8 with Alexa<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon's new Fire HD 8 is its first tablet with Alexa|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablet-with-alexa/|website=engadget.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> starting at $90.\n\nIn 2017, the seventh Generation Fire 7 Fire HD 8 were released. Some differences between the 6th and 7th Generation HD 8 models were the price, the gyroscope removal, the increase of maximum SD card expansion, and the better graphics chip.\n\nIn September 2018, Amazon refreshed their Fire tablet line with the release of eighth Generation Fire HD 8/Kids Edition and HD 10. The price remained the same as last year's model with minor upgrade on the hardware where the external storage is expandable to 400GB. On the software side, the 2018 model is preinstalled with Fire OS 6 that allows hands-free Alexa control.\n\nOn October 7, 2019 Amazon announced an update to the Fire HD 10 which will be released on October 30, 2019. The major hardware differences compared to the previous version were replacement of microUSB with USB-C, a faster processor (upgraded from Quad-Core up to 1.8 GHz to Octa-core 2.0 GHz, which Amazon claims is 30% faster than the previous one) and battery life that is 2 hours longer than the previous generation. The screen size and price remained unchanged. A new color option, white, has also been added.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe Fire tablets feature multi-touch [[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] screens. The first generation 7\" model contains a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]] 4460 processor, while the 8.9\" model uses an OMAP 4470 processor.<ref name=\"launch2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg|title=Amazon Kindle Press Conference \u2014 September 6, 2012 |work=YouTube}}</ref> All three models feature [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby audio]] and stereo speakers. The 7\" model's speakers are dual-driver, while the 8.9\" model's are single-driver.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The device has two Wi-Fi antennas on the [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands]] which utilize [[MIMO]] to improve reception.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The Fire HD also added [[Bluetooth]] connectivity allowing users to connect an array of wireless accessories including keyboards.<ref name=\"launch2012\" /> The first generation models have an HDMI port, but this is missing from future generations.\n\nIn June 2016, Amazon released a version of the Fire HD 10 that has an aluminum exterior instead of plastic like the other Fire tablets, and is available at the same price as the plastic version.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/2/11838204/amazon-adds-metal-fire-10-64gb Amazon now sells a metal version of its Fire 10 tablet] The Verge Retrieved 2 June 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Software ===\nThe 2012 models use software that introduced user profiles for sharing among family members and the ability to place absolute limits on total usage or usage of individual features, called FreeTime, and tracks the user's reading speed to predict when the user will finish a chapter or book. The OS is based on a version of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\"]]. This does not allow use of [[Google Play]], limiting the number of apps accessible for the Fire HD. Fire HD software updates can be received [[Over-the-air programming|OTA]] or from the support websites.<ref name=\"kf-specsheet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201016350|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 7\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201075600|title=Amazon.com Help: Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" (2nd Generation) Software Updates|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Fire HD 7\" second generation used [[Fire OS]] 3. Note that although this version is called the Fire HD 7\", it is not the successor to the original Fire HD. This model is the successor to the Fire second generation. The Fire HD models second generation were updated to FireOS 4.1.1, based on Android 4.4.4, in Q3 2014.\n\nThe Fire HD 6\" and 7\" third generation uses Fire OS 4 \"Sangria\", which features profiles so each user on the tablet can have their own settings and apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidguys.com/2014/09/17/whats-new-amazons-fire-os-4-0-sangria/|title=What's new with Amazon's Fire OS 4.0 \"Sangria\"?|work=AndroidGuys}}</ref>\n\nThe Fire HD 8 and 10 fifth generation uses Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\" and was released in late 2015.  In September 2016, Amazon released virtual assistant Alexa for the sixth generation Fire tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/08/amazon-fire-alexa/|title=Amazon Debuts Its First Fire Tablet With Virtual Assistant Alexa|website=fortune.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 model of the Fire HD 8 has Fire OS 6 preinstalled, which is based on [[Android Nougat|Android 7.1 \"Nougat\"]].
