The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. According to the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

{"title_page": "Economy of Hispania", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:GordianusIsest.jpg|right|250px]]\nThe '''economy of Hispania''', or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], experienced a strong revolution during and after the conquest of the peninsular territory by Rome, in such a way that, from an unknown but promising land, it came to be one of the most valuable acquisitions of both the Republic and Empire and a basic pillar that sustained the rise of Rome.\n\n==The Pre-Roman economy==\nBefore the entrance of Rome into Iberia, almost all of the peninsula was based on a rural [[subsistence economy]] with little or very limited trade, with the exception of the largest cities, located mainly on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, which had regular contact with [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phonecia|Phoenician]] commerce.\n\n===The economic strategy of the Roman conquest===\nPhoenician legends had traditionally circulated throughout the Mediterranean about the infinite riches of the [[Tartessos]] and how commercial expeditions returned from the coast of [[Hispania]] loaded with cargoes of [[silver]].  Undoubtedly, these stories contributed to the increase in interest of the Mediterranean powers in the Iberian peninsula.\n\n[[File:Utilesesparto.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mining tools from the mines of New Carthage. Municipal Archaeological Museum of Cartagena]]\nAfter their defeat in the [[First Punic War]], [[Carthage]] was overwhelmed by the loss of important markets and by the tribute it had to pay Rome as compensation for the war.  With the goal of alleviating this situation, the Carthagenians decided to expand along the coast of Iberia, which had until then been outside the area of Roman influence.  Carthage, interested above all in getting quick profit, exploited the silver mines along the coastline of [[Andalusia]] and [[Levante, Spain|Levante]], extracting large amounts of this metal with which it financed a great part of the [[Second Punic War]] and [[Hannibal| Hannibal's]] Italian campaign.\n\nWith this purpose and others, one of the first strategic objectives of Rome when invading the peninsula was to take the mines near [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]].  In part due to the loss of these resources, and in greater part due to the isolation he found himself in, Hannibal had to renounce the war in Italy in 206 BC.\n\t\nAfter the expulsion of Carthage, part of the indigenous peoples of Hispania were forced to pay [[tribute]] to Rome through an intricate web of alliances and allegiances. Despite this, throughout the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Rome took the unconquered lands of Hispania as an opportunity to pillage and plunder, frequently breaking peace treaties, like the accords from the times of [[Graccus Sempronius]], which had allowed long periods of peace. The uprising of the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] peoples only served to increase revenues from Rome via the immense spoils of war from the campaigns of [[Cato the Elder]].\n\nThis policy of obtaining riches by force had its continuation in the campaigns of Pompey and later Julius Caesar, whom the histories say undertook not only to fight Pompey, but to profit from the conquest in order pay his creditors.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Spain|Spanish]] Mediterranean coast, which had been conquered during the war against Carthage and rapidly Romanized, began its economic and commercial expansion that would soon make it famous in the Roman world.\n\n==The economy of Romanized Hispania==\nBesides the exploitation of mineral resources, Rome obtained with the conquest of Hispania access to what were probably the best agricultural lands in all of Romanized territory.  Therefore, it became necessary to use those lands as soon as possible.  During the Roman domination of the area, the economy of Hispania experienced a major production expansion, fueled further by roads and [[trade route]]s that opened the markets of the rest of the Empire.\n\n===Circulating currency===\nOne of most obvious symbols of civilization that foreign cultures brought to Hispania was the minting of [[coins]] to facilitate commercial transactions.  Beforehand, the peninsular economy was based on the barter system, exchanging products rather than currency, but beginning in the 3rd century BC, Greek colonies like [[Emp\u00faries|Ampurias]] began minting coins, but with no influence beyond its boundaries.\n\nLater, Carthage would introduce a more general use of the coins as payment for its troops, before and during the Roman invasion; but it would be the Romans who would impose the use of currency throughout the Spanish territory, and not just that currency whose value was based on the metal contained in the coin, but others of lower value than the [[alloy]] that comprised them, and were endorsed by the Roman [[treasury]]. From the abundance of coins found, especially those of lower value, one can draw the conclusion that the money was used widely in everyday life. During expansion of Rome in Spain, many peoples of the Peninsula minted their own coins in order to facilitate payment of tribute and trade with the area under Roman rule.\n\t\nThroughout the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period, it was the [[Roman Senate]] that completely controlled the issuance of coinage through the monetary courts, but later, with the rise of the dictators, its control was reduced to lower valued coins, later passing many of the mints to imperial control.\n\t\nOnce Roman power in Hispania was consolidated, there were many mints that coined money, such as Tarraco (the first of the Roman mints in Hispania), Italica, Barcino, Caesaraugusta, Emerita Augusta, etc.  And throughout the Empire, more than 400 mints provided coinage to most of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n===Minerals===\n[[File:TEXEO RIOSA ASTURIAS BOCA ROMANA MINAS DE COBRE 002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Entrances to a copper mine in [[Texeo]] ([[Principado de Asturias]]) mined in Roman times.]]\n[[File:Lingotesplomocarthagonova.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Bars of lead from the mines of New Carthage. Municipal Archaeological Museum of Cartagena]]\nUndoubtedly, the first interest of Rome in Iberia was to take advantage of its legendary mineral wealth, besides that taken from Carthage. After the Second Punic War, the administration of was entrusted to [[Publius Scipio]] 'Africanus', who paid special attention to the mines.  Rome would continue the extraction practices that the Iberian peoples began and that the Carthaginians would improve by importing the techniques used in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nSince the mines were state owned, Rome created companies, 'public societies', which were public businesses administrated by [[publican]]s for mining.  These publicans, generally members of the equestrian order, enriched themselves rapidly and abundantly, but [[Sulla]] snatched the mines from the publicans during his dictatorship in the 80s and 70s BC, putting them in the hands of private individuals and obtaining with it great economic and political benefits.  In the times of Strabo (1st century BC - 1st century AD, during the transition from the Republic to the dictators and the Empire), they were granted as concessions to private exploitation.  This system permitted the rapid enriching of certain families who, coming from Italy, had settled in [[Hispania]] for this purpose.  In other cases, the mines could belong to a city (generally to a colony).  The profits from the mines were huge and remained so throughout the period of seven centuries of Roman rule, which converted Hispania into an economic mainstay of the Empire.  The records show with sufficient accuracy mine production figures, that in the 2nd century BC were more than nine million [[denarius|denarii]] annually, while the spoils of war during the same period, were never more than a little more than a third of this amount.\n\nWith regards to minerals, Rome extracted with greater interest [[silver]], [[copper]], and [[iron]].  Hannibal had had given a great vitality to the silver mines of New Carthage.  In those on the outskirts of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and [[Mazarron]], Rome continued extracting silver, [[lead]], iron, [[zinc]], and other minerals in great quantities, making about 40,000 [[slavery|slaves]] labor in them.  Even today in the region of [[Ilipa]] (the same place where Scipio inflicted a major defeat on the Carthaginians on the west bank of the river [[Guadalquivir|Betis]]) there are significant mineral deposits such as Almaden de la Plata or Aznalcollar in Sevilla, and the Almaden mercury that depended on Sisapo (Valle de Alcudia, Ciudad Real). This production, besides the remains of the same mineral deposits, is demonstrated by the many underwater wrecks in which silver ingots have been found, and lead and copper bars with the seals of Hispanic smelters.\n\nAnother important mineral extracted in Hispania was ''lapis specularis'', a type of translucent [[gypsum]], much appreciated as a mineral for the making, as crystal, [[window]]s in Rome.  Its principal areas of extraction were the current Spanish provinces of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] and [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]].  The city of [[Segobriga]] was the administrative center of the mineral's production, and it was the principle economic activity of the city.\n\nBeyond all of this, the work in the mines in the times of Roman Hispania took place under appalling conditions.  Millions of slaves were employed in mines in extremely dangerous work without any security and without a schedule that is humanly bearable.  For a slave, the fate of the mines was the worst of all fortunes, and with almost complete certainty, a slave was destined to spend the rest of their short lives without seeing the light of the sun again, hauling mineral and stone all day long or swinging a [[pickaxe|pick]] in the galleries, always under the threat of [[cave in]]s.\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nAs soon as the first conquests obtained them, [[Agriculture|cultivated lands]] were divided amongst the professional troops, the land being measured and divided for the colonization of the territory.  Traditionally, farming had been idealized by Roman culture as the culmination of the aspirations of the citizen.  The Romans pushed legislation on land ownership, guaranteeing property lines through surveying techniques and the \"centuriazation\" of the fields.  This policy would allow a rapid colonization of the land.  Subsequently, late in the 2nd century BC, this would produce a crisis for the peasantry throughout the territory under Roman rule, caused by the huge quantity of slaves who were employed in all sectors, with a consequent decline in the competitiveness of small farmers.  The crisis, despite the failed agrarian reform attempts of the Tribunes Tiberius and Cayo Sempronio Graco, would favor the strengthening of the great landowners, possessors of large expanses of land dedicated to cultivation of a single crop and worked by slaves.  The small farmer in many cases would be doomed to abandon his lands and swell the ranks of the growing number of Roman armies.\n\n====Olives and commerce in oil====\n\n[[File:Olivar en Granada.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Olives]] in the province  of [[Granada (province)|Granada]].]]\nOf the agricultural production of Hispania since the 2nd century BC, the cultivation of [[olives]], especially along the Mediterranean coast and Betic Tarragona, stands out.  Under the Romans, the province of B\u00e9tica specialized in the production of olive oil for export to Rome and northern Europe.\n\t\nThe deposits of [[amphorae]] from \"Mount Testaccio\" as much as underwater deposits are evidence of trade with Rome.  Mount Testaccio originated as a dumping ground for ceramic packaging of goods that arrived in Rome. From the size that the hill attained, which according to research, 80% of its volume is composed of Betician amphorae for olive oil, one can deduce the magnitude of the trade generated by the oil and hence the importance that olive cultivation had in Hispania. This was undoubtedly the product of Hispania which was marketed in more abundance and for a longer period of time, and indeed is still the foundation of agriculture in southern Iberia.\n\nAmphorae of Betic origin has been found, besides in Mount Testaccio (since most of the oil production was sent to Rome until the middle of the 3rd century AD), in locations as diverse as Alexandria, and even Israel.  During the 2nd century AD, shipments of oil were destined for the Roman garrisons of Germania.\n\nWithin the oil trade, the quantity of amphorae found, as much in Mount Testaccio as in other places, stands out.  The Sevillian town of [[Lora del Rio]], where one of largest exporters of this product was located, is studied today in the archeological remains of La Catria.  However through the history of Roman Hispania, a multitude of potteries and producers of oil existed in [[Betica]] itself as much as in the area to the east  of it.\n\n====Cultivation of grapevines and commerce in wine====\nWith respect to [[grapevine]] cultivation, classical sources discuss the quality and quantity of Hispanic stock, some of them highly appreciated in Italy, while the production of others less selective were destined to be consumed by the greater public who had less purchasing power.  This crop was produced mostly in the 'fundus' (latifundias), that understood all the processes needed to make [[wine]], occasionally including the manufacture of the [[pottery]] needed for the manufacture of the bottle.  Because of the number of said 'fundus' and the total production of the same, it was possible to keep the domestic market supplied and to export the considerable excess for consumption of other parts of the Empire.\n\n====Treatises of Columella====\nInside the chronicles and treatises concerning agriculture in Hispania, the work of Cadizian [[Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella]] is remarkable.  In his dozen books, he presented the characteristics of agriculture in his time (1st century AD), criticizing those defects that, in his understanding, ruined the industry, like the abandoning of the fields and the hoarding of land by the great landholders.  In these books, he deals extensively with the cultivation of olives and grapevines.\n\n====Trade in salted goods====\n[[File:baelo claudia factoria.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of a factory for salted fish and [[garum]], a Roman sauce.  Located in the ancient Roman city of [[Baelo Claudia]], near [[Tarifa]] in southern Spain.]]\n\nThanks to archeological research about the production of [[amphorae]] in the southern peninsula, it can be deduced that the commerce of salted [[fish]] existed before the control of Carthage.  Evidence exists for production and marketing of salted fish as early as the 5th century BC. The Carthaginians extended this trade throughout all of the western Mediterranean, as much Hispanic as North African.\n\nThroughout the Roman period, Hispania stood out for its continuation of the flourishing trade of salted fish from Betica, extending its market throughout western Europe.  This activity is reflected in the remains of factories whose product was, in addition to salted fish, the sauce [[garum]], whose fame was extended throughout the Empire.  Garum sauce was produced by the process of maceration of fish viscera.  As with the wine and oil trade, the production of garum generated an important auxiliary industry of packaging in amphorae, in which were conserved abundant remains, and thanks to which, it is possible to determine the reach of this trade.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman economy]]\n*[[Hispania]]\n*[[Conquest of Hispania]]\n*[[Romanization of Hispania]]\n*[[Political organization of Hispania]]\n*[[Roman art in Hispania]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n'''The Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library'''\n*[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/00032498673215812725480/p0000001.htm?marca=Estrab%F3n#2 Los Celt\u00edberos] - Alberto J.

Undoubtedly, these stories contributed to the increase in interest of the Mediterranean powers in the Iberian peninsula.\n\n[[File:Utilesesparto.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mining tools from the mines of New Carthage. Municipal Archaeological Museum of Cartagena]]\nAfter their defeat in the [[First Punic War]], [[Carthage]] was overwhelmed by the loss of important markets and by the tribute it had to pay Rome as compensation for the war.  With the goal of alleviating this situation, the Carthagenians decided to expand along the coast of Iberia, which had until then been outside the area of Roman influence.  Carthage, interested above all in getting quick profit, exploited the silver mines along the coastline of [[Andalusia]] and [[Levante, Spain|Levante]], extracting large amounts of this metal with which it financed a great part of the [[Second Punic War]] and [[Hannibal| Hannibal's]] Italian campaign.\n\nWith this purpose and others, one of the first strategic objectives of Rome when invading the peninsula was to take the mines near [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]].  In part due to the loss of these resources, and in greater part due to the isolation he found himself in, Hannibal had to renounce the war in Italy in 206 BC.\n\t\nAfter the expulsion of Carthage, part of the indigenous peoples of Hispania were forced to pay [[tribute]] to Rome through an intricate web of alliances and allegiances. Despite this, throughout the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Rome took the unconquered lands of Hispania as an opportunity to pillage and plunder, frequently breaking peace treaties, like the accords from the times of [[Graccus Sempronius]], which had allowed long periods of peace. The uprising of the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] peoples only served to increase revenues from Rome via the immense spoils of war from the campaigns of [[Cato the Elder]].\n\nThis policy of obtaining riches by force had its continuation in the campaigns of Pompey and later Julius Caesar, whom the histories say undertook not only to fight Pompey, but to profit from the conquest in order pay his creditors.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Spain|Spanish]] Mediterranean coast, which had been conquered during the war against Carthage and rapidly Romanized, began its economic and commercial expansion that would soon make it famous in the Roman world.\n\n==The economy of Romanized Hispania==\nBesides the exploitation of mineral resources, Rome obtained with the conquest of Hispania access to what were probably the best agricultural lands in all of Romanized territory.  Therefore, it became necessary to use those lands as soon as possible.  During the Roman domination of the area, the economy of Hispania experienced a major production expansion, fueled further by roads and [[trade route]]s that opened the markets of the rest of the Empire.\n\n===Circulating currency===\nOne of most obvious symbols of civilization that foreign cultures brought to Hispania was the minting of [[coins]] to facilitate commercial transactions.  Beforehand, the peninsular economy was based on the barter system, exchanging products rather than currency, but beginning in the 3rd century BC, Greek colonies like [[Emp\u00faries|Ampurias]] began minting coins, but with no influence beyond its boundaries.\n\nLater, Carthage would introduce a more general use of the coins as payment for its troops, before and during the Roman invasion; but it would be the Romans who would impose the use of currency throughout the Spanish territory, and not just that currency whose value was based on the metal contained in the coin, but others of lower value than the [[alloy]] that comprised them, and were endorsed by the Roman [[treasury]]. From the abundance of coins found, especially those of lower value, one can draw the conclusion that the money was used widely in everyday life. During expansion of Rome in Spain, many peoples of the Peninsula minted their own coins in order to facilitate payment of tribute and trade with the area under Roman rule.\n\t\nThroughout the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period, it was the [[Roman Senate]] that completely controlled the issuance of coinage through the monetary courts, but later, with the rise of the dictators, its control was reduced to lower valued coins, later passing many of the mints to imperial control.\n\t\nOnce Roman power in Hispania was consolidated, there were many mints that coined money, such as Tarraco (the first of the Roman mints in Hispania), Italica, Barcino, Caesaraugusta, Emerita Augusta, etc.  And throughout the Empire, more than 400 mints provided coinage to most of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\n===Minerals===\n[[File:TEXEO RIOSA ASTURIAS BOCA ROMANA MINAS DE COBRE 002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Entrances to a copper mine in [[Texeo]] ([[Principado de Asturias]]) mined in Roman times.]]\n[[File:Lingotesplomocarthagonova.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Bars of lead from the mines of New Carthage. Municipal Archaeological Museum of Cartagena]]\nUndoubtedly, the first interest of Rome in Iberia was to take advantage of its legendary mineral wealth, besides that taken from Carthage. After the Second Punic War, the administration of was entrusted to [[Publius Scipio]] 'Africanus', who paid special attention to the mines.  Rome would continue the extraction practices that the Iberian peoples began and that the Carthaginians would improve by importing the techniques used in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nSince the mines were state owned, Rome created companies, 'public societies', which were public businesses administrated by [[publican]]s for mining.  These publicans, generally members of the equestrian order, enriched themselves rapidly and abundantly, but [[Sulla]] snatched the mines from the publicans dureing his dictaroship in the 80s and 70s BC, putting them in the hands of private individuals and obtaining with it great economic and political benefits.  In the times of Strabo (1st century BC - 1st century AD, during the transition from the Republic to the dictators and the Empire), they were granted as concessions to private exploitation.  This system permitted the rapid enriching of certain families who, coming from Italy, had settled in [[Hispania]] for this purpose.  In other cases, the mines could belong to a city (generally to a colony).  The profits from the mines were huge and remained so throughout the period of seven centuries of Roman rule, which converted Hispania into an economic mainstay of the Empire.  The records show with sufficient accuracy mine production figures, that in the 2nd century BC were more than nine million [[denarius|denarii]] annually, while the spoils of war during the same period, were never more than a little more than a third of this amount.\n\nWith regards to minerals, Rome extracted with greater interest [[silver]], [[copper]], and [[iron]].  Hannibal had had given a great vitality to the silver mines of New Carthage.  In those on the outskirts of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and [[Mazarron]], Rome continued extracting silver, [[lead]], iron, [[zinc]], and other minerals in great quantities, making about 40,000 [[slavery|slaves]] labor in them.  Even today in the region of [[Ilipa]] (the same place where Scipio inflicted a major defeat on the Carthaginians on the west bank of the river [[Guadalquivir|Betis]]) there are significant mineral deposits such as Almaden de la Plata or Aznalcollar in Sevilla, and the Almaden mercury that depended on Sisapo (Valle de Alcudia, Ciudad Real). This production, besides the remains of the same mineral deposits, is demonstrated by the many underwater wrecks in which silver ingots have been found, and lead and copper bars with the seals of Hispanic smelters.\n\nAnother important mineral extracted in Hispania was ''lapis specularis'', a type of translucent [[gypsum]], much appreciated as a mineral for the making, as crystal, [[window]]s in Rome.  Its principal areas of extraction were the current Spanish provinces of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] and [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]].  The city of [[Segobriga]] was the administrative center of the mineral's production, and it was the principle economic activity of the city.\n\nBeyond all of this, the work in the mines in the times of Roman Hispania took place under appalling conditions.  Millions of slaves were employed in mines in extremely dangerous work without any security and without a schedule that is humanly bearable.  For a slave, the fate of the mines was the worst of all fortunes, and with almost complete certainty, a slave was destined to spend the rest of their short lives without seeing the light of the sun again, hauling mineral and stone all day long or swinging a [[pickaxe|pick]] in the galleries, always under the threat of [[cave in]]s.\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nAs soon as the first conquests obtained them, [[Agriculture|cultivated lands]] were divided amongst the professional troops, the land being measured and divided for the colonization of the territory.  Traditionally, farming had been idealized by Roman culture as the culmination of the aspirations of the citizen.  The Romans pushed legislation on land ownership, guaranteeing property lines through surveying techniques and the \"centuriazation\" of the fields.  This policy would allow a rapid colonization of the land.  Subsequently, late in the 2nd century BC, this would produce a crisis for the peasantry throughout the territory under Roman rule, caused by the huge quantity of slaves who were employed in all sectors, with a consequent decline in the competitiveness of small farmers.  The crisis, despite the failed agrarian reform attempts of the Tribunes Tiberius and Cayo Sempronio Graco, would favor the strengthening of the great landowners, possessors of large expanses of land dedicated to cultivation of a single crop and worked by slaves.  The small farmer in many cases would be doomed to abandon his lands and swell the ranks of the growing number of Roman armies.\n\n====Olives and commerce in oil====\n\n[[File:Olivar en Granada.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Olives]] in the province  of [[Granada (province)|Granada]].]]\nOf the agricultural production of Hispania since the 2nd century BC, the cultivation of [[olives]], especially along the Mediterranean coast and Betic Tarragona, stands out.  Under the Romans, the province of B\u00e9tica specialized in the production of olive oil for export to Rome and northern Europe.\n\t\nThe deposits of [[amphorae]] from \"Mount Testaccio\" as much as underwater deposits are evidence of trade with Rome.  Mount Testaccio originated as a dumping ground for ceramic packaging of goods that arrived in Rome. From the size that the hill attained, which according to research, 80% of its volume is composed of Betician amphorae for olive oil, one can deduce the magnitude of the trade generated by the oil and hence the importance that olive cultivation had in Hispania. This was undoubtedly the product of Hispania which was marketed in more abundance and for a longer period of time, and indeed is still the foundation of agriculture in southern Iberia.\n\nAmphorae of Betic origin has been found, besides in Mount Testaccio (since most of the oil production was sent to Rome until the middle of the 3rd century AD), in locations as diverse as Alexandria, and even Israel.  During the 2nd century AD, shipments of oil were destined for the Roman garrisons of Germania.\n\nWithin the oil trade, the quantity of amphorae found, as much in Mount Testaccio as in other places, stands out.  The Sevillian town of [[Lora del Rio]], where one of largest exporters of this product was located, is studied today in the archeological remains of La Catria.  However through the history of Roman Hispania, a multitude of potteries and producers of oil existed in [[Betica]] itself as much as in the area to the east  of it.\n\n====Cultivation of grapevines and commerce in wine====\nWith respect to [[grapevine]] cultivation, classical sources discuss the quality and quantity of Hispanic stock, some of them highly appreciated in Italy, while the production of others less selective were destined to be consumed by the greater public who had less purchasing power.  This crop was produced mostly in the 'fundus' (latifundias), that understood all the processes needed to make [[wine]], occasionally including the manufacture of the [[pottery]] needed for the manufacture of the bottle.  Because of the number of said 'fundus' and the total production of the same, it was possible to keep the domestic market supplied and to export the considerable excess for consumption of other parts of the Empire.\n\n====Treatises of Columella====\nInside the chronicles and treatises concerning agriculture in Hispania, the work of Cadizian [[Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella]] is remarkable.  In his dozen books, he presented the characteristics of agriculture in his time (1st century AD), criticizing those defects that, in his understanding, ruined the industry, like the abandoning of the fields and the hoarding of land by the great landholders.  In these books, he deals extensively with the cultivation of olives and grapevines.\n\n====Trade in salted goods====\n[[File:baelo claudia factoria.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of a factory for salted fish and [[garum]], a Roman sauce.  Located in the ancient Roman city of [[Baelo Claudia]], near [[Tarifa]] in southern Spain.]]\n\nThanks to archeological research about the production of [[amphorae]] in the southern peninsula, it can be deduced that the commerce of salted [[fish]] existed before the control of Carthage.  Evidence exists for production and marketing of salted fish as early as the 5th century BC. The Carthaginians extended this trade throughout all of the western Mediterranean, as much Hispanic as North African.\n\nThroughout the Roman period, Hispania stood out for its continuation of the flourishing trade of salted fish from Betica, extending its market throughout western Europe.  This activity is reflected in the remains of factories whose product was, in addition to salted fish, the sauce [[garum]], whose fame was extended throughout the Empire.  Garum sauce was produced by the process of maceration of fish viscera.  As with the wine and oil trade, the production of garum generated an important auxiliary industry of packaging in amphorae, in which were conserved abundant remains, and thanks to which, it is possible to determine the reach of this trade.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman economy]]\n*[[Hispania]]\n*[[Conquest of Hispania]]\n*[[Romanization of Hispania]]\n*[[Political organization of Hispania]]\n*[[Roman art in Hispania]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n'''The Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library'''\n*[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/00032498673215812725480/p0000001.htm?marca=Estrab%F3n#2 Los Celt\u00edberos] - Alberto J.

Starting in the mid-1990s, the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from [[biotechnology]] research, such as [[cancer immunotherapy]] and [[gene therapy]].\n\nCancer research is done in academia, research institutes, and corporate environments, and is largely government funded.\n\n== History ==\nCancer research has been ongoing for centuries.

Early cancer treatment focused on improving surgical techniques for removing tumors. Radiation therapy took hold in the 1900s. Chemotherapeutics were developed and refined throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe U.S. declared a \"[[War on Cancer]]\" in the 1970s, and increased the funding and support for cancer research.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dtp.cancer.gov/timeline/flash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm|title=Milestone (1971): President Nixon declares war on cancer|website=dtp.cancer.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203021720/https://dtp.cancer.gov/timeline/flash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm|archivedate=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Seminal papers ===\nSome of the most highly cited and most influential research reports include:\n\n*''[[The Hallmarks of Cancer]]'', published in 2000, and ''Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation'', published in 2011, by [[Douglas Hanahan]] and [[Robert Weinberg]]. Together, these articles have been cited in over 30,000 published papers.\n\n== Types of research ==\nCancer research encompasses a variety of types and interdisciplinary areas of research. Scientists involved in cancer research may be trained in areas such as [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[physiology]], [[medical physics]], [[epidemiology]], and [[biomedical engineering]]. Research performed on a foundational level is referred to as [[basic research]] and is intended to clarify scientific principles and mechanisms. [[Translational research]] aims to elucidate mechanisms of cancer development and progression and transform basic scientific findings into concepts that can be applicable to the treatment and prevention of cancer. [[Clinical research]] is devoted to the development of pharmaceuticals, surgical procedures, and medical technologies for the eventual treatment of patients.\n\n=== Prevention and epidemiology ===\n\n=== Cause and development of cancer ===\n[[File:Signal transduction v1.png|thumb|350px|Numerous [[cell signaling]] pathways are disrupted in the development of cancer.]]\n\nResearch into the cause of cancer involves many different disciplines including genetics, diet, environmental factors (i.e. chemical [[carcinogens]]).  In regard to investigation of causes and potential targets for therapy, the route used starts with data obtained from clinical observations, enters basic research, and, once convincing and independently confirmed results are obtained, proceeds with clinical research, involving appropriately designed trials on consenting human subjects, with the aim to test safety and efficiency of the therapeutic intervention method.\nAn important part of basic research is characterization of the potential mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in regard to the types of genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with cancer development. The mouse is often used as a mammalian model for manipulation of the function of genes that play a role in tumor formation, while basic aspects of tumor initiation, such as mutagenesis, are assayed on cultures of bacteria and mammalian cells.\n\n==== Genes involved in cancer ====\n{{main|Oncogenomics}}\n\n{{See also|Databases for oncogenomic research}}The goal of [[oncogenomics]] is to identify new [[oncogenes]] or [[tumor suppressor genes]] that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical outcome of cancers, and new targets for cancer therapies. As the [[Cancer Genome Project]] stated in a 2004 review article, \"a central aim of cancer research has been to identify the mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis (''cancer genes'').\"<ref name=\"pmid14993899\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Futreal PA, Coin L, Marshall M, Down T, Hubbard T, Wooster R, Rahman N, Stratton MR | title = A census of human cancer genes | journal = Nat.

The majority occurred in 319 genes, of which 286 were [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and 33 [[oncogene]]s.\n\nSeveral hereditary factors can increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of [[oncogene]]s or the inhibition of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s. The functions of various onco- and tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted at different stages of tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor. <!-- What does this last sentence mean?/! -->\n\nIn later stages, tumors can develop a resistance to cancer treatment. The identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important to understand tumor progression and treatment success. The role of a given gene in cancer progression may vary tremendously, depending on the stage and type of cancer involved.<ref>Vlahopoulos SA, Logotheti S, Mikas D, Giarika A, Gorgoulis V, Zoumpourlis V.The role of ATF-2 in oncogenesis\" ''Bioessays'' 2008 Apr;30(4) 314-27.</ref>\n\n===Detection===\nPrompt detection of cancer is important, since it is usually more difficult to treat in later stages.  Accurate detection of cancer is also important because false positives can cause harm from unnecessary medical procedures.  Some screening protocols are currently not accurate (such as [[prostate-specific antigen]] testing).  Others such as a [[colonoscopy]] or [[mammogram]] are unpleasant and as a result some patients may opt out.  Active research is underway to address all these problems.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Treatment ===\n{{main|Treatment of cancer}}\n<!--- break this section down into:\n==== Surgical research ====\n==== Chemotherapy ====\n==== Targeted therapy ====\n==== Radiation ====\n==== Other advances(?) ====\n--->\n\nEmerging topics of cancer treatment research include:\n\n*[[Cancer vaccine|Anti-cancer vaccines]]\n**[[Oncophage]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antigenics.com/product/oncophage.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216083916/http://www.antigenics.com/product/oncophage.shtml |archivedate=2010-12-16 }}</ref>\n**[[Sipuleucel-T]] (Provenge) is a prostate cancer vaccine\n* Newer forms of [[chemotherapy]]\n*[[Gene therapy]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Gene Therapy, Cancer-Killing Viruses And New Drugs Highlight Novel Approaches To Cancer Treatment | work=Medical News Today | url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=68204 | accessdate=April 24, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=World first gene therapy trial for leukaemia | work=LLR | url=http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/research/achievements/new-treatments-blood-cancers | accessdate=July 23, 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802091406/http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/research/achievements/new-treatments-blood-cancers | archivedate=August 2, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-to-pioneer-first-human-crispr-trial-1.20302 Chinese scientists to pioneer first human CRISPR trial]</ref>\n*[[Photodynamic therapy]]\n*[[Radiation therapy]]\n*[[Reoviridae]] (Reolysin drug therapy)\n*[[Targeted therapy]]\n*[[Natural killer cell]]s can induce [[immunological memory]].<ref name=\"CerwenkaLanier2016\" /> Research is being developed to modify their action against cancer.<ref name=\"CerwenkaLanier2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Cerwenka|first1=Adelheid|last2=Lanier|first2=Lewis L.|title=Natural killer cell memory in infection, inflammation and cancer|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|volume=16|issue=2|year=2016|pages=112\u2013123|issn=1474-1733|doi=10.1038/nri.2015.9|pmid=26806484|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2qj442xk}}</ref>\n\n== Research funding ==\nCancer research is funded by government grants, charitable foundations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asco.org/advocacy-policy/policies-positions-guidance/federally-funded-cancer-research|title=Federally Funded Cancer Research|date=8 February 2016|website=asco.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423174847/https://www.asco.org/advocacy-policy/policies-positions-guidance/federally-funded-cancer-research|archivedate=23 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, most funding for cancer research came from taxpayers and charities, rather than from corporations.

Early research focused on the causes of cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-causes-theories-throughout-history.html|title=Early Theories about Cancer Causes \u2013 American Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509202956/https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-causes-theories-throughout-history.html|archivedate=9 May 2018}}</ref> [[Percivall Pott]] identified the first environmental trigger (chimney soot) for cancer in 1775 and cigarette smoking was identified as a cause of lung cancer in 1950. Early cancer treatment focused on improving surgical techniques for removing tumors. Radiation therapy took hold in the 1900s. Chemotherapeutics were developed and refined throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe U.S. declared a \"[[War on Cancer]]\" in the 1970s, and increased the funding and support for cancer research.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dtp.cancer.gov/timeline/flash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm|title=Milestone (1971): President Nixon declares war on cancer|website=dtp.cancer.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203021720/https://dtp.cancer.gov/timeline/flash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm|archivedate=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Seminal papers ===\nSome of the most highly-cited and most influential research reports include:\n\n*''[[The Hallmarks of Cancer]]'', published in 2000, and ''Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation'', published in 2011, by [[Douglas Hanahan]] and [[Robert Weinberg]]. Together, these articles have been cited in over 30,000 published papers.\n\n== Types of research ==\nCancer research encompasses a variety of types and interdisciplinary areas of research. Scientists involved in cancer research may be trained in areas such as [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[physiology]], [[medical physics]], [[epidemiology]], and [[biomedical engineering]]. Research performed on a foundational level is referred to as [[basic research]] and is intended to clarify scientific principles and mechanisms. [[Translational research]] aims to elucidate mechanisms of cancer development and progression and transform basic scientific findings into concepts that can be applicable to the treatment and prevention of cancer. [[Clinical research]] is devoted to the development of pharmaceuticals, surgical procedures, and medical technologies for the eventual treatment of patients.\n\n=== Prevention and epidemiology ===\n\n=== Cause and development of cancer ===\n[[File:Signal transduction v1.png|thumb|350px|Numerous [[cell signaling]] pathways are disrupted in the development of cancer.]]\n\nResearch into the cause of cancer involves many different disciplines including genetics, diet, environmental factors (i.e. chemical [[carcinogens]]).  In regard to investigation of causes and potential targets for therapy, the route used starts with data obtained from clinical observations, enters basic research, and, once convincing and independently confirmed results are obtained, proceeds with clinical research, involving appropriately designed trials on consenting human subjects, with the aim to test safety and efficiency of the therapeutic intervention method.\nAn important part of basic research is characterization of the potential mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in regard to the types of genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with cancer development. The mouse is often used as a mammalian model for manipulation of the function of genes that play a role in tumor formation, while basic aspects of tumor initiation, such as mutagenesis, are assayed on cultures of bacteria and mammalian cells.\n\n==== Genes involved in cancer ====\n{{main|Oncogenomics}}\n\n{{See also|Databases for oncogenomic research}}The goal of [[oncogenomics]] is to identify new [[oncogenes]] or [[tumor suppressor genes]] that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical outcome of cancers, and new targets for cancer therapies. As the [[Cancer Genome Project]] stated in a 2004 review article, \"a central aim of cancer research has been to identify the mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis (''cancer genes'').\"<ref name=\"pmid14993899\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Futreal PA, Coin L, Marshall M, Down T, Hubbard T, Wooster R, Rahman N, Stratton MR | title = A census of human cancer genes | journal = Nat.

The majority occurred in 319 genes, of which 286 were [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and 33 [[oncogene]]s.\n\nSeveral hereditary factors can increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of [[oncogene]]s or the inhibition of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s. The functions of various onco- and tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted at different stages of tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor. <!-- What does this last sentence mean?/! -->\n\nIn later stages, tumors can develop a resistance to cancer treatment. The identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important to understand tumor progression and treatment success. The role of a given gene in cancer progression may vary tremendously, depending on the stage and type of cancer involved.<ref>Vlahopoulos SA, Logotheti S, Mikas D, Giarika A, Gorgoulis V, Zoumpourlis V.The role of ATF-2 in oncogenesis\" ''Bioessays'' 2008 Apr;30(4) 314-27.</ref>\n\n===Detection===\nPrompt detection of cancer is important, since it is usually more difficult to treat in later stages.  Accurate detection of cancer is also important because false positives can cause harm from unnecessary medical procedures.  Some screening protocols are currently not accurate (such as [[prostate-specific antigen]] testing).  Others such as a [[colonoscopy]] or [[mammogram]] are unpleasant and as a result some patients may opt out.  Active research is underway to address all these problems.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Treatment ===\n{{main|Treatment of cancer}}\n<!--- break this section down into:\n==== Surgical research ====\n==== Chemotherapy ====\n==== Targeted therapy ====\n==== Radiation ====\n==== Other advances(?) ====\n--->\n\nEmerging topics of cancer treatment research include:\n\n*[[Cancer vaccine|Anti-cancer vaccines]]\n**[[Oncophage]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antigenics.com/product/oncophage.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216083916/http://www.antigenics.com/product/oncophage.shtml |archivedate=2010-12-16 }}</ref>\n**[[Sipuleucel-T]] (Provenge) is a prostate cancer vaccine\n* Newer forms of [[chemotherapy]]\n*[[Gene therapy]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Gene Therapy, Cancer-Killing Viruses And New Drugs Highlight Novel Approaches To Cancer Treatment | work=Medical News Today | url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=68204 | accessdate=April 24, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=World first gene therapy trial for leukaemia | work=LLR | url=http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/research/achievements/new-treatments-blood-cancers | accessdate=July 23, 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802091406/http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/research/achievements/new-treatments-blood-cancers | archivedate=August 2, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-to-pioneer-first-human-crispr-trial-1.20302 Chinese scientists to pioneer first human CRISPR trial]</ref>\n*[[Photodynamic therapy]]\n*[[Radiation therapy]]\n*[[Reoviridae]] (Reolysin drug therapy)\n*[[Targeted therapy]]\n*[[Natural killer cell]]s can induce [[immunological memory]].<ref name=\"CerwenkaLanier2016\" /> Research is being developed to modify their action against cancer.<ref name=\"CerwenkaLanier2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Cerwenka|first1=Adelheid|last2=Lanier|first2=Lewis L.|title=Natural killer cell memory in infection, inflammation and cancer|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|volume=16|issue=2|year=2016|pages=112\u2013123|issn=1474-1733|doi=10.1038/nri.2015.9|pmid=26806484|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2qj442xk}}</ref>\n\n== Research funding ==\nCancer research is funded by government grants, charitable foundations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asco.org/advocacy-policy/policies-positions-guidance/federally-funded-cancer-research|title=Federally Funded Cancer Research|date=8 February 2016|website=asco.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423174847/https://www.asco.org/advocacy-policy/policies-positions-guidance/federally-funded-cancer-research|archivedate=23 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, most funding for cancer research came from taxpayers and charities, rather than from corporations.
