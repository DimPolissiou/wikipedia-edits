Due to immigration and [[language shift]] in urban areas, around 15\u201320% of [[Demographics of Greenland#Ethnic groups|the population]] of [[Greenland]] speak Danish as their [[first language]].\n\nAlong with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] who lived in [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]]. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the [[Middle Norwegian]] language before the influence of Danish and [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]] are classified as West Norse along with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. A more recent classification based on [[mutual intelligibility]] separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as \"mainland Scandinavian\", while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as \"insular Scandinavian\".\n\nUntil the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to [[Scania]] with no [[standard language|standard variety]] or spelling conventions. With the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[History of printing|introduction of printing]], a standard language was developed which was based on the educated [[Copenhagen]] dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration, though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity, with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional [[Danish dialects]] have all but disappeared, though regional variants of the standard language exist. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.\n\nDanish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 [[phonemes|phonemically distinctive]] [[vowel]]s,{{sfn|Haberland|1994|page=318}} and its [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', a kind of [[glottal consonant|laryngeal phonation type]]. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and \"weakly\" pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a \"difficult language to learn, acquire and understand\",{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008a}} and some evidence shows that children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish compared to other languages.{{sfn|Trecca|2015}} The grammar is moderately [[Fusional language|inflective]] with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. Like English, Danish only has remnants of a former [[grammatical case|case system]], particularly in the pronouns. Unlike English, it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is [[V2 word order]], with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:North Germanic languages.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Danish and its historical relationships to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European. [[North_Germanic_languages#Classification|Another classification]] can be drawn based on mutual intellegibility.]]\nDanish is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] of the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic branch]]. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the [[Old Norse language]]; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|pp=809-10}}\n\nScandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where no sharp dividing lines are seen between the different vernacular languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nLike Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nDanish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), [[Insular Danish]] (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including [[Bornholmsk dialect|Bornholmian]] and [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]]). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\n=== Mutual intelligibility ===\nDanish is largely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}} The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=70-72}} Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general, younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Danish}}\nThe Danish philologist [[Johannes Br\u00f8ndum-Nielsen]] divided the history of Danish into a period from 800 AD to 1525 to be \"Old Danish\", which he subdivided into \"Runic Danish\" (800-1100), Early Middle Danish (1100\u20131350) and Late Middle Danish (1350\u20131525).{{sfn|Howe|1996}}\n\n{{Anchor|Runic Danish: D\u01ebnsk tunga}}\n\n=== Runic Danish===\n{{Main|Old Norse}}{{Old Norse language map}}\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu''.<br /> \"[[Dyggvi]]'s mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, [[R\u00edgs\u00feula|R\u00edg]]'s son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\"\n|source= ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Ynglinga_saga|title=Ynglinga saga \u2013 heimskringla.no|website=www.heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n}}\nBy the eighth century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into [[Old Norse]].\nThis language was generally called the \"Danish tongue\" (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), or \"Norse language\" (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''). Norse was written in the [[runic alphabet]], first with the [[elder futhark]] and from the 9th century with the [[younger futhark]].{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=38-41}}\n\nFrom the seventh century, the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and Old East Norse ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=39}} A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''\u00e6i'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''st\u00e6in'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. Also, a change of ''au'' as in ''dau\u00f0r'' into ''\u00f8'' as in ''d\u00f8\u00f0r'' occurred. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tau\u00fer'' into ''tu\u00fer''. Moreover, the ''\u00f8y'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''\u00f8'', as well, as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=41}}\n\nThrough Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the [[Danelaw|northeast counties of England]]. Many words derived from Norse, such as \"gate\" ({{wiktda|gade}}) for street, still survive in [[Yorkshire]], the East Midlands and East Anglia, and [[Danelaw|parts of eastern England]] colonized by Danish [[Vikings]]. The city of [[York]] was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example \"knife\" ({{wiktda|kniv}}), \"husband\" ({{wiktda|husbond}}), and \"egg\" ({{wiktda|\u00e6g}}). The suffix \"-by\" for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby, and Grimsby.

The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish-language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The [[Codex Holmiensis|Jutlandic Law]] and [[Scanian Law]] were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration, and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=219\u201321}}\n\nThroughout this period, Danish was in contact with [[Low German language|Low German]], and many Low German loan words were introduced in this period.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=221\u2013224}} With the [[Protestant Reformation in Denmark|Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. Also in this period, Danish began to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=57-58}}\n\nThe first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the ''Rimkr\u00f8niken'' (''Rhyming Chronicle''), a history book told in rhymed verses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|publisher=Royal Danish Library|title=Bog Museum (Book Museum)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221182726/http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by [[Christiern Pedersen]], was published in 1550.

In the second half of the 17th century, grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them [[Rasmus Bartholin]]'s 1657 Latin grammar ''De studio lingv\u00e6 danic\u00e6''; then [[Laurids Olufsen Kock]]'s 1660 grammar of the [[Zealand]] dialect ''Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam''; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, ''Den Danske Sprog-Kunst'' (\"The Art of the Danish Language\") by [[Peder Syv]]. Major authors from this period are [[Thomas Kingo]], poet and psalmist, and [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], whose novel ''Jammersminde'' (''Remembered Woes'') is considered a literary masterpiece by scholars. [[Orthography]] was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of [[Jens Pedersen H\u00f8ysgaard]] was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the ''st\u00f8d''. In this period, scholars were also discussing whether it was best to \"write as one speaks\" or to \"speak as one writes\", including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. ''han er'' \"he is\" vs. ''de ere'' \"they are\").{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\nThe East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)]] after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, beginning also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the [[History of Denmark#Absolutism|introduction of absolutism]] in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the Danish chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the ''de facto'' [[Lingua franca|official standard language]], especially in writing \u2014 this was the original so-called ''rigsdansk'' (\"Danish of the Realm\"). Also beginning in the mid-18th century, the ''skarre-R'', the [[Guttural R|uvular R]] sound ({{IPA|[\u0281]}}), began spreading through Denmark, likely through influence from [[Parisian French]] and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden, and coastal southern Norway.{{sfn|Torp|2006|p=52}}\n\nIn the 18th century, Danish philology was advanced by [[Rasmus Rask]], who pioneered the disciplines of [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] and [[Historical linguistics|historical]] linguistics, and wrote the first English-language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish continued to develop with the works of [[Ludvig Holberg]], whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by [[Hans Egede]], Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language until the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\n=== Standardized national language ===\n{{Quote box |width=250px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,<br /> kun l\u00f8s er al fremmed Tale.<br /> Det alene i mund og bog,<br /> kan v\u00e6kke et folk af dvale.''<br /> \"Mother's name is our hearts' tongue,<br /> only idle is all foreign speech<br /> It alone, in mouth or in book,<br /> can rouse a people from sleep.\"\n|source= [[N.F.S.

The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called \"[[Danish Golden Age|Golden Age]]\" of Danish culture. Authors such as [[N.F.S. Grundtvig]] emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish-language authors of this period are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=828}} The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|Schleswig referendum in 1920]], a number of Danes remained as a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|minority within German territories]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=831}} Throughout the 19th century, Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina, where memory and some use of Danish remains today.\n\n[[File:LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png|thumb|right|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in southern [[Schleswig]]]]\nAfter the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German-influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter \u00c5/\u00e5. Three 20th-century Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup|Karl Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in 1917) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V. Jensen]] (awarded 1944).\n\nWith the exclusive use of ''rigsdansk'', the High Copenhagenian Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century, they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.{{sfn|Pedersen|2003}} Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called ''regionssprog'' (\"regional languages\") remain, and are in some cases vital. Today, the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do, and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.{{sf|Kristiansen|J\u00f8rgensen|2003}}<ref>Quist, P.

Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as ''lingua franca'', and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speaks Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English, Iceland was a ruled territory of [[Denmark-Norway]], where Danish was one of the official languages.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2003}}\n\n[[File:Learn Danish in Germany, 2012, ubt.JPG|thumb|''Learn Danish'' banner in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]]]]\nIn addition, a noticeable community of Danish speakers is in [[Southern Schleswig]], the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]], just as [[German language|German]] is north of the border.

Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, which has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.{{sfn|Pedersen|2003}}{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nDanish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects.

Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to [[Sweden]] and subsequently swedified.\n\nTraditional dialects differ in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of ''st\u00f8d''.{{sfn|S\u00f8rensen|2011}} Four main regional variants for the realization of st\u00f8d are known: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland, and \u00c6r\u00f8, no ''st\u00f8d'' is used, but instead a [[pitch accent]]. South of a line ({{lang-da|St\u00f8dgr\u00e6nsen}} \"The St\u00f8d border\") going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, M\u00f8n, Southern Zealand and Bornholm neither ''st\u00f8d'' nor pitch accent exists.<ref name=\"dialekt\">{{cite web |url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/stoed/ |title=St\u00f8d |publisher=University of Copenhagen, Center for Dialect Studies |date=22 April 2015 }}</ref> Most of Jutland and on Zealand use'' st\u00f8d'', and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language,'' st\u00f8d'' occurs more often than in the standard language. In Zealand, the ''st\u00f8d'' line divides Southern Zealand (without ''st\u00f8d''), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.{{sfn|Ejskj\u00e6r|1990}}{{sfn|Kroman|1980}}\n\nGrammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of [[suffix]]es, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as [[West Germanic languages]]. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three [[grammatical gender]]s.{{sfn|Prince|1924}} Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900, Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.{{sfn|Arboe|2008}} Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: \"Katti, han f\u00e5r unger\", literally ''The cat, he is having kittens'', because cat is a masculine noun, thus is referred to as ''han'' (he), even if it is female cat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/navneordenes_koen/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=Navneordenes k\u00f8n|date=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n[[File:Michael Noer - voice - da.flac|thumb|Spoken Danish]]\n{{Main|Danish phonology}}\n\nThe sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech, the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment{{clarify|date=August 2018}} the speech flow into its constituent elements.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008a}}{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008b}} These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and Danish children are indicated to take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.{{sfn|Trecca|2015}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nAlthough somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels, and two ''schwa'' vowels, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u0250/}} that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes \u2013 a very large number among the world's languages.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=319}} At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, {{IPA|[u\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|[\u0250\u032f]}}.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}} The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by {{Harvcoltxt|Gr\u00f8nnum|1998}} in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in [[Help:IPA/Danish|IPA/Danish]].

In syllable onset the phonemes {{IPA|/b d \u0261 v j r/}} are [[contoid]] (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become [[vocoid]]s, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, l\u00f8b/ (\"grave, ran\") are pronounced {{IPA|[grau\u032f, l\u00f8u\u032f]}}.\n\n{{IPA|[\u028b, \u00f0]}} often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as [[approximant]]s. Danish {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar [[approximant]] which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] by second language learners.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}}\n\nThe sound {{IPA|[\u0255]}} is found for example in the word /sjov\u02c0/ \"fun\" pronounced {{IPA|[\u0255\u0252u\u032f\u02c0]}} and /tjal\u02c0/ \"marijuana\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0255al\u02c0]}}. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|[j]}} doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/j/}}, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a {{IPA|/\u0255/}}-phoneme in Danish.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gr\u00f8nnum|2005|pp=305\u2013306}}</ref>\n\nIn onset {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as a [[voiced uvular fricative|uvu-pharyngeal approximant]], {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic [[near-open central vowel|low central vowel]], {{IPA|[\u0250\u032f]}} or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the ''r'' in German or in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\n=== Prosody ===\nDanish is characterized by a [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature called ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' (lit. \"thrust\"). This is a form of laryngealization or [[creaky voice]]. Some sources have described it as a [[glottal stop]], but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989}} It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in [[minimal pair]]s such as ''b\u00f8nder'' (\"peasants\") with st\u00f8d, versus ''b\u00f8nner'' (\"beans\") without st\u00f8d. The distribution of st\u00f8d in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian [[pitch accent]]s found in most dialects of [[Norwegian phonology#Accent|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|Swedish]].{{sfn| Basb\u00f8ll|2005|pp=83-86}}\n\n[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is phonemic and distinguishes words such as ''billigst'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bilist]}} \"cheapest\" and ''bilist'' {{IPA|[bi\u02c8list]}} \"car driver\".{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=811}}\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Danish grammar}}\n\nSimilarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] pattern with a rich [[inflection]]al morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly [[Analytic language|analytic]] pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed [[SVO word order]] and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] or [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''tager/tog'' (\"takes/took\") and ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' (\"foot/feet\")) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''elsker/elskede'' \"love/loved\", ''bil/biler'' \"car/cars\"). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=17}}\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an [[enclitic]]. A distinctive feature of the Nordic languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or \"[[strong inflection|strong]]\" stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' \"foot/feet\", ''mand/m\u00e6nd'' \"man/men\") or \"weak\" stems inflected through affixation (e.g. ''skib/skibe'' \"ship/ships\", ''kvinde/kvinder'' \"woman/women\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=323-331}}\n\n==== Gender ====\n{{Main|Gender in Danish and Swedish}}\nStandard Danish has two [[Grammatical gender|nominal genders]]: ''common'' and ''neuter''; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the ''common'' gender, and ''neuter'' is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}}\n\n==== Definiteness ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish regular plural patterns\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 1\n! colspan=\"3\"|Class 2\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 3\n|-\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n|-\n|''m\u00e5ned''<br />month||''m\u00e5neder''<br />months||''m\u00e5nederne''<br />the months||''dag''<br />day||''dage''<br /> days||''dagene''<br />\"the days\"||''\u00e5r'' <br />year||''\u00e5r''<br />years ||''\u00e5rene'' <br /> the years\n|-\n|''bil''<br />car||''biler''<br />cars||''bilerne''<br />the cars||''hund''<br />dog||''hunde''<br />dogs||''hundene''<br />the dogs||''fisk''<br />fish||''fisk''<br />fish (pl.)||''fiskene''<br />the fishes\n|-\n|}\nDefiniteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} Neuter nouns take the clitic ''-et'', and common gender nouns take ''-en''. Indefinite nouns take the articles ''en'' (common gender) or ''et'' (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun ''en mand'' \"a man\" (indefinite) has the definite form ''manden'' \"the man\", whereas the neuter noun ''et hus'' \"a house\" (indefinite) has the definite form, \"the house\" (definite) ''huset''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}} {{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\nIndefinite:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''et''' hus''\n:\"I saw a house\"\n\nDefinite with enclitic article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 hus'''et'''''\n:\"I saw the house\"\n\nDefinite with preposed demonstrative article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''det''' store hus''<ref group='nb'>Note here that in Swedish and Norwegian the preposed and the enclitic article occur together (e.g. ''det store huset''), whereas in Danish the enclitic article is replaced by the preposed demonstrative.</ref>\n:\"I saw the big house\"\n\nThe plural definite ending is ''-(e)ne'' (e.g. ''drenge'' \"boys > ''drengene'' \"the boys\" and ''piger'' \"girls\" > ''pigerne'' \"the girls\"), and nouns ending in -''ere'' lose the last ''-e'' before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. ''danskere'' \"Danes\" > ''danskerne'' \"the Danes\"). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article ''den'' (common) or ''det'' (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: ''den store mand'' \"the big man\", ''det store hus'' \"the big house\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=330}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==== Number ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish irregular plurals\n|-\n!

Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of ''\u00f8je'' \"eye\", which is the old dual form ''\u00f8jne''), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word ''konto'' \"account\" which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form ''konti'' \"accounts\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=35-40}}\n\n==== Possession ====\nPossessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -''s'', for example ''min fars hus'' \"my father's house\" where the noun ''far'' carries the possessive enclitic.{{sfn|Herslund|2001}} This is however not an example of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases ''kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik'' \"the king of Denmark's candy factory\", or ''det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter'' \"that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with\", where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=325}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=53-60}}\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Person\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Objective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Dependent<br /> possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Independent <br />possessive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. sg.\n| ''jeg'' <br /> I || ''mig''<br /> me || ''min/mit''<br /> my || ''mine''<br /> mine\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd o. sg.\n| ''du'' <br /> You || ''dig''<br /> you|| ''din/dit''<br /> your || ''dine''<br /> yours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. sg.\n| ''han/hun<br />/den/det'' <br /> he/she/it|| ''ham/hende<br />/den/det''<br /> him/her/it|| ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/her/its||  ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/hers/its\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. pl.\n| ''vi''<br />we || ''os''<br /> us || ''vores''<br />our || ''vores''<br />ours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. pl.\n| ''I''<br /> you (pl.) || ''jer'' <br /> you (pl.) || ''jeres''<br /> your (pl.)|| ''jeres''<br /> yours (pl.)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. pl\n| ''de'' <br /> they|| ''dem''<br /> them || ''deres''<br /> their || ''deres''<br /> theirs\n|}\nAs does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (''han'' \"he\"), animate feminine (''hun'' \"she\") forms, as well as inanimate neuter (''det'' \"it\") and inanimate common gender (''den'' \"it\") {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326-328}}\n\n:''Jeg sover''\n:\"I sleep\"\n\n:''Du sover''\n:\"you sleep\"\n\n:''Jeg kysser dig''\n:\"I kiss you\"\n\n:''Du kysser mig''\n:\"you kiss me\"\n\nPossessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (''det er min hest'' \"it is my horse\"), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (''den er min'' \"it is mine\"). In the third person singular ''sin'' is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas ''hans'' (\"his\"), ''hendes'' (her) and ''dens/dets'' \"its\" is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.{{sfn|Allan|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2005|p=63}}{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=83-85}}\n\n:''Han tog '''sin''' hat''\n:He took his (own) hat\n\n:''Han tog '''hans''' hat''\n:He took his hat (someone else's hat)\n\n==== Nominal compounds ====\nLike all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in ''kvindeh\u00e5ndboldlandsholdet'', \"the female national handball team\". In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra ''s'', originally possessive in function, like ''landsmand'' (from ''land'', \"country\", and ''mand'', \"man\", meaning \"compatriot\"), but ''landmand'' (from same roots, meaning \"farmer\"). Some words are joined with an extra ''e'', like ''g\u00e6stebog'' (from ''g\u00e6st'' and ''bog'', meaning \"guest book\").\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish verbal forms|-\n! infinitive\n!

They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=331}}\n\n{{Anchor|Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice}}\n\n==== Tense, aspect, mood, and voice ====\nVerbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -''te'' and those that take the suffix -''ede''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}}\n\nThe infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), infinitive forms are preceded by the article ''at'' (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0252]}}).{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}} The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -''r'', except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}\n\nThe present participle ends in -''ende'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bende'' \"running\"), and the past participle ends in -''et'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bet'' \"run\"), ''-t'' (e.g. k\u00f8bt \"bought\"). [[Perfect_(grammar)|Perfect tense]] is constructed with ''at have'' (\"to have\") and participial forms, like in English. But some transitive verbs can also form an [[Imperfective|imperfective]] perfect using ''at v\u00e6re'' (\"to be\") instead.\n\n: ''Hun har g\u00e5et''. ''Flyet har fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She has walked''. ''The plane has flown''\n\n: ''Hun er g\u00e5et''. ''Flyet er fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She has left''.

''Flyet var fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She had left''. ''The plane had taken off''\n\nThe passive form takes the suffix -s: ''avisen l\u00e6ses hver dag'' (\"the newspaper is read every day\"). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb ''at blive'' \"to become\": ''avisen bliver l\u00e6st hver dag''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=814}}\n\nThe imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:\n:''l\u00f8b!''\n:\"run!\"\n\n=== Syntax ===\nDanish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|Subject\u2013Verb\u2013Object]].{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=24}} However, Danish is also a [[V2 word order|V2 language]], which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian [[Paul Diderichsen]]{{sfn|Diderichsen|1974}} Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or \"grounding\") field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or [[Topic and comment|topics]]. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\n:''Peter (S) s\u00e5 (V) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nbut\n\n:''I g\u00e5r s\u00e5 (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nWhen there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a [[Dummy pronoun|dummy subject]] \"der\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=344}}\n\n:''der kom en pige ind ad d\u00f8ren''\n:there came a girl in through the door\n:\"A girl came in the door\"\n\n==== Main clauses ====\n{{Harvtxt|Haberland|1994|p=336}} describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|''Og''||''ham''||''havde''||''Per''||''ikke''||''sk\u00e6nket''||''en tanke''||''i \u00e5revis''\n|-\n|And||him||had||Per||not||given||a thought||for years\n|-\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7\n|-\n|colspan=\"8\" | \"And him Per hadn't given a thought in years\"\n\n|}\n\nPosition 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\nQuestions with [[Interrogative word|wh-words]] are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.\n\nWh-question:\n:''hvem s\u00e5 hun?'''\n: whom saw she\n:\"whom did she see?\"\n\n:''s\u00e5 hun ham?''\n:saw she him?\n:\"did she see him?\"\n\n==== Subordinate clauses ====\nIn subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).{{sfn|Jensen|2011}} [[Complement clause]]s begin with the particle ''at'' in the \"connector field\".\n\n:''Han sagde '''at han ikke ville g\u00e5'''''\n:he said that he not would go\n:\"He said that he did not want to go\"\n\n[[Relative clause]]s are marked by the relative articles ''som'' or ''der'' which occupy the preverbal slot:\n\n:''Jeg kender en mand '''som''' bor i Helsing\u00f8r{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=345}}\n:\"I know a man who lives in Elsinore\"\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Danish military police Mercedes.JPG|thumb|Danish label reading ''milit\u00e6rpoliti,'' \"military police\", on police vehicle]]\nAbout 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the [[Old Norse language]], and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]]. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=346-347}} Danish has also absorbed a large number of [[loan words]], most of which were borrowed from [[Middle Low German]] in the [[late medieval]] period. Out of the 500 most frequently used words in Danish, 100 are medieval loans from Middle Low German, as Low German is the other official language of Denmark-Norway.<ref name=Sproget>{{cite web|url=http://sproget.dk/raad-og-regler/artikler-mv/svarbase/SV00001479|title=Antal arveord og l\u00e5neord|first=Anita \u00c5gerup |last=Jervelund|publisher=Dansk Sprogn\u00e6vns svarbase|year=2008}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[German language|standard German]] and [[French language|French]] superseded Low German influence and in the 20th century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after [[World War II]]. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with ''\u00e6de'' (to eat) which became less common when the Low German ''spise'' came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard texts of contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16\u201217% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4\u20128%, French 2\u20124% and English about 1%.<ref name=Sproget />\n\nDanish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, commonly used Danish nouns and prepositions such as ''have'', ''over'', ''under'', ''for'', ''give'', ''flag,'' ''salt,'' and ''kat'' are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers.{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=6-10}} Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their [[Scots language|Scots]] equivalents, e.g., ''kirke'' (Scots ''kirk'', i.e., 'church') or ''barn'' (Scots ''bairn'', i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word ''by'', meaning \"village\" or \"town\", occurs in many English place-names, such as ''Whitby'' and ''Selby'', as remnants of the [[Danelaw|Viking occupation]]. During the latter period, English adopted \"are\", the third person plural form of the verb \"to be\", as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form \"they\" from contemporary Old Norse.\n\n=== Numerals{{anchor|Numerals}} ===\nIn the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered ''enogtyve'', literally \"one and twenty\".\n\nThe numeral ''halvanden'' means 1\u00bd (literally \"half second\", implying \"one plus half of the second one\"). The numerals ''halvtredje'' (2\u00bd), ''halvfjerde'' (3\u00bd) and ''halvfemte'' (4\u00bd) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the [[vigesimal]] system described below. Similarly, the [[time|temporal designation]] (''klokken'')'' halv tre'', literally \"half three (o'clock)\", is half past two.\n\nOne peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (as are the [[French language|French]] numerals from 80 through 99) based on a [[vigesimal]] system, meaning that the [[20 (number)|score]] (20) is used as a base unit in counting. ''Tres'' (short for ''tre-sinds-tyve'', \"three times twenty\") means 60, while 50 is ''halvtreds'' (short for ''halvtredje-sinds-tyve'', \"half third times twenty\", implying two score plus half of the third score). The [[suffix|ending]] ''sindstyve'' meaning \"times twenty\" is no longer included in [[cardinal number]]s, but may still be used in [[ordinal number]]s. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as ''tooghalvtreds'' from the now obsolete ''tooghalvtredsindstyve'', whereas 52nd is either ''tooghalvtredsende'' or ''tooghalvtredsindstyvende''.

The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a gap between the spoken and written languages.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=820}}\n\nThe modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: ''[[\u00e6]]'', ''[[\u00f8]]'', and ''[[\u00e5]]'', which come at the end of the [[Danish alphabet|alphabet]], in that order. The letters c, q, w, x and z are only used in loan words. A [[spelling reform]] in 1948 introduced the letter ''\u00e5'', already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''aa''.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=815}} The old usage continues to occur in some personal and [[geographical name]]s; for example, the name of the city of ''[[Aalborg]]'' is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and ''[[Aarhus]]'' decided to go back to Aa in 2011. When representing the ''\u00e5'' sound, ''aa'' is treated like ''\u00e5'' in [[collating|alphabetical sorting]], though it appears to be two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations, they are often replaced by ''ae'' (\u00c6, \u00e6), ''oe'' or ''o'' (\u00d8, \u00f8), and ''aa'' (\u00c5, \u00e5), respectively.\n\nThe same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense ''vilde'' (would), ''kunde'' (could) and ''skulde'' (should), to their current forms of ''ville'', ''kunne'' and ''skulle'' (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech).

Due to immigration and [[language shift]] in urban areas, around 15\u201320% of [[Demographics of Greenland#Ethnic groups|the population]] of [[Greenland]] speak Danish as their [[first language]].\n\nAlong with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] who lived in [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]]. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the [[Middle Norwegian]] language before the influence of Danish and [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]] are classified as West Norse along with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. A more recent classification based on [[mutual intelligibility]] separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as \"mainland Scandinavian\", while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as \"insular Scandinavian\".\n\nUntil the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to [[Scania]] with no [[standard language|standard variety]] or spelling conventions. With the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[History of printing|introduction of printing]], a standard language was developed which was based on the educated [[Copenhagen]] dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration, though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity, with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional [[Danish dialects]] have all but disappeared, though regional variants of the standard language exist. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.\n\nDanish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 [[phonemes|phonemically distinctive]] [[vowel]]s,{{sfn|Haberland|1994|page=318}} and its [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', a kind of [[glottal consonant|laryngeal phonation type]]. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and \"weakly\" pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a \"difficult language to learn, acquire and understand\",{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|2008a}} and some evidence shows that children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish compared to other languages.{{sfn|Trecca|2015}} The grammar is moderately [[Fusional language|inflective]] with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. Like English, Danish only has remnants of a former [[grammatical case|case system]], particularly in the pronouns. Unlike English, it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is [[V2 word order]], with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:North Germanic languages.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Danish and its historical relationships to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European. [[North_Germanic_languages#Classification|Another classification]] can be drawn based on mutual intellegibility.]]\nDanish is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] of the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic branch]]. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the [[Old Norse language]]; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|pp=809-10}}\n\nScandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where no sharp dividing lines are seen between the different vernacular languages.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nLike Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\nDanish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), [[Insular Danish]] (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including [[Bornholmsk dialect|Bornholmian]] and [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]]). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.{{sfn|Torp|2006}}\n\n=== Mutual intelligibility ===\nDanish is largely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}} The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=70-72}} Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general, younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.{{sfn|\u00c5kesson|2005}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Danish}}\nThe Danish philologist [[Johannes Br\u00f8ndum-Nielsen]] divided the history of Danish into a period from 800 AD to 1525 to be \"Old Danish\", which he subdivided into \"Runic Danish\" (800-1100), Early Middle Danish (1100\u20131350) and Late Middle Danish (1350\u20131525).{{sfn|Howe|1996}}\n\n{{Anchor|Runic Danish: D\u01ebnsk tunga}}\n\n=== Runic Danish===\n{{Main|Old Norse}}{{Old Norse language map}}\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''M\u00f3\u00f0ir Dyggva var Dr\u00f3tt, d\u00f3ttir Danps konungs, sonar R\u00edgs er fyrstr var konungr kalla\u00f0r \u00e1 danska tungu''.<br /> \"[[Dyggvi]]'s mother was Drott, the daughter of king Danp, [[R\u00edgs\u00feula|R\u00edg]]'s son, who was the first to be called king in the Danish tongue.\"\n|source= ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Ynglinga_saga|title=Ynglinga saga \u2013 heimskringla.no|website=www.heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n}}\nBy the eighth century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into [[Old Norse]].\nThis language was generally called the \"Danish tongue\" (''D\u01ebnsk tunga''), or \"Norse language\" (''Norr\u0153nt m\u00e1l''). Norse was written in the [[runic alphabet]], first with the [[elder futhark]] and from the 9th century with the [[younger futhark]].{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=38-41}}\n\nFrom the seventh century, the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and Old East Norse ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=39}} A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''\u00e6i'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''st\u00e6in'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. Also, a change of ''au'' as in ''dau\u00f0r'' into ''\u00f8'' as in ''d\u00f8\u00f0r'' occurred. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tau\u00fer'' into ''tu\u00fer''. Moreover, the ''\u00f8y'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''\u00f8'', as well, as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.{{sfn|Faarlund|1994|p=41}}\n\nThrough Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the [[Danelaw|northeast counties of England]]. Many words derived from Norse, such as \"gate\" ({{wiktda|gade}}) for street, still survive in [[Yorkshire]], the East Midlands and East Anglia, and [[Danelaw|parts of eastern England]] colonized by Danish [[Vikings]]. The city of [[York]] was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example \"knife\" ({{wiktda|kniv}}), \"husband\" ({{wiktda|husbond}}), and \"egg\" ({{wiktda|\u00e6g}}). The suffix \"-by\" for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby, and Grimsby.

The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish-language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The [[Codex Holmiensis|Jutlandic Law]] and [[Scanian Law]] were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration, and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=219\u201321}}\n\nThroughout this period, Danish was in contact with [[Low German language|Low German]], and many Low German loan words were introduced in this period.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996|pages=221\u2013224}} With the [[Protestant Reformation in Denmark|Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. Also in this period, Danish began to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the ''[[st\u00f8d]]'', the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.{{sfn|Torp|2006|pp=57-58}}\n\nThe first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the ''Rimkr\u00f8niken'' (''Rhyming Chronicle''), a history book told in rhymed verses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|publisher=Royal Danish Library|title=Bog Museum (Book Museum)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221182726/http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/ha/virtuelt_bogmuseum/bogmuseum_danmark.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by [[Christiern Pedersen]], was published in 1550.

In the second half of the 17th century, grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them [[Rasmus Bartholin]]'s 1657 Latin grammar ''De studio lingv\u00e6 danic\u00e6''; then [[Laurids Olufsen Kock]]'s 1660 grammar of the [[Zealand]] dialect ''Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam''; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, ''Den Danske Sprog-Kunst'' (\"The Art of the Danish Language\") by [[Peder Syv]]. Major authors from this period are [[Thomas Kingo]], poet and psalmist, and [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], whose novel ''Jammersminde'' (''Remembered Woes'') is considered a literary masterpiece by scholars. [[Orthography]] was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of [[Jens Pedersen H\u00f8ysgaard]] was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the ''st\u00f8d''. In this period, scholars were also discussing whether it was best to \"write as one speaks\" or to \"speak as one writes\", including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. ''han er'' \"he is\" vs. ''de ere'' \"they are\").{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\nThe East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)]] after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, beginning also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the [[History of Denmark#Absolutism|introduction of absolutism]] in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the Danish chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the ''de facto'' [[Lingua franca|official standard language]], especially in writing \u2014 this was the original so-called ''rigsdansk'' (\"Danish of the Realm\"). Also beginning in the mid-18th century, the ''skarre-R'', the [[Guttural R|uvular R]] sound ({{IPA|[\u0281]}}), began spreading through Denmark, likely through influence from [[Parisian French]] and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden, and coastal southern Norway.{{sfn|Torp|2006|p=52}}\n\nIn the 18th century, Danish philology was advanced by [[Rasmus Rask]], who pioneered the disciplines of [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] and [[Historical linguistics|historical]] linguistics, and wrote the first English-language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish continued to develop with the works of [[Ludvig Holberg]], whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by [[Hans Egede]], Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language until the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Pedersen|1996}}\n\n=== Standardized national language ===\n{{Quote box |width=250px |align=left|quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote=''Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,<br /> kun l\u00f8s er al fremmed Tale.<br /> Det alene i mund og bog,<br /> kan v\u00e6kke et folk af dvale.''<br /> \"Mother's name is our hearts' tongue,<br /> only idle is all foreign speech<br /> It alone, in mouth or in book,<br /> can rouse a people from sleep.\"\n|source= [[N.F.S.

The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called \"[[Danish Golden Age|Golden Age]]\" of Danish culture. Authors such as [[N.F.S. Grundtvig]] emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish-language authors of this period are [[existentialism|existential]] [[philosopher]] [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and prolific [[fairy tale]] author [[Hans Christian Andersen]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=828}} The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|Schleswig referendum in 1920]], a number of Danes remained as a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|minority within German territories]].{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=831}} Throughout the 19th century, Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina, where memory and some use of Danish remains today.\n\n[[File:LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png|thumb|right|[[Language shift]] in the 19th century in southern [[Schleswig]]]]\nAfter the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German-influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter \u00c5/\u00e5. Three 20th-century Danish authors have become [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]: [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup|Karl Gjellerup]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (joint recipients in 1917) and [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V.

Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as ''lingua franca'', and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speaks Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English, Iceland was a ruled territory of [[Denmark-Norway]], where Danish was one of the official languages.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2003}}\n\n[[File:Learn Danish in Germany, 2012, ubt.JPG|thumb|''Learn Danish'' banner in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]], where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]]]]\nIn addition, a noticeable community of Danish speakers is in [[Southern Schleswig]], the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized [[regional language]], just as [[German language|German]] is north of the border.

Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of [[suffix]]es, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as [[West Germanic languages]]. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three [[grammatical gender]]s.{{sfn|Prince|1924}} Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900, Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.{{sfn|Arboe|2008}} Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: \"Katti, han f\u00e5r unger\", literally ''The cat, he is having kittens'', because cat is a masculine noun, thus is referred to as ''han'' (he), even if it is female cat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/navneordenes_koen/|publisher=Copenhagen University, Center for Dialect Research|title=Navneordenes k\u00f8n|date=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n[[File:Michael Noer - voice - da.flac|thumb|Spoken Danish]]\n{{Main|Danish phonology}}\n\nThe sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody.

Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. {{harvcoltxt|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|page=50}} gives 25 \"full vowels\", not counting the two unstressed ''schwa'' vowels.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n!

Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}} {{IPA|/p t k/}} are aspirated in onset realized as {{IPA|[b\u0325\u02b0, d\u0325\u02e2, \u0261\u030a\u02b0]}}, but not in coda. The pronunciation of ''t'', {{IPA|[d\u0325\u02e2]}}, is in between a simple aspirated {{IPA|[d\u0325\u02b0]}} and a fully affricated {{IPA|[d\u0325s]}} as has happened in German with many words that now contain ''z''. The stops /b d g/ are realized as {{IPA|[b\u0325, d\u0325, \u0261\u030a]}} in onset and as [b\u0325 \u00f0\u031e\u02e0\u0320, j/\u028a\u032f] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes {{IPA|/b d \u0261 v j r/}} are [[contoid]] (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become [[vocoid]]s, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, l\u00f8b/ (\"grave, ran\") are pronounced {{IPA|[grau\u032f, l\u00f8u\u032f]}}.\n\n{{IPA|[\u028b, \u00f0]}} often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as [[approximant]]s. Danish {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar [[approximant]] which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] by second language learners.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=320}}\n\nThe sound {{IPA|[\u0255]}} is found for example in the word /sjov\u02c0/ \"fun\" pronounced {{IPA|[\u0255\u0252u\u032f\u02c0]}} and /tjal\u02c0/ \"marijuana\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0255al\u02c0]}}. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|[j]}} doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/j/}}, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a {{IPA|/\u0255/}}-phoneme in Danish.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gr\u00f8nnum|2005|pp=305\u2013306}}</ref>\n\nIn onset {{IPA|/r/}} is realized as a [[voiced uvular fricative|uvu-pharyngeal approximant]], {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic [[near-open central vowel|low central vowel]], {{IPA|[\u0250\u032f]}} or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the ''r'' in German or in [[non-rhotic]] pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\n=== Prosody ===\nDanish is characterized by a [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature called ''[[st\u00f8d]]'' (lit. \"thrust\"). This is a form of laryngealization or [[creaky voice]]. Some sources have described it as a [[glottal stop]], but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989}} It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in [[minimal pair]]s such as ''b\u00f8nder'' (\"peasants\") with st\u00f8d, versus ''b\u00f8nner'' (\"beans\") without st\u00f8d. The distribution of st\u00f8d in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian [[pitch accent]]s found in most dialects of [[Norwegian phonology#Accent|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish phonology#Stress and pitch|Swedish]].{{sfn| Basb\u00f8ll|2005|pp=83-86}}\n\n[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is phonemic and distinguishes words such as ''billigst'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bilist]}} \"cheapest\" and ''bilist'' {{IPA|[bi\u02c8list]}} \"car driver\".{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=811}}\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Danish grammar}}\n\nSimilarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] pattern with a rich [[inflection]]al morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly [[Analytic language|analytic]] pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed [[SVO word order]] and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''tager/tog'' (\"takes/took\") and ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' (\"foot/feet\")) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''elsker/elskede'' \"love/loved\", ''bil/biler'' \"car/cars\"). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=17}}\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an [[enclitic]]. A distinctive feature of the Nordic languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or \"[[strong inflection|strong]]\" stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. ''fod/f\u00f8dder'' \"foot/feet\", ''mand/m\u00e6nd'' \"man/men\") or \"weak\" stems inflected through affixation (e.g. ''skib/skibe'' \"ship/ships\", ''kvinde/kvinder'' \"woman/women\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=323-331}}\n\n==== Gender ====\n{{Main|Gender in Danish and Swedish}}\nStandard Danish has two [[Grammatical gender|nominal genders]]: ''common'' and ''neuter''; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the ''common'' gender, and ''neuter'' is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}}\n\n==== Definiteness ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish regular plural patterns\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 1\n! colspan=\"3\"|Class 2\n! colspan=\"3\" | Class 3\n|-\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Sg.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl.\n! style=\"font-size: smaller\" | Pl. definite.\n|-\n|''m\u00e5ned''<br />month||''m\u00e5neder''<br />months||''m\u00e5nederne''<br />the months||''dag''<br />day||''dage''<br /> days||''dagene''<br />\"the days\"||''\u00e5r'' <br />year||''\u00e5r''<br />years ||''\u00e5rene'' <br /> the years\n|-\n|''bil''<br />car||''biler''<br />cars||''bilerne''<br />the cars||''hund''<br />dog||''hunde''<br />dogs||''hundene''<br />the dogs||''fisk''<br />fish||''fisk''<br />fish (pl.)||''fiskene''<br />the fishes\n|-\n|}\nDefiniteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} Neuter nouns take the clitic ''-et'', and common gender nouns take ''-en''. Indefinite nouns take the articles ''en'' (common gender) or ''et'' (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun ''en mand'' \"a man\" (indefinite) has the definite form ''manden'' \"the man\", whereas the neuter noun ''et hus'' \"a house\" (indefinite) has the definite form, \"the house\" (definite) ''huset''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=323-324}} {{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\nIndefinite:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''et''' hus''\n:\"I saw a house\"\n\nDefinite with enclitic article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 hus'''et'''''\n:\"I saw the house\"\n\nDefinite with preposed demonstrative article:\n:''Jeg s\u00e5 '''det''' store hus''<ref group='nb'>Note here that in Swedish and Norwegian the preposed and the enclitic article occur together (e.g. ''det store huset''), whereas in Danish the enclitic article is replaced by the preposed demonstrative.</ref>\n:\"I saw the big house\"\n\nThe plural definite ending is ''-(e)ne'' (e.g. ''drenge'' \"boys > ''drengene'' \"the boys\" and ''piger'' \"girls\" > ''pigerne'' \"the girls\"), and nouns ending in -''ere'' lose the last ''-e'' before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. ''danskere'' \"Danes\" > ''danskerne'' \"the Danes\"). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article ''den'' (common) or ''det'' (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: ''den store mand'' \"the big man\", ''det store hus'' \"the big house\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=330}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=61-68}}\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==== Number ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish irregular plurals\n|-\n!

Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of ''\u00f8je'' \"eye\", which is the old dual form ''\u00f8jne''), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word ''konto'' \"account\" which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form ''konti'' \"accounts\").{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=35-40}}\n\n==== Possession ====\nPossessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -''s'', for example ''min fars hus'' \"my father's house\" where the noun ''far'' carries the possessive enclitic.{{sfn|Herslund|2001}} This is however not an example of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases ''kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik'' \"the king of Denmark's candy factory\", or ''det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter'' \"that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with\", where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=325}}{{sfn|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2015|p=53-60}}\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Person\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Objective case\n! scope=\"col\" | Dependent<br /> possessive\n! scope=\"col\" | Independent <br />possessive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. sg.\n| ''jeg'' <br /> I || ''mig''<br /> me || ''min/mit''<br /> my || ''mine''<br /> mine\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd o. sg.\n| ''du'' <br /> You || ''dig''<br /> you|| ''din/dit''<br /> your || ''dine''<br /> yours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. sg.\n| ''han/hun<br />/den/det'' <br /> he/she/it|| ''ham/hende<br />/den/det''<br /> him/her/it|| ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/her/its||  ''hans/hendes<br />/dens/dets''<br /> his/hers/its\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st p. pl.\n| ''vi''<br />we || ''os''<br /> us || ''vores''<br />our || ''vores''<br />ours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2nd p. pl.\n| ''I''<br /> you (pl.) || ''jer'' <br /> you (pl.) || ''jeres''<br /> your (pl.)|| ''jeres''<br /> yours (pl.)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3rd p. pl\n| ''de'' <br /> they|| ''dem''<br /> them || ''deres''<br /> their || ''deres''<br /> theirs\n|}\nAs does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (''han'' \"he\"), animate feminine (''hun'' \"she\") forms, as well as inanimate neuter (''det'' \"it\") and inanimate common gender (''den'' \"it\") {{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=326-328}}\n\n:''Jeg sover''\n:\"I sleep\"\n\n:''Du sover''\n:\"you sleep\"\n\n:''Jeg kysser dig''\n:\"I kiss you\"\n\n:''Du kysser mig''\n:\"you kiss me\"\n\nPossessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (''det er min hest'' \"it is my horse\"), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (''den er min'' \"it is mine\"). In the third person singular ''sin'' is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas ''hans'' (\"his\"), ''hendes'' (her) and ''dens/dets'' \"its\" is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.{{sfn|Allan|Lundskaer-Nielsen|Holmes|2005|p=63}}{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=83-85}}\n\n:''Han tog '''sin''' hat''\n:He took his (own) hat\n\n:''Han tog '''hans''' hat''\n:He took his hat (someone else's hat)\n\n==== Nominal compounds ====\nLike all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in ''kvindeh\u00e5ndboldlandsholdet'', \"the female national handball team\". In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra ''s'', originally possessive in function, like ''landsmand'' (from ''land'', \"country\", and ''mand'', \"man\", meaning \"compatriot\"), but ''landmand'' (from same roots, meaning \"farmer\"). Some words are joined with an extra ''e'', like ''g\u00e6stebog'' (from ''g\u00e6st'' and ''bog'', meaning \"guest book\").\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+ Danish verbal forms|-\n! infinitive\n!

They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=331}}\n\n{{Anchor|Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice}}\n\n==== Tense, aspect, mood, and voice ====\nVerbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=813}} The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -''te'' and those that take the suffix -''ede''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}}\n\nThe infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), infinitive forms are preceded by the article ''at'' (pronounced {{IPA|[\u0252]}}).{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=332}} The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -''r'', except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}\n\nThe present participle ends in -''ende'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bende'' \"running\"), and the past participle ends in -''et'' (e.g. ''l\u00f8bet'' \"run\"), ''-t'' (e.g. k\u00f8bt \"bought\"). [[Perfect_(grammar)|Perfect tense]] is constructed with ''at have'' (\"to have\") and participial forms, like in English. But some transitive verbs can also form an [[Imperfective|imperfective]] perfect using ''at v\u00e6re'' (\"to be\") instead.\n\n: ''Hun har g\u00e5et''. ''Flyet har fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She has walked''. ''The plane has flown''\n\n: ''Hun er g\u00e5et''. ''Flyet er fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She has left''.

''Flyet var fl\u00f8jet''\n: ''She had left''. ''The plane had taken off''\n\nThe passive form takes the suffix -s: ''avisen l\u00e6ses hver dag'' (\"the newspaper is read every day\"). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb ''at blive'' \"to become\": ''avisen bliver l\u00e6st hver dag''.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=333}}{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=814}}\n\nThe imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:\n:''l\u00f8b!''\n:\"run!\"\n\n=== Syntax ===\nDanish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|Subject\u2013Verb\u2013Object]].{{sfn|Becker-Christensen|2010|p=24}} However, Danish is also a [[V2 word order|V2 language]], which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian [[Paul Diderichsen]]{{sfn|Diderichsen|1974}} Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or \"grounding\") field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or [[Topic and comment|topics]]. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\n:''Peter (S) s\u00e5 (V) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nbut\n\n:''I g\u00e5r s\u00e5 (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)''\n:\"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte\"\n\nWhen there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a [[Dummy pronoun|dummy subject]] \"der\".{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=344}}\n\n:''der kom en pige ind ad d\u00f8ren''\n:there came a girl in through the door\n:\"A girl came in the door\"\n\n==== Main clauses ====\n{{Harvtxt|Haberland|1994|p=336}} describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:\n\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|''Og''||''ham''||''havde''||''Per''||''ikke''||''sk\u00e6nket''||''en tanke''||''i \u00e5revis''\n|-\n|And||him||had||Per||not||given||a thought||for years\n|-\n|0||1||2||3||4||5||6||7\n|-\n|colspan=\"8\" | \"And him Per hadn't given a thought in years\"\n\n|}\n\nPosition 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=336}}\n\nQuestions with [[Interrogative word|wh-words]] are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.\n\nWh-question:\n:''hvem s\u00e5 hun?'''\n: whom saw she\n:\"whom did she see?\"\n\n:''s\u00e5 hun ham?''\n:saw she him?\n:\"did she see him?\"\n\n==== Subordinate clauses ====\nIn subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).{{sfn|Jensen|2011}} [[Complement clause]]s begin with the particle ''at'' in the \"connector field\".\n\n:''Han sagde '''at han ikke ville g\u00e5'''''\n:he said that he not would go\n:\"He said that he did not want to go\"\n\n[[Relative clause]]s are marked by the relative articles ''som'' or ''der'' which occupy the preverbal slot:\n\n:''Jeg kender en mand '''som''' bor i Helsing\u00f8r{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=345}}\n:\"I know a man who lives in Elsinore\"\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Danish military police Mercedes.JPG|thumb|Danish label reading ''milit\u00e6rpoliti,'' \"military police\", on police vehicle]]\nAbout 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the [[Old Norse language]], and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]]. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.{{sfn|Haberland|1994|pp=346-347}} Danish has also absorbed a large number of [[loan words]], most of which were borrowed from [[Middle Low German]] in the [[late medieval]] period. Out of the 500 most frequently used words in Danish, 100 are medieval loans from Middle Low German, as Low German is the other official language of Denmark-Norway.<ref name=Sproget>{{cite web|url=http://sproget.dk/raad-og-regler/artikler-mv/svarbase/SV00001479|title=Antal arveord og l\u00e5neord|first=Anita \u00c5gerup |last=Jervelund|publisher=Dansk Sprogn\u00e6vns svarbase|year=2008}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[German language|standard German]] and [[French language|French]] superseded Low German influence and in the 20th century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after [[World War II]]. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with ''\u00e6de'' (to eat) which became less common when the Low German ''spise'' came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard texts of contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16\u201217% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4\u20128%, French 2\u20124% and English about 1%.<ref name=Sproget />\n\nDanish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, commonly used Danish nouns and prepositions such as ''have'', ''over'', ''under'', ''for'', ''give'', ''flag,'' ''salt,'' and ''kat'' are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers.{{sfn|Bredsdorff|1958|pp=6-10}} Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their [[Scots language|Scots]] equivalents, e.g., ''kirke'' (Scots ''kirk'', i.e., 'church') or ''barn'' (Scots ''bairn'', i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word ''by'', meaning \"village\" or \"town\", occurs in many English place-names, such as ''Whitby'' and ''Selby'', as remnants of the [[Danelaw|Viking occupation]]. During the latter period, English adopted \"are\", the third person plural form of the verb \"to be\", as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form \"they\" from contemporary Old Norse.\n\n=== Numerals{{anchor|Numerals}} ===\nIn the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered ''enogtyve'', literally \"one and twenty\".\n\nThe numeral ''halvanden'' means 1\u00bd (literally \"half second\", implying \"one plus half of the second one\"). The numerals ''halvtredje'' (2\u00bd), ''halvfjerde'' (3\u00bd) and ''halvfemte'' (4\u00bd) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the [[vigesimal]] system described below. Similarly, the [[time|temporal designation]] (''klokken'')'' halv tre'', literally \"half three (o'clock)\", is half past two.\n\nOne peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (as are the [[French language|French]] numerals from 80 through 99) based on a [[vigesimal]] system, meaning that the [[20 (number)|score]] (20) is used as a base unit in counting. ''Tres'' (short for ''tre-sinds-tyve'', \"three times twenty\") means 60, while 50 is ''halvtreds'' (short for ''halvtredje-sinds-tyve'', \"half third times twenty\", implying two score plus half of the third score). The [[suffix|ending]] ''sindstyve'' meaning \"times twenty\" is no longer included in [[cardinal number]]s, but may still be used in [[ordinal number]]s. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as ''tooghalvtreds'' from the now obsolete ''tooghalvtredsindstyve'', whereas 52nd is either ''tooghalvtredsende'' or ''tooghalvtredsindstyvende''. Twenty is ''tyve'' (derived from old Danish ''tiughu'', a [[haplology]] of ''tuttiughu'', meaning 'two tens'<ref name=\"ODS\">{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?select=tyve,4&query=tyve|title=tyve,4 \u2014 ODS|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref>), while thirty is ''tredive'' (Old Danish ''\u00ferjatiughu'', \"three tens\"), and forty is ''fyrre'' (Old Danish ''fyritiughu'', \"four tens\",<ref name=\"dsnfaq\">[http://dsn.dk/sproghjaelp/ofte-stillede-spoergsmaal/de-danske-tal-halvtreds-tres-halvfjerds-firs-og-halvfems {{in lang|da}} Dansk sprogn\u00e6vn \u2013 De danske tal halvtreds, tres, halvfjerds, firs og halvfems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825105818/http://dsn.dk/sproghjaelp/ofte-stillede-spoergsmaal/de-danske-tal-halvtreds-tres-halvfjerds-firs-og-halvfems |date=25 August 2011 }}{{Subscription required}}</ref> still used today as the [[archaism]] ''fyrretyve'').{{sfn|Haberland|1994|p=348}} Thus, the suffix ''-tyve'' should be understood as a plural of ''ti'' (10), though to modern Danes ''tyve'' means 20, making it hard to explain why ''fyrretyve'' is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a gap between the spoken and written languages.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=820}}\n\nThe modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: ''[[\u00e6]]'', ''[[\u00f8]]'', and ''[[\u00e5]]'', which come at the end of the [[Danish alphabet|alphabet]], in that order. The letters c, q, w, x and z are only used in loan words. A [[spelling reform]] in 1948 introduced the letter ''\u00e5'', already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''aa''.{{sfn|Rischel|2012|p=815}} The old usage continues to occur in some personal and [[geographical name]]s; for example, the name of the city of ''[[Aalborg]]'' is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and ''[[Aarhus]]'' decided to go back to Aa in 2011. When representing the ''\u00e5'' sound, ''aa'' is treated like ''\u00e5'' in [[collating|alphabetical sorting]], though it appears to be two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations, they are often replaced by ''ae'' (\u00c6, \u00e6), ''oe'' or ''o'' (\u00d8, \u00f8), and ''aa'' (\u00c5, \u00e5), respectively.\n\nThe same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense ''vilde'' (would), ''kunde'' (could) and ''skulde'' (should), to their current forms of ''ville'', ''kunne'' and ''skulle'' (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech).
