It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others), Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself) and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] (Hakaj). To the east in [[Ro\u017eaje]] and the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau, many families trace their origin to Kelmendi. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]]. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Vojvodina]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918). Kelmendi bajraks are numbered 1\u20134.]]\nThe Kelmendi region is located in the [[District of Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]] in northern Albania, situated in the northernmost and most isolated part of the country. It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others) and Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself). To the east in [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], [[Ro\u017eaje]] and the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau, many families trace their origin to Kelmendi. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]]. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Vojvodina]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918).

It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850.

One story has it that the founder settled from Lajqit e Hotit, in Hoti, and to Hoti from Fundane, the village of Lopare in Ku\u010di; he was upset with the Hoti and Ku\u010di, and therefore left those tribes. When he lived in Lopare, he married a girl from Triepshi, who followed him. His name was Amati, and his wife's name was Bum\u00e7e.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

The 7th V\u00e2n\u0103tori division advanced in the direction of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]]. The 1st division advanced in the direction of [[Alba-Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Kolozsv\u00e1r. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]] and the 6th Division to Brass\u00f3 ([[Bra\u015fov]]). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\"). The K\u00e1rolyi government would not accept the terms and this was a trigger for the coup d'\u00e9tat by [[B\u00e9la Kun]], who formed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary.\n\nOn 4 April, South African General [[Jan Smuts]] was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note.

Smuts' negotiations ceased.\n\nKun stalled for time{{how|date=July 2017}} in order to build a force capable of fighting Romania and Czechoslovakia. Hungary had 20,000 troops facing the Romanian army and mobilized a further 60,000. There were recruitment centers in towns such as [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Szolnok]]. There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General [[Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu]] commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Mo\u015foiu. Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]]. This would separate the elite Hungarian [[Sz\u00e9kely]] division from the rest of the Hungarian army. The north battalion would then outflank the Hungarian Army.

The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld, it ousted Czech troops from the north, and planned to march against the Romanian army in the east.\n\nKun ordered the preparation of an [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|offensive against Czechoslovakia]], which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Army recruited men between 19\u201325 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions\u201440 battalions\u2014to [[Upper Hungary]].\n\nOn 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel [[Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld]] attacked and routed Czech troops from [[Miskolc]]. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czech army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian army retreated to its bridgehead at [[Tokaj]]. There, between 25\u201330 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks.\n\nOn 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from [[Bukovina]] since 22 May.

The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}. The front extended from beyond [[Szeged]] in the south\u2014adjacent to French and Serb troops\u2014to [[Tokaj]] in the north\u2014adjacent to Czechoslovak troops. On 17 July, Hungary attacked.\n\n=== Hungarian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nKun's [[political commissar]]s directed the Hungarian Army, supported by experienced professional military officers. Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Soviet Russia]] to attack Bessarabia.\n\n=== Romanian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155&nbsp;mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Budapest ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianArmyInFrontOfBudapestParliament.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian army in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], Budapest, 1919.]]\n[[File:Romanian troops in Budapest 1919.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919.]]\nRomanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns\u2014including two with a caliber of 305&nbsp;mm\u2014332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianSoldiersFeedingCiviliansInBudapest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary.]]\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 36.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest.]]\nOn 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]] was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] as Hungary's head of state and [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Hungary ===\nRomania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around [[Lake Balaton]].

The 1st, 7th and 8th [[Huntsmen (military)|V\u00e2n\u0103tori]] divisions, stationed in [[Moldavia]], were the first units to be mobilized. The 8th was sent to [[Bukovina]] and the other two were sent to Transylvania. On 13 November, the 7th entered Transylvania at the [[Pris\u0103cani River]] in the eastern Carpathians. The 1st then entered Transylvania at [[Palanca, Bac\u0103u]].<ref>Mardarescu G.D.

This was a demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Allied powers and Hungary at the Armistice of Belgrade. At the same time units of the German army, under the command of Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], retreated to the west.\n\nFollowing a request from Romania, the Allied Command in the east under the leadership of French Genenral [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] allowed the Romanian army to advance to the line of the western Carpathians. The 7th V\u00e2n\u0103tori division advanced in the direction of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]]. The 1st division advanced in the direction of [[Alba-Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Kolozsv\u00e1r. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]] and the 6th Division to Brass\u00f3 ([[Bra\u015fov]]). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\"). The K\u00e1rolyi government would not accept the terms and this was a trigger for the coup d'\u00e9tat by [[B\u00e9la Kun]], who formed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Around this time limited skirmishes took place between Romanian and Hungarian troops. Some Hungarian elements engaged in the harassment of the Romanian population outside the area controlled by the Romanian Army.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\">Kiritescu C.

The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary.\n\nOn 4 April, South African General [[Jan Smuts]] was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note. Smuts' mission also represented official recognition of the Kun communist government by the Allied council. He may have asked if Kun would act as a conduit for communication between the Allied council and the Bolshevik Soviet Russians.<ref>Read A.

Kun refused the terms, demanding that  Romanian forces return to the line of the Maros River. Smuts' negotiations ceased.\n\nKun stalled for time{{how|date=July 2017}} in order to build a force capable of fighting Romania and Czechoslovakia. Hungary had 20,000 troops facing the Romanian army and mobilized a further 60,000. There were recruitment centers in towns such as [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Szolnok]]. There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General [[Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu]] commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Mo\u015foiu. Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]]. This would separate the elite Hungarian [[Sz\u00e9kely]] division from the rest of the Hungarian army. The north battalion would then outflank the Hungarian Army. Simultaneously, the south battalion would advance to [[Lipova, Arad|M\u00e1riaradna]] and [[Beiu\u015f|Bel\u00e9nyes]].\n\n== Hostilities begin ==\n\n=== Foreign policy scandal: the establishment of Slovak Soviet Republic ===\n\nIn late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to \"fulfill\" his promise to adhere to Hungary's historical borders.

The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld, it ousted Czech troops from the north, and planned to march against the Romanian army in the east.\n\nKun ordered the preparation of an [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|offensive against Czechoslovakia]], which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Army recruited men between 19\u201325 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions\u201440 battalions\u2014to [[Upper Hungary]].\n\nOn 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel [[Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld]] attacked and routed Czech troops from [[Miskolc]]. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czech army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian army retreated to its bridgehead at [[Tokaj]]. There, between 25\u201330 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks.\n\nOn 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from [[Bukovina]] since 22 May. Hungary then controlled the territory to its [[Kingdom of Hungary|old borders]]; regained control of industrial areas around [[Miskolc]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica|Selmecb\u00e1nya]], [[Ko\u0161ice|Kassa]].\n\n===Demoralization of the Red Army===\nDespite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Eperjes) on 16 June 1919.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jack A.

They established two concentric defense lines extending from the Tisza River around Szolnok. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines. On the evening of 1 May the entire east bank of the Tisza River was under the control of the Romanian army.\n\nOn 30 April, French Foreign Minister [[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] summoned [[Ion I.C.

The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}.

Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Soviet Russia]] to attack Bessarabia.\n\n=== Romanian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155&nbsp;mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Budapest ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianArmyInFrontOfBudapestParliament.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian army in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], Budapest, 1919.]]\n[[File:Romanian troops in Budapest 1919.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919.]]\nRomanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action.

A socialist government under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]] was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] as Hungary's head of state and [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Hungary ===\nRomania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around [[Lake Balaton]].
