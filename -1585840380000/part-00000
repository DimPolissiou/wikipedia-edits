At the age of 23, he was hired by Packers head coach [[Gene Ronzani]] to lead the team's player personnel department. In a time when most professional football teams relied on the media for information on college players, Vainisi enlisted college coaches to provide scouting reports on not only their own players, but also opposition players. During his time in charge of player personnel, the Packers drafted or acquired eight future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] players. Vainisi also was instrumental in attracting [[Vince Lombardi]] to the vacant head coaching job in Green Bay in 1959.

(August 27, 1927 &ndash; November 27, 1960) was an American [[Scout (sport)|scout]] and personnel director for the [[Green Bay Packers]] from 1950 to 1960. At the age of 23, he was hired by Packers head coach [[Gene Ronzani]] to lead the team's player personnel department. In a time when most professional football teams relied on the media for information on college players, Vainisi enlisted college coaches to provide scouting reports on not only their own players, but also opposition players. During his time in charge of player personnel, the Packers drafted or acquired eight future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] players. Vainisi also was instrumental in attracting [[Vince Lombardi]] to the vacant head coaching job in Green Bay in 1959. Vainisi did not live to see the success of the teams he helped assemble though, as he died from a heart attack in 1960 at the age of 33.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Early life==\nJack Vainisi was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on August 27, 1927 to Anthony and Marie Vainisi.<ref name=\"MARIE\"/><ref name=\"HOF\"/> The Vainisi family, who lived on the North Side of Chicago, were strong supporters of the [[Chicago Bears]].

Warby climbed into the cockpit and proved he had a great success - setting an Australian record of 267km/h, but a long way short of the 458.98 km/h world record.\n\nWarby continued to trial his boat, gradually increasing his Australian record.

Prior to becoming involved in the juvenile justice system, there is evidence that girls experience higher rates of trauma and sexual abuse than systems-involved boys.<ref name=\":1\" />  For example, in a study of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida, Baglivio et al. found that these offenders had experienced high numbers of \"[[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|Adverse Childhood Experiences]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baglivio|first=Michael|date=Spring 2014|title=The Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) in the Lives of Juvenile Offenders|url=http://www.journalofjuvjustice.org/JOJJ0302/article01.htm|journal=Journal of Juvenile Justice|volume=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> These experiences differed by gender. 31% of the girls in the study had experienced childhood sexual abuse, while only 7% of boys had. 45% of the girls and 24% of boys had experienced five or more Adverse Childhood experiences.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, research has indicated that girls who experience trauma are more likely than boys to develop mental health conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Research has not established a causal link between trauma exposure and delinquent behavior, but has established a correlation. For example, research by Smith et al. on adolescent girls in Oregon's juvenile justice system found that sexual abuse, but not physical abuse or lifetime trauma, were significantly associated with substance use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dana K|date=2013|title=Trauma, Delinquency, and Substance Use: Co-occurring Problems for Adolescent Girls in the Juvenile Justice System|url=|journal=Journal of Child & Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=22|issue=5|pages=450\u2013465|via=|doi=10.1080/1067828x.2013.788895|pmid=24039384|pmc=3771528}}</ref> The differential rate of and response to trauma exposure by gender has therefore been identified as an explanation for the disproportionate entry of girls into the juvenile justice system. In this theory, behaviors that are coping mechanisms for trauma experienced by girls, such as alcohol and drug use, and status offenses such as running away from home or shoplifting, are criminalized, leading to their system involvement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nGirls in the United States enter a Juvenile Justice System that was initially formed in a manner intended to cater to predominately male offenders.  Assessment tools used by most institutions were designed for this use. Additionally, research has estimated that between 67\u201390% of youth in juvenile detention facilities have at least one mental health diagnosis, and that [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] rates among youth in these facilities may be as much as 10\u201315 times higher than in the general population. However, as of 2007, less than 2% of juvenile justice residential facilities in the U.S. were accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care for facility medical and mental health care.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Julian|date=2013|title=Systemic Self-Regulation: A Framework for Trauma-Informed Services in Residential Juvenile Justice Programs|url=|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=28|issue=7|pages=665\u2013667|via=|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9538-5}}</ref> \nResearch indicates a lack of programming for girls has been an ongoing issue for several decades. A review of delinquency prevention programs across the country found 433 identified programs out of the number 2% were designed for girls.<ref>{{cite journal|date=August 2010|title=Juvenile Justice Policy Brief Series|journal=Gender Responsiveness and Equity in the California Juvenile Justice System|accessdate=}}</ref>  The mismatch between the system's design and the unique needs and experiences of girls has been identified as particularly problematic given the prevalence of sexual abuse and trauma history among systems-involved girls. National surveys conducted by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention have found insufficient health and trauma-related services for girls in residential detention centers. For example, only 18% of juvenile justice facilities provided pregnancy testing upon entry to the facility. For girls who have experienced trauma, status quo procedures within detention facilities, such as shackling, isolation, strip searches, and lack of access to comprehensive health and hygiene statuses can re-trigger trauma experiences and responses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBeyond establishing differing rates of childhood sexual abuse and trauma exposure among juvenile justice-involved youth by gender, research has indicated that the link between childhood sexual abuse and recidivism varies by gender. Research by Conrad et al. on males and females in the Northeast United States from 2006\u20132008 found that gender alone did not predict recidivism rates for juvenile-justice involved youth. However, for girls only, childhood sexual abuse exposure was the only significant predictor of recidivism, with sexually abused girls being five times as likely to re-offend when compared to girls who had not been sexually abused.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Selby M.|last2=Tolou-Shams|first2=Marina|last3=Rizzo|first3=Christie J.|last4=Placella|first4=Nicole|last5=Brown|first5=Larry K.|title=Gender differences in recidivism rates for juvenile justice youth: The impact of sexual abuse.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=38|issue=4|pages=305\u2013314|doi=10.1037/lhb0000062|pmc=4351738|pmid=24127890|year=2014}}</ref> This along with other research has led many academics, systems administrators, and policymakers to focus on the importance of childhood sexual abuse, specifically on the role this abuse plays in increasing the likelihood that girls will be involved in the juvenile justice system, will be re-traumatized by experiences within the system, and will be more likely to recidivate and continue a cycle of criminal justice involvement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nResearch has shown that juvenile-justice involved youth who have been sexually abused are at increased risk for being victims of human trafficking. In a study by Reid et al. (2017) examining the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences among boys and girls in the juvenile justice system in Florida who were reported as victims of human trafficking between 2009\u20132015, sexual abuse history was determined to be the strongest factor predicting likelihood of human trafficking victimization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Joan A.|last2=Baglivio|first2=Michael T.|last3=Piquero|first3=Alex R.|last4=Greenwald|first4=Mark A.|last5=Epps|first5=Nathan|date=2016-12-20|title=Human Trafficking of Minors and Childhood Adversity in Florida|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=2|pages=306\u2013311|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303564|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5227932|pmid=27997232}}</ref> While sex trafficking by minors under age 18 has been decriminalized in many states, with young participants being treated as victims, participation in sex trafficking increases the likelihood of an individual being involved in the juvenile or adult criminal justice system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History of gender responsiveness==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe 1992 reauthorization of the [[Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act]] included an amendment that instructed state juvenile justice systems to assess their gender responsiveness and provide gender-appropriate services in order to qualify for federal formula dollars.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was the first time that the JJDP act explicitly focused on the needs of juvenile females and ultimately led to increased attention on a state-level to gender bias assessments and gender responsive policy development and implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/gender/oview-3.html|title=National Efforts to Address the Needs of the Adolescent Female Offender|website=www.ojjdp.gov|access-date=2017-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Gender responsive treatment components ==\nGender responsive treatment approaches can be utilized across the continuum of care for juvenile-justice system involved girls. Responses designed to cater to females include collaboration by courts, lawyers, probation, human services, community programming, and federal and local governments. The goal of collaboration is to address the needs of girls and consider the big picture of what the problems are. Female staff are used in an effort to address relationships and provide positive female role models for girls.\nServices that may be provided or encouraged range from keeping the girl in her home and providing [[family support]] and [[counseling]], [[conflict resolution]], [[education]] and [[life skills]], [[pregnancy prevention]], [[parenting]], [[domestic violence]] and [[empowerment]].\n\nResearch conducted by Walker et al. on gender responsive practices in the juvenile justice system identified several core areas in which gender responsive practices are being implemented in several jurisdictions in the United States. These include screening and assessment practices, family engagement, emphasizing a relational approach, safety, skills and strengths-based approach, and reentry and community connections. Walker et al. surveyed state and county-level juvenile justice providers in 10 states and conducted in-person assessments to identify how these gender responsive approaches in these areas are implemented. Respondents indicated that in screening and assessment upon intake to the juvenile justice system, placing an emphasis on assessments that are individualized, screening for trauma, connecting assessments to treatment and aftercare planning, and utilizing validated risk assessment tools were crucial to a gender-responsive approach. After the intake and assessment process, respondents highlighted the importance of engaging families in the provision of juvenile justice services. This included efforts to remove barriers to families, such as through the placement of a girl in the facility located closest to her family, which allows for connection between child and family throughout the detention process. In treatment approaches, some respondents reported utilizing skills-based and strengths-based approaches, and treatments that were trauma-informed, including [[dialectical behavior therapy]]. Some reported developing policies that emphasized a relational approach, focusing on helping girls in the juvenile justice system build and maintain healthy, supportive relationships, and that these jurisdictions viewed this approach as being especially crucial to supporting girls. Another area highlighted by many respondents within the area of treatment was the importance of safety to a gender responsive approach. This could include crisis-intervention training, limiting physical contact between staff and girls, and utilizing female staff in female facilities. Finally, providers reported emphasizing planning for girls re-entry into the community throughout the time girls are in residential facilities. This could be through approaches in which girls work with the same social worker during and after staying in a residential facility, or working with girls to identify and access supportive resources and individuals within their communities. Staff reported the importance of considering prevalence of sexual abuse when developing policies and practices for girls, on emphasizing diversity among girls and resisting stereotyping, and on planning for successful re-entry.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Effectiveness ===\nAs some jurisdictions have begun implementing gender-responsive approaches in their juvenile justice system, it has been difficult to conduct the caliber of quantitative research necessary to establish an evidence base on the effectiveness of these approaches. This is due to the small number of girls within a given juvenile justice system who would be exposed to new programs or policies and the challenges this poses for statistically rigorous study designs.<ref name=\":2\" /> In one qualitative analysis by Hodge et al., county juvenile court staff were interviewed to determine if gender-responsive programming was meeting its intended goal. In these interviews staff reported substantial efforts to implement these approaches, as well as significant need to improve staff training and address gendered norms and stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hodge|first=Jessica P.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Kristi|last3=Maziarka|first3=Kristen|date=2015-05-27|title=Assessing the Status of Gender-Specific Programs through the Lens of Juvenile Justice Staff|journal=Women & Criminal Justice|volume=25|issue=3|pages=184\u2013200|doi=10.1080/08974454.2014.989303|issn=0897-4454}}</ref> Analysis of preliminary results of the evaluation the [http://projectkealahou.org/ Project Kealahou] program in Hawaii indicated that girls in the program demonstrated improvements across multiple outcomes.

These programs aim to address the unique needs of girls by providing a variety of services. Many have gendered risk assessments that occur immediately upon entry into the justice system.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[Girl's court]] (Growing Independence Restoring Lives) offers a variety of programs in the United States. The courts identify that girls have traumatic life events and seeks to address underlying problems that may cause crimes. Some communities chose to view the girl as a child in need of assistance. Services vary from immediate attention and clinical intervention, addressing gender specific issues, to acknowledging unique needs and differences. Many of the courts seek to have a supportive adult from the girl's life to participate.\n\nIn February, 2017, the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] started a multi-agency task force, \"Task Force on Ending Girls' Incarceration in New York City\" in partnership with New York City.

Prior to becoming involved in the juvenile justice system, there is evidence that girls experience higher rates of trauma and sexual abuse than systems-involved boys.<ref name=\":1\" />  For example, in a study of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida, Baglivio et al. found that these offenders had experienced high numbers of \"[[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|Adverse Childhood Experiences]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baglivio|first=Michael|date=Spring 2014|title=The Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) in the Lives of Juvenile Offenders|url=http://www.journalofjuvjustice.org/JOJJ0302/article01.htm|journal=Journal of Juvenile Justice|volume=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> These experiences differed by gender. 31% of the girls in the study had experienced childhood sexual abuse, while only 7% of boys had. 45% of the girls and 24% of boys had experienced five or more Adverse Childhood experiences.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, research has indicated that girls who experience trauma are more likely than boys to develop mental health conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Research has not established a causal link between trauma exposure and delinquent behavior, but has established a correlation. For example, research by Smith et al. on adolescent girls in Oregon's juvenile justice system found that sexual abuse, but not physical abuse or lifetime trauma, were significantly associated with substance use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dana K|date=2013|title=Trauma, Delinquency, and Substance Use: Co-occurring Problems for Adolescent Girls in the Juvenile Justice System|url=|journal=Journal of Child & Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=22|issue=5|pages=450\u2013465|via=|doi=10.1080/1067828x.2013.788895|pmid=24039384|pmc=3771528}}</ref> The differential rate of and response to trauma exposure by gender has therefore been identified as an explanation for the disproportionate entry of girls into the juvenile justice system. In this theory, behaviors that are coping mechanisms for trauma experienced by girls, such as alcohol and drug use, and status offenses such as running away from home or shoplifting, are criminalized, leading to their system involvement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nGirls in the United States enter a Juvenile Justice System that was initially formed in a manner intended to cater to predominately male offenders.  Assessment tools used by most institutions were designed for this use. Additionally, research has estimated that between 67\u201390% of youth in juvenile detention facilities have at least one mental health diagnosis, and that [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] rates among youth in these facilities may be as much as 10\u201315 times higher than in the general population. However, as of 2007, less than 2% of juvenile justice residential facilities in the U.S. were accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care for facility medical and mental health care.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Julian|date=2013|title=Systemic Self-Regulation: A Framework for Trauma-Informed Services in Residential Juvenile Justice Programs|url=|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=28|issue=7|pages=665\u2013667|via=|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9538-5}}</ref> \nResearch indicates a lack of programming for girls has been an ongoing issue for several decades. A review of delinquency prevention programs across the country found 433 identified programs out of the number 2% were designed for girls.<ref>{{cite journal|date=August 2010|title=Juvenile Justice Policy Brief Series|journal=Gender Responsiveness and Equity in the California Juvenile Justice System|accessdate=}}</ref>  The mismatch between the system's design and the unique needs and experiences of girls has been identified as particularly problematic given the prevalence of sexual abuse and trauma history among systems-involved girls. National surveys conducted by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention have found insufficient health and trauma-related services for girls in residential detention centers. For example, only 18% of juvenile justice facilities provided pregnancy testing upon entry to the facility. For girls who have experienced trauma, status quo procedures within detention facilities, such as shackling, isolation, strip searches, and lack of access to comprehensive health and hygiene statuses can re-trigger trauma experiences and responses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBeyond establishing differing rates of childhood sexual abuse and trauma exposure among juvenile justice-involved youth by gender, research has indicated that the link between childhood sexual abuse and recidivism varies by gender. Research by Conrad et al. on males and females in the Northeast United States from 2006\u20132008 found that gender alone did not predict recidivism rates for juvenile-justice involved youth. However, for girls only, childhood sexual abuse exposure was the only significant predictor of recidivism, with sexually abused girls being five times as likely to re-offend when compared to girls who had not been sexually abused.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Selby M.|last2=Tolou-Shams|first2=Marina|last3=Rizzo|first3=Christie J.|last4=Placella|first4=Nicole|last5=Brown|first5=Larry K.|title=Gender differences in recidivism rates for juvenile justice youth: The impact of sexual abuse.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=38|issue=4|pages=305\u2013314|doi=10.1037/lhb0000062|pmc=4351738|pmid=24127890|year=2014}}</ref> This along with other research has led many academics, systems administrators, and policymakers to focus on the importance of childhood sexual abuse, specifically on the role this abuse plays in increasing the likelihood that girls will be involved in the juvenile justice system, will be re-traumatized by experiences within the system, and will be more likely to recidivate and continue a cycle of criminal justice involvement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nResearch has shown that juvenile-justice involved youth who have been sexually abused are at increased risk for being victims of human trafficking. In a study by Reid et al. (2017) examining the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences among boys and girls in the juvenile justice system in Florida who were reported as victims of human trafficking between 2009\u20132015, sexual abuse history was determined to be the strongest factor predicting likelihood of human trafficking victimization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Joan A.|last2=Baglivio|first2=Michael T.|last3=Piquero|first3=Alex R.|last4=Greenwald|first4=Mark A.|last5=Epps|first5=Nathan|date=2016-12-20|title=Human Trafficking of Minors and Childhood Adversity in Florida|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=2|pages=306\u2013311|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303564|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5227932|pmid=27997232}}</ref> While sex trafficking by minors under age 18 has been decriminalized in many states, with young participants being treated as victims, participation in sex trafficking increases the likelihood of an individual being involved in the juvenile or adult criminal justice system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History of gender responsiveness==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe 1992 reauthorization of the [[Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act]] included an amendment that instructed state juvenile justice systems to assess their gender responsiveness and provide gender-appropriate services in order to qualify for federal formula dollars.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was the first time that the JJDP act explicitly focused on the needs of juvenile females and ultimately led to increased attention on a state-level to gender bias assessments and gender responsive policy development and implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/gender/oview-3.html|title=National Efforts to Address the Needs of the Adolescent Female Offender|website=www.ojjdp.gov|access-date=2017-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Gender responsive treatment components ==\nGender responsive treatment approaches can be utilized across the continuum of care for juvenile-justice system involved girls. Responses designed to cater to females include collaboration by courts, lawyers, probation, human services, community programming, and federal and local governments. The goal of collaboration is to address the needs of girls and consider the big picture of what the problems are. Female staff are used in an effort to address relationships and provide positive female role models for girls.\nServices that may be provided or encouraged range from keeping the girl in her home and providing [[family support]] and [[counseling]], [[conflict resolution]], [[education]] and [[life skills]], [[pregnancy prevention]], [[parenting]], [[domestic violence]] and [[empowerment]].\n\nResearch conducted by Walker et al. on gender responsive practices in the juvenile justice system identified several core areas in which gender responsive practices are being implemented in several jurisdictions in the United States. These include screening and assessment practices, family engagement, emphasizing a relational approach, safety, skills and strengths-based approach, and reentry and community connections. Walker et al. surveyed state and county-level juvenile justice providers in 10 states and conducted in-person assessments to identify how these gender responsive approaches in these areas are implemented. Respondents indicated that in screening and assessment upon intake to the juvenile justice system, placing an emphasis on assessments that are individualized, screening for trauma, connecting assessments to treatment and aftercare planning, and utilizing validated risk assessment tools were crucial to a gender-responsive approach. After the intake and assessment process, respondents highlighted the importance of engaging families in the provision of juvenile justice services. This included efforts to remove barriers to families, such as through the placement of a girl in the facility located closest to her family, which allows for connection between child and family throughout the detention process. In treatment approaches, some respondents reported utilizing skills-based and strengths-based approaches, and treatments that were trauma-informed, including [[dialectical behavior therapy]]. Some reported developing policies that emphasized a relational approach, focusing on helping girls in the juvenile justice system build and maintain healthy, supportive relationships, and that these jurisdictions viewed this approach as being especially crucial to supporting girls. Another area highlighted by many respondents within the area of treatment was the importance of safety to a gender responsive approach. This could include crisis-intervention training, limiting physical contact between staff and girls, and utilizing female staff in female facilities. Finally, providers reported emphasizing planning for girls re-entry into the community throughout the time girls are in residential facilities. This could be through approaches in which girls work with the same social worker during and after staying in a residential facility, or working with girls to identify and access supportive resources and individuals within their communities. Staff reported the importance of considering prevalence of sexual abuse when developing policies and practices for girls, on emphasizing diversity among girls and resisting stereotyping, and on planning for successful re-entry.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Effectiveness ===\nAs some jurisdictions have begun implementing gender-responsive approaches in their juvenile justice system, it has been difficult to conduct the caliber of quantitative research necessary to establish an evidence base on the effectiveness of these approaches. This is due to the small number of girls within a given juvenile justice system who would be exposed to new programs or policies and the challenges this poses for statistically rigorous study designs.<ref name=\":2\" /> In one qualitative analysis by Hodge et al., county juvenile court staff were interviewed to determine if gender-responsive programming was meeting its intended goal. In these interviews staff reported substantial efforts to implement these approaches, as well as significant need to improve staff training and address gendered norms and stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hodge|first=Jessica P.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Kristi|last3=Maziarka|first3=Kristen|date=2015-05-27|title=Assessing the Status of Gender-Specific Programs through the Lens of Juvenile Justice Staff|journal=Women & Criminal Justice|volume=25|issue=3|pages=184\u2013200|doi=10.1080/08974454.2014.989303|issn=0897-4454}}</ref> Analysis of preliminary results of the evaluation the [http://projectkealahou.org/ Project Kealahou] program in Hawaii indicated that girls in the program demonstrated improvements across multiple outcomes.

These programs aim to address the unique needs of girls by providing a variety of services. Many have gendered risk assessments that occur immediately upon entry into the justice system.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[Girl's court]] (Growing Independence Restoring Lives) offers a variety of programs in the United States. The courts identify that girls have traumatic life events and seeks to address underlying problems that may cause crimes. Some communities chose to view the girl as a child in need of assistance. Services vary from immediate attention and clinical intervention, addressing gender specific issues, to acknowledging unique needs and differences. Many of the courts seek to have a supportive adult from the girl's life to participate.\n\nIn February, 2017, the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] started a multi-agency task force, \"Task Force on Ending Girls' Incarceration in New York City\" in partnership with New York City.

This process is hastened by the action of ''[[Acidithiobacillus]]'' bacteria which oxidize the pyrite to produce ferrous iron and sulfate. These reactions occur more rapidly when the pyrite is in fine crystals and dust, which is the form it takes in most mining operations.\n\n===Acid drainage===\n[[Sulfate]] released from decomposing pyrite combines with water, producing [[sulfuric acid]], leading to [[acid rock drainage]]. An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]].\n\n===Dust explosions===\nPyrite oxidation is sufficiently [[exothermic]] that underground [[coal mine]]s in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with [[spontaneous combustion]] in the mined-out areas of the mine.

This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S\u2013S bonds. These '''[[persulfide]]''' units can be viewed as derived from [[hydrogen disulfide]], H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, [[molybdenite]], [[molybdenum|Mo]]S<sub>2</sub>, features isolated sulfide (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>) centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo<sup>4+</sup>. The mineral [[arsenopyrite]] has the formula Fe[[arsenic|As]]S. Whereas pyrite has S<sub>2</sub> subunits, arsenopyrite has [AsS] units, formally derived from [[deprotonation]] of H<sub>2</sub>AsSH. Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe<sup>3+</sup>[AsS]<sup>3\u2212</sup>.<ref name=Vaughan>{{cite book |author1=Vaughan, D.

The shift from fluorite ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.25 to pyrite ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.385 is rather large and creates an S\u2013S distance that is clearly a binding one. This is not surprising as in contrast to F<sup>\u2212</sup> an ion S<sup>\u2212</sup> is not a closed shell species. It is isoelectronic with a chlorine ''atom'', also undergoing pairing to form Cl<sub>2</sub> molecules. Both low spin Fe<sup>2+</sup> and the disulfide S<sub>2</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup> moeties are closed shell entities, explaining the diamagnetic and semiconducting properties.\n\nThe S atoms have bonds with three Fe and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by [[crystallographic point group|point symmetry groups]] ''C''<sub>3''i''</sub> and ''C''<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The missing [[centrosymmetry|center of inversion]] at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite.

Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions is different from that of pyrite.

This process is hastened by the action of ''[[Acidithiobacillus]]'' bacteria which oxidize the pyrite to produce ferrous iron and sulfate. These reactions occur more rapidly when the pyrite is in fine crystals and dust, which is the form it takes in most mining operations.\n\n===Acid drainage===\n[[Sulfate]] released from decomposing pyrite combines with water, producing [[sulfuric acid]], leading to [[acid rock drainage]]. An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]].\n\n===Dust explosions===\nPyrite oxidation is sufficiently [[exothermic]] that underground [[coal mine]]s in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with [[spontaneous combustion]] in the mined-out areas of the mine. The solution is to [[Hermetic seal|hermetically seal]] the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen.{{citation needed|reason=the referenced book does not contain the word pyrite.

This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion.
