These have included the enterprise-oriented [[Google Talk]] (based on [[XMPP]]), [[Google+]] Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which provided chat, voice, videoconferencing features. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as [[Facebook Messenger]], [[iMessage]], and [[WhatsApp]]. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.<ref name=verge-hangouts>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Inside Hangouts, Google's big fix for its messaging mess|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess|website=The Verge|accessdate=May 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003094853/http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess|archive-date=October 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing reports that the new service would be known as \"Babel\", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the [[Google I/O]] conference on May 15, 2013.<ref name=verge-hangouts/><ref name=engadget-babel>{{cite web|title=Google's rumored Babel chat service will reportedly launch as Hangouts|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/10/google-babel-to-become-hangouts-chat-system/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=May 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607183041/http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/10/google-babel-to-become-hangouts-chat-system/|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2015, Google announced it would be discontinuing Google Talk and instructed users to migrate to the Hangouts app on the Chrome browser platform.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Talk Discontinued;

These have included the enterprise-oriented [[Google Talk]] (based on [[XMPP]]), [[Google+]] Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which provided chat, voice, videoconferencing features. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as [[Facebook Messenger]], [[iMessage]], and [[WhatsApp]].

Pay was credited with the late season revival as the side focused heavily on defence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/spoons-of-wood-high-hopes-and-chances-lost-the-final-round-storylines-20190905-p52o87.html/|title=Spoons of wood, high hopes and chances lost... the final round storylines|website=Brisbane Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/09/01/the-dean-pay-way-unashamedly-old-school/|title=The Dean Pay way: 'Unashamedly' old school|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nOn 10 March 2020, Okunbor was stood down by Canterbury just two days before the start of the [[2020 NRL season]] after it was alleged he met two girls during a school visit on a pre-season trip to Port Macquarie earlier in March along with teammate [[Corey Harawira-Naera]], whilst a sexual encounter was alleged to occur, the school girls were of the age of consent and there was no criminal investigation pending.

In a leaked message obtained through Fox Sports, Okunbor said to the school girl \"Yeah had to have a good look, what are we doing tonight?, Okay, okay, we\u2019re you at the school today? and Show tits?\".  It was also revealed one of the two players sanctioned had sexual intercourse with a teacher from another school during the same pre-season trip.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/bulldogs/were-you-at-the-school-today-messages-between-axed-dogs-star-and-teen-revealed/news-story/c59f85f9c2d7f10547db3e230e65798a/|title=Were you at school today messages between axed Canterbury star and teen revealed|website=www.foxsports.com.au}}</ref>\n\nOn the same day, it was revealed that because of the two players actions, new major sponsor Rashays had cancelled their $2 million sponsorship with the club.  Rashays had signed on to become Canterbury's front of shirt sponsor.  Rashays owner Rami Ykmour released a statement saying \"It\u2019s a shame two players could wreck it for everyone, It\u2019s disgusting. It's repulsive, to be honest. That\u2019s something else.

Canterbury released a statement saying \u201cThe NRL have today deregistered both Jayden Okunbor and Corey Harawira-Naera with immediate effect and as a result their playing contracts with the Bulldogs have been cancelled, The conduct of the two players, on the eve of our final trial match, demonstrated an unacceptable lack of respect for their teammates, their coach and club officials, our hosts in Port Macquarie and fans of the game everywhere\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/bulldogs/nrl-2020-canterburybankstown-bulldogs-jayden-okunbor-corey-harawiranaera-sacked-schoolgirl-sex-scandal-instagram-snapchat-photos/news-story/c42bb7b1a01484231af1e88c7c0a8811/|title=Canterbury Bankstown players sacked over schoolgirl sex scandal|website=www.foxsports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.bulldogs.com.au/teams/telstra-premiership/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/jayden-okunbor/ Bulldogs profile]\n\n{{Canterbury Bulldogs squad}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Okunbor, Jayden}}\n[[Category:1997 births]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league players]]\n[[Category:Australian people of Nigerian descent]]\n[[Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players]]\n[[Category:Rugby league wingers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "1.144.105.171", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Okunbor"}

Established only four years after the nearby ''[[Great German Synagogue|Scuola Grande Tedesca]]'' (1528), it is the second oldest Venetian synagogue.{{sfn|Davis|Ravid|2001|p=43}}{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}} Its origins are uncertain: it might have been constructed as a prayer room for a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, or as a private synagogue for a prominent local family. Repeatedly remodeled throughout its history, its interior is predominantly decorated in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.\n\nThe synagogue was most recently restored in 2016-2017 by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is open to the public through the Jewish Museum of Venice.\n\n==Name==\nLike the other four synagogues in Venice, the Canton Synagogue was termed a ''scuola'' (\"School\") rather than ''sinagoga'' (\"Synagogue\"), in the same way in which Ashkenazi Jews refer to the synagogue as the ''shul'' ({{Script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc}}) in [[Yiddish]]. In the Venetian context, however, the term has a further connotation: ''Scuola'' was in fact the name given to Christian [[confraternity]] institutions devoted to assisting those in need, the most famous being the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice]]. The building of the Canton Synagogue hosted indeed the headquarters of several charitable and aid organizations throughout the centuries, similarly to what happened in the adjacent ''[[Italian Synagogue (Venice)|Scuola Italiana]]''.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=240}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAmong the several proposed etymologies for the word ''Canton'', the generally accepted one links it to the site's ancient toponym, ''canton del medras'' ([[midrash]]'s corner), referring to the building's position in the southern corner of the square of the ''Ghetto Nuovo''.{{efn|Analogously, another corner of the square was called ''canton del forno'' (bakery's corner).{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=105}} }} According to another hypothesis, the word derives from the Canton (or Cantoni) family which allegedly financed the synagogue's construction;{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}}{{sfn|Calimani|2013}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=58}}<ref name=\"canton\">[http://jvenice.org/en/canton-synagogue?jjj=1468490409918 Canton Synagogue].

Evidence suggests that the new synagogue might have been in fact erected by a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, in a period marked by a sharp increase in the Jewish population of Venice due to immigration from nearby countries.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=10\u201312}}{{sfn|Sander|2000|p=513}}{{efn|The number of Jews moving into the Ghetto saw a rapid increase with the outbreak of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], as several Jews who had settled in the Venice mainland chose to seek refuge in the city.}} Proven\u00e7al Jews were forced to [[History of the Jews in Arles|leave en masse Arles]] following the annexation of Provence to France (1484), with many of them opting to settle in Italy.{{sfn|Shulvass|1973|p=7}} Several elements seem to prove the Proven\u00e7al origins of the Canton Synagogue: for instance, it was the only Venetian synagogue where the [[Lekhah Dodi]]\u2014a [[hymn]] commonly intoned by French Jews on the eve of [[Sabbath]]\u2014was sung.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}} Moreover, the synagogue's \"bifocal effect\" (created by the bimah and the [[Torah ark|ark]] facing each other at the opposite ends of the sanctuary), an arrangement rarely seen in old European synagogues, is a common feature of Proven\u00e7al synagogue buildings, such as those of [[Carpentras]] and [[Cavaillon]].{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}}{{efn|The Canton Synagogue and the Cavaillon synagogue, in particular, show several similarities in their arrangements.

An anonymous exterior was an indispensable feature for synagogues built in Venice in the early decades of the sixteenth century, since Jewish places of worship\u2014although tolerated\u2014were still formally prohibited at that time.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=93}} The synagogue stands on an elevated position (a feature shared with the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and ''Scuola Italiana'') in accordance with Talmudic precepts about synagogue architecture;{{sfn|Bleich|1977|p=63}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|2004|p=321}}{{sfn|Levy|1963|pp=29\u201334}} on a more practical note, the parcel where the building sits was owned by a prominent Venetian patrician family,{{efn|The lot of the ''Scuola Canton'' belonged to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Erizzo|it}} family; similarly, the ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and the ''Scuola Italiana'' were built on parcels owned by two wealthy patrician families.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}} }} but the raised placement put the synagogue under the direct control of the Jewish community.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}}\n\nThe first floor entrance to the synagogue building consists of a spacious and luminous [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] divided by two white [[tuscan column]]s; a stairway, lined with nineteenth-century plaques commemorating prominent members of the community, connects it to the third story synagogue. The current look of both the hall and the stairway is the result of a restoration carried out in the late 1850s.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=59}} On the third floor, the synagogue in accessed through a narrow [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] lined with benches; four windows placed on the vestibule's west wall (bricked up in 1847, and reopened in 1980) overlook the main room. The original function of such space\u2014reminiscent of the anteroom (''polish'' in Yiddish) often found in Central European synagogue buildings\u2014is not clear; however, its layout suggests that it may have initially served as a [[matroneum]]. A new raised womens' gallery was completed in 1736: from that moment on, and until 1847, the antechamber is thought to have been used by people unable to afford a seat in the main room. Due to the synagogue's modest dimensions, the number of places was in fact limited: owning a seat was considered a [[status symbol]], and seats were often handed down through generations within prominent families.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=61}}{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=12}}\n\nThe main room features a rectangular plan which is only slightly asymmetrical (12.9 x 7.1 x 12.7 x 6.5 m), in contrast to the marked irregularity of the ground plan in the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca''.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=62}} The synagogue benefits of plenty of natural light thanks to the eleven large windows opening to the outside. The interior, heavily altered by the eighteenth-century interventions, is decorated in the [[Baroque]] style with some [[Rococo]] elements.<ref name=\"museum\"/> The main focal points, the bimah and the ark, are placed at the opposite ends of the sanctuary: this was indeed the first Venetian synagogue to be built with the \"bifocal effect\", as the pulpit of the ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'', later relocated, was originally placed in the middle of the room{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|pp=102, 107}} in accordance with the traditional \"central bimah\" configuration.{{sfn|Turner|1979|p=293}}\n\n[[File:Canton Synagogue, Ark.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The ark]]\nThe intricately decorated ark is entirely gilded, as prescribed in the [[Book of Exodus]] with regard to the [[Ark of the Covenant]];{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=10}}{{efn|\"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about\" (Exodus 25:11); \"And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about\" (Exodus 37:2).}} such abundance of gilt also reflects what was the decorative style in fashion in late seventeenth-century Venice.{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=10}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=65}} The ark occupies a deep niche in the southern wall facing Jerusalem, as typically seen in ancient synagogues.{{sfn|Hachlili|1976|p=43}} The niche protrudes outwards and is thus visible from the outside; such feature, characteristic of Venetian domestic architecture and once commonly seen in buildings throughout the city, is called ''liag\u00f2'' (or ''diag\u00f2'') and probably derived from [[Islamic architecture]].{{sfn|Calimani|Sullam Reinisch|Vivante|2000|p=24}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=66}}<ref>[http://jvenice.org/en/great-german-synagogue/item/scola-grande-tedesca?jjj=1572028308757 Great German Synagogue].

Repeatedly remodeled throughout its history, its interior is predominantly decorated in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.\n\nThe synagogue was most recently restored in 2016-2017 by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is open to the public through the Jewish Museum of Venice.\n\n==Name==\nLike the other four synagogues in Venice, the Canton Synagogue was termed a ''scuola'' (\"School\") rather than ''sinagoga'' (\"Synagogue\"), in the same way in which Ashkenazi Jews refer to the synagogue as the ''shul'' ({{Script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc}}) in [[Yiddish]]. In the Venetian context, however, the term has a further connotation: ''Scuola'' was in fact the name given to Christian [[confraternity]] institutions devoted to assisting those in need, the most famous being the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice]]. The building of the Canton Synagogue hosted indeed the headquarters of several charitable and aid organizations throughout the centuries, similarly to what happened in the adjacent ''[[Italian Synagogue (Venice)|Scuola Italiana]]''.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=240}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAmong the several proposed etymologies for the word ''Canton'', the generally accepted one links it to the site's ancient toponym, ''canton del medras'' ([[midrash]]'s corner), referring to the building's position in the southern corner of the square of the ''Ghetto Nuovo''.{{efn|Analogously, another corner of the square was called ''canton del forno'' (bakery's corner).{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=105}} }} According to another hypothesis, the word derives from the Canton (or Cantoni) family which allegedly financed the synagogue's construction;{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}}{{sfn|Calimani|2013}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=58}}<ref name=\"canton\">[http://jvenice.org/en/canton-synagogue?jjj=1468490409918 Canton Synagogue].

Evidence suggests that the new synagogue might have been in fact erected by a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, in a period marked by a sharp increase in the Jewish population of Venice due to immigration from nearby countries.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=10\u201312}}{{sfn|Sander|2000|p=513}}{{efn|The number of Jews moving into the Ghetto saw a rapid increase with the outbreak of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], as several Jews who had settled in the Venice mainland chose to seek refuge in the city.}} Proven\u00e7al Jews were forced to [[History of the Jews in Arles|leave en masse Arles]] following the annexation of Provence to France (1484), with many of them opting to settle in Italy.{{sfn|Shulvass|1973|p=7}} Several elements seem to prove the Proven\u00e7al origins of the Canton Synagogue: for instance, it was the only Venetian synagogue where the [[Lekhah Dodi]]\u2014a [[hymn]] commonly intoned by French Jews on the eve of [[Sabbath]]\u2014was sung.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}} Moreover, the synagogue's \"bifocal effect\" (created by the bimah and the [[Torah ark|ark]] facing each other at the opposite ends of the sanctuary), an arrangement rarely seen in old European synagogues, is a common feature of Proven\u00e7al synagogue buildings, such as those of [[Carpentras]] and [[Cavaillon]].{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}}{{efn|The Canton Synagogue and the Cavaillon synagogue, in particular, show several similarities in their arrangements.

An anonymous exterior was an indispensable feature for synagogues built in Venice in the early decades of the sixteenth century, since Jewish places of worship\u2014although tolerated\u2014were still formally prohibited at that time.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=93}} The synagogue stands on an elevated position (a feature shared with the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and ''Scuola Italiana'') in accordance with Talmudic precepts about synagogue architecture;{{sfn|Bleich|1977|p=63}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|2004|p=321}}{{sfn|Levy|1963|pp=29\u201334}} on a more practical note, the parcel where the building sits was owned by a prominent Venetian patrician family,{{efn|The lot of the ''Scuola Canton'' belonged to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Erizzo|it}} family; similarly, the ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and the ''Scuola Italiana'' were built on parcels owned by two wealthy patrician families.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}} }} but the raised placement put the synagogue under the direct control of the Jewish community.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}}\n\nThe first floor entrance to the synagogue building consists of a spacious and luminous [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] divided by two white [[tuscan column]]s; a stairway, lined with nineteenth-century plaques commemorating prominent members of the community, connects it to the third story synagogue.

The original function of such space\u2014reminiscent of the anteroom (''polish'' in Yiddish) often found in Central European synagogue buildings\u2014is not clear; however, its layout suggests that it may have initially served as a [[matroneum]]. A new raised womens' gallery was completed in 1736: from that moment on, and until 1847, the antechamber is thought to have been used by people unable to afford a seat in the main room. Due to the synagogue's modest dimensions, the number of places was in fact limited: owning a seat was considered a [[status symbol]], and seats were often handed down through generations within prominent families.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=61}}{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=12}}\n\nThe main room features a rectangular plan which is only slightly asymmetrical (12.9 x 7.1 x 12.7 x 6.5 m), in contrast to the marked irregularity of the ground plan in the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca''.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=62}} The synagogue benefits of plenty of natural light thanks to the eleven large windows opening to the outside.

The pulpit stands inside a semi-hexagonal niche, illuminated from above by a dome-shaped skylight, which was built around 1730.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=108}} The wooden seats surrounding the pulpit were originally reserved for the most eminent members of the community.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=66}} The eighteenth-century rearrangement of this section of the synagogue was most assuredly carried out by local Christian architect Bartolomeo Scalfurotto, who in the same period (aroud 1731) was working on the refurbishment of the fa\u00e7ade of the [[Doge's Palace]].{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nPlaced against the room's longer walls are two [[Juglans|walnut]] [[Bench (furniture)|benches]] whose decoration was completed in 1789, together with the [[gilding]] of the synagogue's interior.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=161}} All the walls are subdivided into five horizontal sections; the number five recurs repeatedly throughout the synagogue (five are the openings on the two longer walls, as well as the steps leading to the bimah) as an evidence of its [[Significance of numbers in Judaism|importance in Judaism]].{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=98}}{{efn|Five are the books of the [[Torah]], and the sections of the book of [[Psalms]].}}\n\nTwo of the four walls are noteworthy for the presence of eight wooden panels with relief medallions depicting biblical episodes from the Book of Exodus, including the city of [[Jericho]], the [[Crossing the Red Sea|Crossing of the Red Sea]], the Altar of Sacrifice, the [[Manna]], the [[Ark of the Covenant|Ark]] on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], [[Korah]], the gift of the Torah, and [[Moses]] making water flow from the rock.<ref name=\"museum\"/> The eight medallions, painted in [[tempera]], are of no particular artistic merit, but do stand out for their rarity: [[landscape painting]]s are indeed an extremely uncommon feature in synagogues, and their presence in the Canton Synagogue may reflect the influence of [[Central Europe]]an models.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=66}} The medallions are in fact reminiscent of oval [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]] displayed on the frontispieces of Jewish books printed in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in the late sixteenth century.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=162}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Canton Synagogue, antechamber.jpg|Picture of the vestibule, looking north.
