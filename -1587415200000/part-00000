Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for [[Brad Paisley]]'s single \"[[Start a Band]],\" on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar.

Between the two, Urban also made a guest appearance on then-labelmate [[Emily West]]'s single \"Blue Sky,\" which charted at number 38.\n\nUrban's 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the ''Defying Gravity'' album, featured many big-name opening acts, such as [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sugarland]], and [[Jason Aldean]]. On 27 June 2009, Urban filmed a video for the song, \"Only You Can Love Me This Way\", at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nIn 2009, Urban was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.\n\n===2010\u20132012: ''Get Closer''===\nIn May 2010, Urban entered the studio to begin work on a new album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keithurban.net/index.php?page=album_blog&b_id=17273 |title=Keith Urban |publisher=Keith Urban |accessdate=2 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006164134/http://www.keithurban.net/index.php?page=album_blog&b_id=17273 |archive-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The recording process was documented in a blog on his official website.

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

(SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods.

Initially, dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall [[countertop]] and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.\n\nBy the 1970s, dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the United States and Germany had dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|title=The History of the Dishwasher|publisher=Yellow Advertiser|accessdate=2013-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217185319/http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|archive-date=2014-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, manufacturers began offering various new [[energy conservation]] features in dishwashers.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Janeway|first1=Kimberly|title=5 Things to Know When Replacing a Dishwasher|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/replacing-a-dishwasher-what-to-know/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 December 2016}}</ref> One feature was use of \"soil sensors\", which was a computerized tool in the dishwasher which measured food particles coming from dishes.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> When the dishwasher had cleaned the dishes to the point of not releasing more food particles, then the soil sensor would report the dishes being cleaned.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> If dishes were especially dirty, then the dishwasher would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean.

Portable dishwashers exist in 45 and 60&nbsp;cm (Europe) or {{cvt|18|and|24|in|cm}} (US) widths, with casters and attached countertops. There are also dishwashers available in sizes according to the European [[gastronorm]] standard.<ref>[https://www.cs-catering-equipment.co.uk/catering-appliances/dishwashers-glass-washers Commercial Dishwashers & Glasswashers | CS Catering Equipment]</ref> Dishwashers may come in standard or tall tub designs; standard tub dishwashers have a service kickplate beneath the dishwasher door that allows for simpler maintenance and installation, but tall tub dishwashers have approximately 20% more capacity and better [[Soundproofing|sound dampening]] from having a continuous front door.\nUnder the cabinet, [https://www.shekitchen.com/remove-and-install-lg-dishwasher-free-of-cost/ fix yourself ]dishwashers are most common in the modern kitchen. People prefer countertops as they are comparatively cheap than ones under the cabinet. Meanwhile, dishwasher installation needs little effort to fit yourself. \n\nThe international standard for the capacity of a dishwasher is expressed as standard [[place setting]]s. Commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour. The rating is based on standard-sized plates of the same size. The same can be said for commercial glass washers, as they are based on standard glasses, normally pint glasses.\n\n===Layout===\n\nPresent-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door, allowing access to the interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also be referred to as \"baskets\". In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading as well as removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks, offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit. Most present-day machines allow for placement of dishes, silverware, tall items and cooking utensils in the lower rack, while glassware, cups and saucers are placed in the upper rack. One notable exception were dishwashers produced by the Maytag Corporation from the late sixties until the early nineties. These machines were designed for loading glassware, cups and saucers in the lower rack, while plates, silverware, and tall items were placed into the upper rack. This unique design allowed for a larger capacity and more flexibility in loading of dishes and pots and pans. Today, \"dish drawer\" models eliminate the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models. \"Cutlery baskets\" are also common. A [[drawer dishwasher]], first introduced by [[Fisher & Paykel]] in 1997, is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer [[filing cabinet]], with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other.\n\nThe inside of a dishwasher in the North American market is either [[stainless steel]] or [[plastic]]. Stainless steel tubs resist [[hard water]], and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Older models used baked [[porcelain enamel|enamel]] tubs, while some used a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] coating bonded to a steel tub, which provided protection of the tub from acidic foods and provided some sound attenuation. European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low-end models. The same is true for a built-in [[water softener]].\n\n===Washing elements===\n\nEuropean dishwashers almost universally use two or three spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines, primarily those designed by General Electric, use a wash tube, often called a wash-tower, to direct water from the bottom of the dishwasher to the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] and [[KitchenAid]], use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher and directs water to a second wash arm beneath the upper rack, this allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model [[Frigidaire]] dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Geschirrspuelertv.ogg|thumb|Clear model of a running dishwasher]]\n\nMid- to higher-end North American dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units, which behave like miniature [[garbage disposal unit|garbage (waste) disposal units]] that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water. One manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], a German brand; however, Bosch does so in order to reduce noise. If the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher, pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units.\n\nMany new dishwashers feature [[microprocessor]]-controlled, [[sensor]]-assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the number of dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water [[temperature]]) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically or optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the [[electromechanical]] [[rotary switch]] often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor, but most sensors and [[valve]]s are still required. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no [[cavitation]] it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A [[bimetallic strip|bimetal switch]] or [[wax motor]] opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.\n\nSome dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children. A child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children from opening the door during a wash cycle. This prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle.\nIn fact, almost all modern dishwashers in the market now come with child lock. This is something more like trendy thing and secures as well.\n\n==Process==\n\n===Energy use and water temperatures===\nIn the European Union, the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a [[European Union energy label]]. In the United States, the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the [[energy factor]].\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use a 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) thermostat in the sanitizing process. During the final rinse cycle, the heating element and wash pump are turned on, and the cycle timer (electronic or electromechanical) is stopped until the thermostat is tripped. At this point, the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments.\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) rather than 83&nbsp;\u00b0C (181&nbsp;\u00b0F) for reasons of burn risk, energy and water consumption, total cycle time, and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher. With new advances in detergents, lower water temperatures (50\u201355&nbsp;\u00b0C / 122\u2013131&nbsp;\u00b0F) are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes.\n\nIn the US, residential dishwashers can be certified to a [[NSF International]] testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/consumer/residential_appliances/index.asp?program=ResidentialApp |title=NSF Consumer Information: Residential Appliances and Other Products for the Home |publisher=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Drying===\nThe heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse; the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse-aid to the hot water, as this improves drying significantly by reducing the inherent surface tension of the water. Plastic and non-stick items form drops with smaller surface area<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/ask/curiosities/curiosities-why-does-plastic-dry-slower-than-glass/article_31d0e21a-34df-11e1-bdb3-001871e3ce6c.html | title=Curiosities: Why does plastic dry slower than glass?}}</ref> and may not dry properly compared to china and glass, which also store more heat that better evaporate the little water that remains on them. Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.\n\nNorth American dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element. European machines and some high end North American machines use passive methods for drying \u2013 a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying. Most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such, a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator, usually in the form of an illuminated \"end\" light, or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound, exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over.\n\nGovernmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.es_at_home_tips_renters10 |title=Top 10 Tips for Renters: ENERGY STAR |publisher=Energystar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between dishwashers and hand washing==\n\n===Dishwasher detergent===\n{{Main|Dishwasher detergent}}\n[[File:Detergent tablet.jpg|thumb|A detergent tablet]]\nDishwashers are designed to work using specially formulated [[dishwasher detergent]]. Over time, many regions have banned the use of [[phosphates in detergent]] and phosphorus-based compounds. They were previously used because they have properties that aid in effective cleaning. The concern was the increase in [[algal bloom]]s in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see [[eutrophication]]).<ref name=\"Kogawa 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Kogawa|first1=Ana Carolina|last2=Cernic|first2=Beatriz Gamberini|last3=do Couto|first3=Leandro Giovanni Domingos|last4=Salgado|first4=H\u00e9rida Regina Nunes|title=Synthetic detergents: 100 years of history|journal=Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=25|issue=6|pages=934\u2013938|date=February 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jsps.2017.02.006|pmid=28951681|pmc=5605839}}</ref> Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201805.html |title=Md.

Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geappliances.com/appliances/dishwashers/why-is-there-white-film-on-glassware-dishes-dishwasher-interior.htm |title=Phosphate Free Dishwasher Detergent Leaves Dishes Dirty |publisher=GE Appliances |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, rinse aids have contained [[nonylphenol]] and nonylphenol ethoxylates. These have been banned in the European Union by EU Directive 76/769/EEC.\n\nIn some regions depending on water hardness a dishwasher might function better with the use of a [[dishwasher salt]].\n\n===Glassware===\nGlassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white [[haze]] on the surface over time. This may be caused by any or all of the below processes, of which only the first is reversible:\n; Deposition of minerals: Calcium carbonate ([[limescale]]) in hard water can deposit on surfaces when water dries. The deposits can be dissolved by vinegar or another acid.\n; Silicate filming, etching, and accelerated crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or \"oil-film\" effect on glassware, and progresses into a \"milky\" or \"cloudy\" appearance (which is not a deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and [[Sodium silicate#Properties|glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution]]. It becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) ''less'' marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items' manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/F/20033788.html |title=Lehigh-Unilever study sheds light on mystery of cloudy wineglasses |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03538.x |last1=Sharma |first1=Anju |last2=Jain |first2=Himanshu |last3=Carnali |first3=Joseph O. |last4=Lugo |first4=Guillermo Manuel |title=Influence of the Manufacturing Process on Corrosion Behavior of Soda-Lime-Silicate Glassware |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121107001214/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-07|accessdate= 2010-06-09 |volume=86 |pages=1669\u20131676 |year=2003 |issue=10}}</ref> Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.\n; Dissolution of lead: Lead in [[lead crystal]] can be converted into a soluble form by the high temperatures and strong alkali detergents of dishwashers, which could endanger the health of subsequent users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1997/7/97.07.05.x.html |title=''Lead Contamination In Our Environment'' |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other materials===\nOther materials besides glass are also harmed by the strong detergents, strong agitation, and high temperatures of dishwashers, especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"huffpo\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/wash-dishes_n_7232216.html |title=You Should Pretty Much NEVER Wash Your Dishes By Hand.

Glued items, such as hollow-handle knives or wooden [[cutting board]]s, will melt or soften in a dishwasher; high temperatures and moisture damage wood. High temperatures damage many plastics, especially in the bottom rack close to an exposed [[heating element]] (many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely). Squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape. [[Cast iron]] [[cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat, which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware, thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface which is stripped off by the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water in a dishwasher.\n \nKnives and other cooking tools that are made of [[carbon steel]], semi-stainless steels like D2, or specialized, highly hardened cutlery steels like ZDP189 corrode in the extended moisture bath of dishwashers, compared to briefer baths of hand washing. Cookware is made of [[austenite|austenitic]] stainless steels, which are more stable.\n \nItems contaminated by chemicals such as wax, cigarette ash, poisons, mineral oils, wet paints, oiled tools, furnace filters, etc. can contaminate a dishwasher, since the surfaces inside small water passages cannot be wiped clean as surfaces are in hand-washing, so contaminants remain to affect future loads. Objects contaminated by [[solvent]]s may explode in a dishwasher.\n\n===Environmental comparison===\nDishwashers use less water, and therefore less fuel to heat the water, than hand washing, except for small quantities washed in wash bowls without running water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/05/why-you-shouldnt-wash-your-dishes-by-hand/ |title=Why you shouldn't wash your dishes by hand |last=Mooney |first=Chris |date=2015-05-05 |website=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"star\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers/dishwasher_hand_washing |title=Dishwasher vs. Hand Washing Dishes |website=www.energystar.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"rodale\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/best-way-to-wash-dishes |title=8 Mistakes You're Making Every Time You Wash The Dishes |date=2017-09-05 |website=Rodale's Organic Life |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\nHand-washing techniques vary by individual.

Washing is conducted with 65\u201371&nbsp;\u00b0C / 150\u2013160&nbsp;\u00b0F temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82&nbsp;\u00b0C / 180&nbsp;\u00b0F \"final rinse\" temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either \"high-temp\" or \"low-temp\".\n\nSome commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial [[car wash]], with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber (known widely as a \"rack conveyor\" systems). Single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer, close the doors, start the cycle, and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack, possibly through a second opening into an unloading area.\n\nIn the UK, the [[British Standards Institution]] set standards for dishwashers. In the US, [[NSF International]] (an independent not-for-profit organization) sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot-water sanitizing methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |title=NSF article on dishwashers |publisher=Nsf.org |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522024446/http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |archivedate=2012-05-22 }}</ref> There are many types of commercial dishwashers including under-counter, single tank, conveyor, flight type, and carousel machines.\n\nCommercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit, in that there are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day's kitchen operations.\n\nWater used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply, and is not reusable. The used rinse water empties into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube. The system may first rinse with pure water only and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.\n\nAdditional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank, from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block, to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n\nDishwashers can be used to cook foods at low temperatures, including turkey,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-thanksgiving-2013-cook-turkey-dishwasher-20131120-story.html |title=How to cook your holiday turkey in the dishwasher |last=Harris |first=By Jenn |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\nsalmon, beef, veal, tuna, shrimp, asparagus, spinach, pears, noodles, and couscous.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/08/25/214799882/dishwasher-cooking-make-your-dinner-while-cleaning-the-plates |title=Dishwasher Cooking: Make Your Dinner While Cleaning The Plates |date=2013-08-25 |work=National Public Radio |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cucinare in lavastoviglie : gusto, sostenibilit\u00e0 e risparmio con un metodo rivoluzionario |last=Lisa. |first=Casali |date=2011 |publisher=Gribaudo |isbn=9788858004340 |location=Milano |oclc=898508940}}</ref>\nThe foods are generally sealed in canning jars or oven bags since even a dishwasher cycle without soap can deposit residual soap and rinse aid from previous cycles on unsealed foods.<ref name=\"cr\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news4jax.com/consumer/consumer-reports/things-you-should-never-put-in-the-dishwasher |title=Things you should never put in the dishwasher |last=Kimbleton |first=Nikki |date=2018-08-13 |work=Consumer Reports |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDishwashers also have been documented to be used to clean potatoes, other root vegetables, garden tools, sneakers or trainers,\nsilk flowers,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/dishwasher-hacks-t101125 |title=Did you know your dishwasher could do this?! |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\nsome sporting goods, plastic hairbrushes, baseball caps, plastic toys, toothbrushes, flip-flops,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/house-and-home/household-advice/a662041/the-best-way-to-load-your-dishwasher/ |title=The best way to load your dishwasher |date=2017-05-10 |work=The Good Housekeeping Institute |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\ncontact lens cases, a mesh filter from a range hood, refrigerator shelves and bins,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/17-surprising-items-you-can-throw-dishwasher-t117880 |title=Yes, you can wash golf balls in the dishwasher (and other surprising things) |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\ntoothbrush holder, pet bowls and pet toys.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/home-garden/la-hm-cleaning-your-kitchen-20180825-story.html |title=Turns out your kitchen (not the bathroom!) is the grossest place in the house |last=Herman |first=Valli |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\nCleaning vegetables and plastics is controversial since vegetables can be contaminated by soap and rinse aid from previous cycles and the heat of most standard dishwashers can cause BPA or phthalates to leech out of plastic products.<ref name=\"cr\"/>.

Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water enters the tub by means of an electro-mechanical [[solenoid valve]], and the rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a [[rinse aid|rinse-aid]], a chemical to reduce surface tension of the water, is used to reduce water spots from [[hard water]] or other reasons.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mCgcrvvRIucC&pg=PA62&dq=dishwasher+rinse+aid#v=onepage&q=dishwasher%20rinse%20aid&f=false|title=Handbook of Detergents, Part E: Applications|last=Zoller|first=Uri|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1574447576|location=|pages=60\u201362|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to domestic units, industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where many dishes must be cleaned.

Initially, dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall [[countertop]] and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.\n\nBy the 1970s, dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the United States and Germany had dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|title=The History of the Dishwasher|publisher=Yellow Advertiser|accessdate=2013-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217185319/http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|archive-date=2014-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, manufacturers began offering various new [[energy conservation]] features in dishwashers.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Janeway|first1=Kimberly|title=5 Things to Know When Replacing a Dishwasher|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/replacing-a-dishwasher-what-to-know/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 December 2016}}</ref> One feature was use of \"soil sensors\", which was a computerized tool in the dishwasher which measured food particles coming from dishes.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> When the dishwasher had cleaned the dishes to the point of not releasing more food particles, then the soil sensor would report the dishes being cleaned.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> If dishes were especially dirty, then the dishwasher would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean.

Portable dishwashers exist in 45 and 60&nbsp;cm (Europe) or {{cvt|18|and|24|in|cm}} (US) widths, with casters and attached countertops. There are also dishwashers available in sizes according to the European [[gastronorm]] standard.<ref>[https://www.cs-catering-equipment.co.uk/catering-appliances/dishwashers-glass-washers Commercial Dishwashers & Glasswashers | CS Catering Equipment]</ref> Dishwashers may come in standard or tall tub designs; standard tub dishwashers have a service kickplate beneath the dishwasher door that allows for simpler maintenance and installation, but tall tub dishwashers have approximately 20% more capacity and better [[Soundproofing|sound dampening]] from having a continuous front door.\n\nThe international standard for the capacity of a dishwasher is expressed as standard [[place setting]]s. Commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour. The rating is based on standard-sized plates of the same size. The same can be said for commercial glass washers, as they are based on standard glasses, normally pint glasses.\n\n===Layout===\n\nPresent-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door, allowing access to the interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also be referred to as \"baskets\". In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading as well as removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks, offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit. Most present-day machines allow for placement of dishes, silverware, tall items and cooking utensils in the lower rack, while glassware, cups and saucers are placed in the upper rack. One notable exception were dishwashers produced by the Maytag Corporation from the late sixties until the early nineties. These machines were designed for loading glassware, cups and saucers in the lower rack, while plates, silverware, and tall items were placed into the upper rack. This unique design allowed for a larger capacity and more flexibility in loading of dishes and pots and pans. Today, \"dish drawer\" models eliminate the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models. \"Cutlery baskets\" are also common. A [[drawer dishwasher]], first introduced by [[Fisher & Paykel]] in 1997, is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer [[filing cabinet]], with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other.\n\nThe inside of a dishwasher in the North American market is either [[stainless steel]] or [[plastic]]. Stainless steel tubs resist [[hard water]], and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Older models used baked [[porcelain enamel|enamel]] tubs, while some used a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] coating bonded to a steel tub, which provided protection of the tub from acidic foods and provided some sound attenuation. European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low-end models. The same is true for a built-in [[water softener]].\n\n===Washing elements===\n\nEuropean dishwashers almost universally use two or three spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines, primarily those designed by General Electric, use a wash tube, often called a wash-tower, to direct water from the bottom of the dishwasher to the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] and [[KitchenAid]], use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher and directs water to a second wash arm beneath the upper rack, this allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model [[Frigidaire]] dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Geschirrspuelertv.ogg|thumb|Clear model of a running dishwasher]]\n\nMid- to higher-end North American dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units, which behave like miniature [[garbage disposal unit|garbage (waste) disposal units]] that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water. One manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], a German brand; however, Bosch does so in order to reduce noise. If the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher, pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units.\n\nMany new dishwashers feature [[microprocessor]]-controlled, [[sensor]]-assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the number of dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water [[temperature]]) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically or optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the [[electromechanical]] [[rotary switch]] often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor, but most sensors and [[valve]]s are still required. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no [[cavitation]] it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A [[bimetallic strip|bimetal switch]] or [[wax motor]] opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.\n\nSome dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children. A child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children from opening the door during a wash cycle. This prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle.\n\n==Process==\n\n===Energy use and water temperatures===\nIn the European Union, the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a [[European Union energy label]]. In the United States, the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the [[energy factor]].\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use a 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) thermostat in the sanitizing process. During the final rinse cycle, the heating element and wash pump are turned on, and the cycle timer (electronic or electromechanical) is stopped until the thermostat is tripped. At this point, the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments.\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) rather than 83&nbsp;\u00b0C (181&nbsp;\u00b0F) for reasons of burn risk, energy and water consumption, total cycle time, and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher. With new advances in detergents, lower water temperatures (50\u201355&nbsp;\u00b0C / 122\u2013131&nbsp;\u00b0F) are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes.\n\nIn the US, residential dishwashers can be certified to a [[NSF International]] testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/consumer/residential_appliances/index.asp?program=ResidentialApp |title=NSF Consumer Information: Residential Appliances and Other Products for the Home |publisher=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Drying===\nThe heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse; the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse-aid to the hot water, as this improves drying significantly by reducing the inherent surface tension of the water.

Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.\n\nNorth American dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element. European machines and some high end North American machines use passive methods for drying \u2013 a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying. Most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such, a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator, usually in the form of an illuminated \"end\" light, or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound, exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over.\n\nGovernmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.es_at_home_tips_renters10 |title=Top 10 Tips for Renters: ENERGY STAR |publisher=Energystar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between dishwashers and hand washing==\n\n===Dishwasher detergent===\n{{Main|Dishwasher detergent}}\n[[File:Detergent tablet.jpg|thumb|A detergent tablet]]\nDishwashers are designed to work using specially formulated [[dishwasher detergent]]. Over time, many regions have banned the use of [[phosphates in detergent]] and phosphorus-based compounds. They were previously used because they have properties that aid in effective cleaning. The concern was the increase in [[algal bloom]]s in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see [[eutrophication]]).<ref name=\"Kogawa 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Kogawa|first1=Ana Carolina|last2=Cernic|first2=Beatriz Gamberini|last3=do Couto|first3=Leandro Giovanni Domingos|last4=Salgado|first4=H\u00e9rida Regina Nunes|title=Synthetic detergents: 100 years of history|journal=Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=25|issue=6|pages=934\u2013938|date=February 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jsps.2017.02.006|pmid=28951681|pmc=5605839}}</ref> Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201805.html |title=Md.

Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geappliances.com/appliances/dishwashers/why-is-there-white-film-on-glassware-dishes-dishwasher-interior.htm |title=Phosphate Free Dishwasher Detergent Leaves Dishes Dirty |publisher=GE Appliances |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, rinse aids have contained [[nonylphenol]] and nonylphenol ethoxylates. These have been banned in the European Union by EU Directive 76/769/EEC.\n\nIn some regions depending on water hardness a dishwasher might function better with the use of a [[dishwasher salt]].\n\n===Glassware===\nGlassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white [[haze]] on the surface over time. This may be caused by any or all of the below processes, of which only the first is reversible:\n; Deposition of minerals: Calcium carbonate ([[limescale]]) in hard water can deposit on surfaces when water dries. The deposits can be dissolved by vinegar or another acid.\n; Silicate filming, etching, and accelerated crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or \"oil-film\" effect on glassware, and progresses into a \"milky\" or \"cloudy\" appearance (which is not a deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and [[Sodium silicate#Properties|glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution]]. It becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) ''less'' marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items' manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/F/20033788.html |title=Lehigh-Unilever study sheds light on mystery of cloudy wineglasses |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03538.x |last1=Sharma |first1=Anju |last2=Jain |first2=Himanshu |last3=Carnali |first3=Joseph O. |last4=Lugo |first4=Guillermo Manuel |title=Influence of the Manufacturing Process on Corrosion Behavior of Soda-Lime-Silicate Glassware |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121107001214/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-07|accessdate= 2010-06-09 |volume=86 |pages=1669\u20131676 |year=2003 |issue=10}}</ref> Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.\n; Dissolution of lead: Lead in [[lead crystal]] can be converted into a soluble form by the high temperatures and strong alkali detergents of dishwashers, which could endanger the health of subsequent users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1997/7/97.07.05.x.html |title=''Lead Contamination In Our Environment'' |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other materials===\nOther materials besides glass are also harmed by the strong detergents, strong agitation, and high temperatures of dishwashers, especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"huffpo\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/wash-dishes_n_7232216.html |title=You Should Pretty Much NEVER Wash Your Dishes By Hand.

Glued items, such as hollow-handle knives or wooden [[cutting board]]s, will melt or soften in a dishwasher; high temperatures and moisture damage wood. High temperatures damage many plastics, especially in the bottom rack close to an exposed [[heating element]] (many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely). Squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape. [[Cast iron]] [[cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat, which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware, thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface which is stripped off by the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water in a dishwasher.\n \nKnives and other cooking tools that are made of [[carbon steel]], semi-stainless steels like D2, or specialized, highly hardened cutlery steels like ZDP189 corrode in the extended moisture bath of dishwashers, compared to briefer baths of hand washing. Cookware is made of [[austenite|austenitic]] stainless steels, which are more stable.\n \nItems contaminated by chemicals such as wax, cigarette ash, poisons, mineral oils, wet paints, oiled tools, furnace filters, etc. can contaminate a dishwasher, since the surfaces inside small water passages cannot be wiped clean as surfaces are in hand-washing, so contaminants remain to affect future loads. Objects contaminated by [[solvent]]s may explode in a dishwasher.\n\n===Environmental comparison===\nDishwashers use less water, and therefore less fuel to heat the water, than hand washing, except for small quantities washed in wash bowls without running water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/05/why-you-shouldnt-wash-your-dishes-by-hand/ |title=Why you shouldn't wash your dishes by hand |last=Mooney |first=Chris |date=2015-05-05 |website=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"star\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers/dishwasher_hand_washing |title=Dishwasher vs. Hand Washing Dishes |website=www.energystar.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"rodale\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/best-way-to-wash-dishes |title=8 Mistakes You're Making Every Time You Wash The Dishes |date=2017-09-05 |website=Rodale's Organic Life |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\nHand-washing techniques vary by individual.

Washing is conducted with 65\u201371&nbsp;\u00b0C / 150\u2013160&nbsp;\u00b0F temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82&nbsp;\u00b0C / 180&nbsp;\u00b0F \"final rinse\" temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either \"high-temp\" or \"low-temp\".\n\nSome commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial [[car wash]], with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber (known widely as a \"rack conveyor\" systems). Single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer, close the doors, start the cycle, and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack, possibly through a second opening into an unloading area.\n\nIn the UK, the [[British Standards Institution]] set standards for dishwashers. In the US, [[NSF International]] (an independent not-for-profit organization) sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot-water sanitizing methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |title=NSF article on dishwashers |publisher=Nsf.org |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522024446/http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |archivedate=2012-05-22 }}</ref> There are many types of commercial dishwashers including under-counter, single tank, conveyor, flight type, and carousel machines.\n\nCommercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit, in that there are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day's kitchen operations.\n\nWater used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply, and is not reusable. The used rinse water empties into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube. The system may first rinse with pure water only and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.\n\nAdditional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank, from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block, to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n\nDishwashers can be used to cook foods at low temperatures, including turkey,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-thanksgiving-2013-cook-turkey-dishwasher-20131120-story.html |title=How to cook your holiday turkey in the dishwasher |last=Harris |first=By Jenn |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\nsalmon, beef, veal, tuna, shrimp, asparagus, spinach, pears, noodles, and couscous.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/08/25/214799882/dishwasher-cooking-make-your-dinner-while-cleaning-the-plates |title=Dishwasher Cooking: Make Your Dinner While Cleaning The Plates |date=2013-08-25 |work=National Public Radio |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cucinare in lavastoviglie : gusto, sostenibilit\u00e0 e risparmio con un metodo rivoluzionario |last=Lisa. |first=Casali |date=2011 |publisher=Gribaudo |isbn=9788858004340 |location=Milano |oclc=898508940}}</ref>\nThe foods are generally sealed in canning jars or oven bags since even a dishwasher cycle without soap can deposit residual soap and rinse aid from previous cycles on unsealed foods.<ref name=\"cr\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news4jax.com/consumer/consumer-reports/things-you-should-never-put-in-the-dishwasher |title=Things you should never put in the dishwasher |last=Kimbleton |first=Nikki |date=2018-08-13 |work=Consumer Reports |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDishwashers also have been documented to be used to clean potatoes, other root vegetables, garden tools, sneakers or trainers,\nsilk flowers,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/dishwasher-hacks-t101125 |title=Did you know your dishwasher could do this?! |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\nsome sporting goods, plastic hairbrushes, baseball caps, plastic toys, toothbrushes, flip-flops,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/house-and-home/household-advice/a662041/the-best-way-to-load-your-dishwasher/ |title=The best way to load your dishwasher |date=2017-05-10 |work=The Good Housekeeping Institute |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\ncontact lens cases, a mesh filter from a range hood, refrigerator shelves and bins,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/17-surprising-items-you-can-throw-dishwasher-t117880 |title=Yes, you can wash golf balls in the dishwasher (and other surprising things) |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\ntoothbrush holder, pet bowls and pet toys.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/home-garden/la-hm-cleaning-your-kitchen-20180825-story.html |title=Turns out your kitchen (not the bathroom!) is the grossest place in the house |last=Herman |first=Valli |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\nCleaning vegetables and plastics is controversial since vegetables can be contaminated by soap and rinse aid from previous cycles and the heat of most standard dishwashers can cause BPA or phthalates to leech out of plastic products.<ref name=\"cr\"/>.

{"title_page": "History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon}}\nThe '''History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon''' is one of early settlement by Europeans taking advantage of the rich fishing grounds near [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], and is characterized by periods of conflict between the French and British.\n\nThere is evidence of prehistoric native inhabitants on the islands, but there is no record of native inhabitants at the time of European exploration. Europeans began to regularly visit from the early 16th century and their settlements are some of the oldest in the Americas. At first the [[Basque people|Basque]] fishermen only visited the islands seasonally during the fishing season, by the mid-17th century there were permanent French residents on the islands.\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, British attacks led to the French settlers abandoning the islands, and the British took possession from 1713 to 1763. The French then reclaimed them and settlers returned to live peacefully for 15 years. French support of the [[American Revolution]] led to a British attack and the deportation of the French settlers. Possession of Saint Pierre and Miquelon passed back and forth between France and Great Britain for the next 38 years, as the islands suffered attacks by both countries, voluntary or forced removal of the island's residents, and upheaval associated with the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFrance finally reclaimed the islands after [[Napoleon]]'s second abdication in 1815, and there followed 70 years of prosperity for the French fishing industry and residents. However, political and economic changes led to a slow decline of the fishing industry after the late 19th century. There was a short 13-year economic boom on the island associated with the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]], when Saint Pierre and Miquelon were prominent bases for alcohol smuggling. This boom ended with the end of prohibition in 1933, and the economy sank into depression.\n\nThe islands were an overseas territory of the Nazi-controlled regime of [[Vichy France]] after the fall of France in [[World War II]], and were liberated a year and a half later by [[Free French]] forces in 1941. After the war, the fishing industry continued to languish, and now fish stocks have fallen so low that fishing is severely restricted. Saint Pierre and Miquelon are now trying to diversify their economy into tourism and other areas.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Beothuk]] and [[Dorset (culture)|Paleoeskimo]] or [[Dorset (culture)|Dorset culture]] artifacts have been uncovered on the island Saint-Pierre at Anse \u00e0 Henry, north of the town of Saint-Pierre.\n\nThe [[Beothuk]] painted themselves with red [[ochre]], which was the origin of the term \"Red Indian\". The [[Beothuk]] did not survive long after their first encounters with Europeans.\n\nThe [[Dorset culture]] preceded the [[Inuit]] or [[Thule]] people, and the last remaining [[Dorset]] tribes were destroyed by diseases when they encountered Europeans.\n\nSome of the native artifacts found on the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon date back to 6000 BC. There is no record of native habitation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon by the time that Europeans arrived.\n\nThe [[Mi'kmaq]], a group indigenous to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Canada's [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], use the terms \"Senpir\" for the island of Saint-Pierre, \"Mikliin\" for the island of Miquelon, and \"Wen'juikjikan\" for the capital, [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]].<ref>http://www.oocities.org/pilip/land.htm</ref>\n\n==Exploration==\nThe first map that showed Saint Pierre and Miquelon was the [[Mappa mundi]] of 1500 created by [[Juan de la Cosa]], where they were labelled 'Illa de la Trenidat'. There are some who argue that the 'Green Islands' encountered during the two pre-1472 Portuguese expeditions under [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] and the 1501 Portuguese expedition under his son [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] were St. Pierre and the islands near it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://grandcolombier.com/english/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514074006/http://www.grandcolombier.com/english/ |archive-date=14 May 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A map drawn by [[Johannes Ruysch]] published in 1507 depicts Miquelon, St. Pierre and the surrounding islands, and labelled as Barbatos.\n\n[[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], on 21 October 1520, visited the islands named the St. Pierre island group the '[[Eleven Thousand Virgins]]', as the day marked the feast day of [[St. Ursula]] and her virgin companions.<ref name=\"ban\">{{Google books|M1JIPAN-eJ4C|page=328|Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for 6,600 ...}} By Adrian Room</ref> [[Jacques Cartier]] of France referred to Saint Pierre and Miquelon and the neighboring islands as the 'Islands of Saint-Pierre' in a written report after his visit in 1536. This was the earliest known written reference to the name 'Saint-Pierre'.\n\n[[Alonzo de Santa Cruz]] wrote that the islands of the '[[Eleven Thousand Virgins]]' were the destination of many fishermen from Ireland and Brittany in 1541. The [[Islario]] of [[Jean Alphonse]], a French geographer, which was published in 1544, described St. Pierre and the nearby islands. The first use of the name 'Miquelon' for the large western island in the St. Pierre island group appears in [[Les voyages aventureux du Capitaine Martin de Hoyarsal, habitant du \u00e7ubiburu]] a reference book for sailors known as a \"navigational pilot\", written by Basque seaman [[Martin de Hoyar\u00e7abal]] in 1579.\n\n==Early European settlement==\nDuring the 16th century, the islands were used as a base for the seasonal [[cod]] fishery by the French of [[La Rochelle]], [[Granville (Manche)|Granville]], [[Saint-Malo]] and the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]. When French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] was in Saint-Pierre in 1536 he made note of the French and [[Brittany|Breton]] fishery, writing:\n: ''Nous fumes ausdictes yles sainct Pierre, ou trouvasmes plusieurs navires, tant de France que de Bretaigne, depuis le jour sainct Bernabe, XIe de juing, jusques au XVIe jour dudict moys''\n\nthat is,\n\n: ''We stayed to the so-called Saint-Pierre islands where we found several French and Breton ships, from St. Barnabe's day, 11 June, until 16th day of said month.''\n\nBy this time, Basque, Breton and Norman fishermen had been fishing in the waters off these islands for over 30 years.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/f_presence.html French Presence in Newfoundland: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>There are writings about an island named [[Bacalao]] that was a destination of Basque fisherman in the 15th century, and was also mentioned in Portuguese documents. Some have suggested that [[Bacalao]] was Newfoundland</ref> The name ''Miquelon'' is of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin as this island was used by fishermen from [[Saint-Jean de Luz]].\n\nThe first written evidence of year-round residents on the islands was in a report in 1670 by the first [[intendant]] of [[New France]], [[Jean Talon]], who recorded the presence of thirteen fishermen and four settled residents. By 1687, there were three families living on the islands. A small chapel was built in 1689, and a military post called [[Pointe aux Cannon Battery]] was constructed in 1690 in Saint-Pierre. Saint-Pierre supplied many of the neighboring French fishing communities, such as those in [[Fortune Bay]] and [[Hermitage, Newfoundland and Labrador|Hermitage Bay]]. Tensions arose between seasonal visitors to the islands and those fishermen who had settled permanently on the islands, particularly over access to the shore areas for drying and curing of fish. By the 1690s, there were almost 200 people working on the islands.\nDuring [[King William's War]], from 1689 to 1697, and [[Queen Anne's War]], from 1702 to 1712, there\nwere at least five British attacks on the islands. This led to the abandonment of the islands by many of the French settlers by 1708. Some of the settlers who left migrated to [[Cape Breton Island]], to live in the new French fishing colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]]. The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 brought such wars to an end, and France ceded possession of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, as well as [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\n==British possession==\n{{Main|British West Indies}}\n[[File:Newfoundland1744.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from a 1746 English copy of a map originally prepared by Jaques Nicolas Bellin in Paris in 1744; showing [[Saint Pierre Island|\"St. Peter's\"]], [[Miquelon Island|Miquelon]], [[Grand Colombier]] islands, and the \"St. Peter's Bank\" off the [[Burin Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland (Island)|Newfoundland]].]] \nAfter they took control of the islands in 1713, the British changed the name of St. Pierre to \"Saint Peter's\". The British government commissioned two surveys of their new possessions between 1714 and 1716. A Newfoundland planter and merchant, [[William Taverner (surveyor)|William Taverner]], surveyed the region west of [[Placentia Bay]] for the British Board of Trade. The British Admiralty asked Lieutenant John Gaudy to conduct a cartographic survey of the area in 1716.\n\nSome of the French settlers swore allegiance to Britain, and remained, and for a while ships from [[Saint-Malo]] continued to visit the islands. However, this trade was illegal and eventually ceased. Slowly British and Anglo-American merchants and settlers started to move to the islands. In 1722, the island of Miquelon was sold to Capt. Diamond Sarjeant, a Massachusetts resident, who sold 2/3 of Miquelon to Samuel Cutt of New Hampshire in 1756, and sold the remaining 1/3 of Miquelon to Robert Trail of Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1758.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/pierre_english_period.html The British Period (1714\u20131764): Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.swgc.mun.ca/nfld_history/CO194/CO194-26.htm CO194-26<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1763, after Britain had agreed to return the islands to French possession, [[James Cook]] mapped the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Cook wrote that:\n\n:''The Island is as subject to Fogs as any part in Newfoundland yes if we may credit the late Planters it is very convenient for catching and curing of Codfish.''\n\n==Return to France==\nBy the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, France had lost a good fraction of its North American empire. However, two of the provisions of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] were that France would be granted fishing rights in the waters around Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and provided a refuge or \"abri\" for the fishermen. France asked that these provisions of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] be honored, and Britain agreed to this during the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] negotiations. Britain therefore returned Saint Pierre and Miquelon to France in 1763, and allowed visiting French fishermen to come ashore in Newfoundland to dry their catch.\n\nBetween 1763 and 1778, the islands became a place of refuge for [[Acadian]] deportees from [[Nova Scotia]]. Several of the [[Acadians]] who were given the status of refugees were rich shipowners. Although the Acadians tried to farm the islands, these efforts were mostly unsuccessful and they had to rely more on fishing, and on offering fish-drying and other services to visiting French fishing fleets (principally from [[Saint-Malo]]). The French government made the determination in 1767 that the islands were too small and too poor for the Acadians. France moved the Acadians back to France, settling them in the ports of [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Lorient]] and [[Dunkirk]]. In 1768, the French government changed its mind and sent the Acadians back to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nTrade grew between [[New England]] and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and then with the Newfoundland mainland in various goods. The Newfoundland community of [[Placentia Bay]] had a large fraction of Irish settlers, many of whom were Roman Catholic, which was illegal in Newfoundland until 1784. The Irish Catholics from Placentia Bay would travel to St. Pierre to have their weddings and baptisms performed by Catholic priests. Although the British tried to discourage the trade and contacts between Newfoundland and the islands, they were not successful.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/restoration_france.html The Restoration to France (1763\u20131815): Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Attacks and deportations==\nIn 1778 the islands were attacked by a force led by Newfoundland's Governor [[John Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|John Montagu]] and the population deported by the British as retaliation for French support of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The residents were sent to France and their homes were destroyed. France regained the islands in 1783 after the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and some residents returned to the islands.\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] erupted in 1789, and events on Saint Pierre and Miquelon were not immune to the twists and turns that ensued. In the early spring of 1793, news of the trial and execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] reached the islands. All royal symbols were subsequently removed from Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The Acadian population of Miquelon were loyal to French royalty, and decided to leave the colony for the [[Magdalen Islands]], a small archipelago just north of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThen in May 1793, British hostility to the [[French Revolution]] and the fact that France had declared war on the United Kingdom as part of the [[War of the First Coalition]], led to another British attack on the islands under Captain William Affleck of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]]. The seasonal fishermen and French military forces were deported in 1793, followed by the 950 residents in 1794, who were shipped to Halifax and held for two years.\n\nBritish fishermen took possession of the islands. Only 2 years later, French forces under [[Rear-Admiral de Richery]] attacked the islands in 1796, sinking 80 British vessels. The British abandoned the islands, and the French destroyed the town. After this, the islands remained deserted until 1816.\n[[Image:Miquelon 9.jpg|thumb|250px|The Island of Miquelon]]\n\n==French restoration after Napoleon==\nAlthough the [[Treaty of Amiens|Amiens Treaty]] of 1802 specified that Saint-Pierre and Miquelon would again be returned to France, this agreement did not produce the promised restoration. The islands were finally returned to France after the second abdication of [[Napoleon]] in 1815. French fishermen again took up residence on the island in 1816.\n\nThe French fishing fleet again came to the islands for supplies and to dry and cure their catch. The residents of the islands did a good business, many working as armateurs, or outfitters, for the visiting fishing fleet. About 200 French vessels came to fish in the waters, and as many as 8000 French fishermen came to visit every year from [[St. Malo]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[St. Brieuc]], and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].<ref>''Isles of Romance'', George Allan England, The Century Co., New York, London, 1929</ref> The catch was divided into dried \"saltfish\" for the Caribbean and much of Europe and \"wet-cured\" fish for the French market. This enterprise was supported by a vigorous trade with Newfoundland for bait and other goods.\n\nAlthough there were three large fires in St. Pierre, the islands prospered.\nA post office was created in 1854, a bank in 1889 (\"Banque des \u00celes\") and in 1866 the island administration began a newspaper, named the \"Feuille Officielle\".\n\nThe shore areas of Newfoundland were increasingly frequented by French fishermen for drying their catch. Although the British had intended that the French not erect any permanent structures or live on Newfoundland, the terms of the treaty were ambiguous. French settlements sprung up on the northern coast of Newfoundland, which came to be known as the [[French Shore]], as well on the southern and western coasts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/TheIssueoftheFrenchShoreinNewfoundland.htm |title=The Issue of the French Shore in Newfoundland<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=16 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910040502/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/TheIssueoftheFrenchShoreinNewfoundland.htm |archive-date=10 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Changing times==\n\nThe increasing French presence on the French Shore led to tension between the French and British inhabitants, and extensive negotiations between France and Britain. These negotiations resulted in a convention in 1857 in which Britain agreed to allow French settlements on the French Shore and eventually their exclusive use of this territory. The [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] legislature reacted very negatively to this agreement, and Britain reconsidered. France abandoned its rights as part of the [[Entente Cordiale]] agreement of 1904. One of the aggressive actions taken by Newfoundland was the passage of the [[Bait Act]] in 1887. This reduced the amount of bait available to fishermen on Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Also, the market for \"saltfish\" peaked in 1886 and went into decline. The introduction of steamships meant that fishing vessels were able to return to France with their catch without stopping at Saint Pierre and Miquelon for supplies. These all hurt the economy on Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n\n[[Transatlantic telegraph cable|Submarine trans-Atlantic telegraph cables]] from France in the 19th century typically were routed from the French mainland through stations on Miquelon or St. Pierre, and then on to Nova Scotia or the United States.

The commercial advantages of language and tradition that Saint Pierre and Miquelon employed in their relationships with France and other countries was substantially weakened during this time. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nCompanies merged, and many of the residents left for greener pastures, as the economy withered to one-third of its previous size by 1914. The [[First World War]] resulted in disruptions of supplies from France between 1914 and 1918, and the death of over 100 residents in the trenches of Europe. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Windfall from Prohibition==\nStarting in 1920, the US passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which led to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. As a result, St. Pierre and Miquelon became the [[transshipment]] point for bringing illegal alcohol from Canada into the United States. Some Canadian provinces also experimented with prohibition as well, but alcohol manufacturers in Canada were still allowed to distil liquor for export. A French law forbidding the importation of foreign liquor was repealed in 1922, drastically increasing the alcohol smuggling operations. Canadian whisky, Caribbean rum and legally imported French wines and spirits were the main products smuggled into and then reshipped from the islands. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nMany gangsters including [[Al Capone]] and [[William S.

A new fish processing plant was converted into a warehouse. Additionally, distilleries were set up on the islands. This economic boom lasted until the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933, and was known locally as \"Les Temps de la Fraude\". As quickly as it began, the boom collapsed when [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, leaving a depressed local economy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wortman|first1=Marc|title=This Tiny French Archipelago Became America's Alcohol Warehouse During Prohibition|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/tiny-french-archipelago-became-americas-illegal-warehouse-during-prohibition-180967868/|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nLocal legend holds that Capone regularly visited Saint-Pierre, and a local bar displays a hat alleged to have been his.<ref name=\"spmtours.com\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Campaignbox Vichy France Military in World War II}}\nFrance was defeated in 1940 by [[Nazi Germany]], and Northern France was occupied. Southern France was governed by [[Vichy France]], which collaborated with Germany. Vichy France was nevertheless recognized as the legitimate government of France by neutral countries, including the United States.\n\nGovernor Gilbert de Bournat of St. Pierre adhered to Vichy France, but the islands were in a difficult situation. The islands were dependent on France for subsidies; it is estimated that in the first part of the 20th century, France spent 40 million francs supporting the economy of the islands. Also, a substantial fraction of the French fishing fleet decided not to return to Nazi-controlled France and remained in the harbor of St. Pierre. French General [[Charles de Gaulle]] created [[Free France]], which was recognized by Britain as the government-in-exile of France. Also, the UK and US worried that Saint Pierre and Miquelon under Vichy control could be used by the Axis to spy on Allied shipping, since there was a radio transmitter on St. Pierre that was thought to be sending messages to German submarines.\n\nDuring the early years of World War II, the United States maintained formal relations with Vichy France. Under the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the US was strongly opposed to any change in control of the islands by force. However, Canada (perhaps due to pressure from [[Winston Churchill]]) expressed worries about Vichy forces near Canada. De Gaulle realized that Canada might want to capture Saint Pierre and Miquelon (thereby eliminating French territory so close to [[Quebec]]), so he secretly planned its seizure by Free France. On Christmas Eve 1941, Free French forces (three corvettes and the submarine ''[[French submarine Surcouf|Surcouf]]'', led by Rear-Admiral [[\u00c9mile Muselier]]) \"invaded\" the islands. The Vichy officials immediately surrendered.<ref>[http://worldatwar.net/article/miquelon/ \"Over by Christmas.\" The Liberation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon]</ref>\n\nIt became a major international incident, because the use of military force by Free France was contrary to the Monroe Doctrine. US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Churchill were incensed to learn that de Gaulle had ordered the landings without even consulting them. The United States and Canada both threatened armed intervention, despite Free France being an ally of both countries. However, US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] then disclaimed any further US interest in the islands, and the islands were not critical to any Allied country.<ref>Anglin, D. G.

Other nations joined the French fleet to fish in the waters around the islands. The economy was not as prosperous as it had been, and by the 1960s French government subsidies constituted half the budget of the islands. This led to the reputation of the island residents as being \"the world's most expensive Frenchmen\".\n\nIn the late 1950s De Gaulle offered all French colonies political and financial independence. Saint Pierre and Miquelon chose to remain part of France.\n\nA political leadership crisis in Saint Pierre and Miquelon erupted in 1965. France sent in an armed force of 'gardes mobiles'. In response, the residents of Saint Pierre and Miquelon mounted a three-day general strike in protest of this interference in local affairs.\n\nThe islands became a full ''[[d\u00e9partement d'outre mer]]'' of France in 1976. This status was modified in 1985 and the islands became a territory with special status (''[[collectivit\u00e9 territoriale]] \u00e0 statut particulier'') under pressure from the United States. After the constitutional reform of 2003, it became a ''[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]'', while keeping its particular name of ''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon''.\n\nCanada tried to reduce the codfishing around Newfoundland in the 1970s and 1980s, out of fear of seriously damaging the fish population. The French responded with the \"Codfish Crusade\" and fished in areas that were forbidden. The Canadian government inspected French fishing trawlers and jailed some fishermen. In 1994, France and Canada mutually agreed to reduce the fishing industry in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nTo the consternation of law enforcement officials, there continues to be smuggling of alcohol and tobacco from Saint Pierre and Miquelon to Newfoundland. This illegal trade has a long history and tradition, and is partly driven by a depressed local economy.\n\nAt this point, Saint Pierre and Miquelon represent the sole remaining vestige of France's once vast [[French colonization of the Americas|North American possessions]]. They have always been most important as a fishing centre, being in easy travelling distance of the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], some of the world's richest fishing grounds. However, they are slowly diversifying their economy into tourism and other activities, with the assistance of the French government.\n\nAs a result of an agreement between the European Union and France, the Euro became the legal currency of the French overseas territories of [[French Guiana]], [[R\u00e9union]], Saint Pierre and Miquelon, [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Mayotte]] in 2002.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.grandcolombier.com/english/ GrandColombier.com Project] \u2013 Over 270 historical documents about Saint-Pierre et Miquelon.\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13376a.htm Saint-Pierre and Miquelon] \u2013 Article from the public domain 1912 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.\n\n{{History of North America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Saint Pierre And Miquelon}}\n[[Category:History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon}}\nThe '''History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon''' is one of early settlement by Europeans taking advantage of the rich fishing grounds near [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], and is characterized by periods of conflict between the French and British.\n\nThere is evidence of prehistoric native inhabitants on the islands, but there is no record of native inhabitants at the time of European exploration. Europeans began to regularly visit from the early 16th century and their settlements are some of the oldest in the Americas. At first the [[Basque people|Basque]] fishermen only visited the islands seasonally during the fishing season, by the mid-17th century there were permanent French residents on the islands.\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, British attacks led to the French settlers abandoning the islands, and the British took possession from 1713 to 1763. The French then reclaimed them and settlers returned to live peacefully for 15 years. French support of the [[American Revolution]] led to a British attack and the deportation of the French settlers. Possession of Saint Pierre and Miquelon passed back and forth between France and Great Britain for the next 38 years, as the islands suffered attacks by both countries, voluntary or forced removal of the island's residents, and upheaval associated with the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFrance finally reclaimed the islands after [[Napoleon]]'s second abdication in 1815, and there followed 70 years of prosperity for the French fishing industry and residents. However, political and economic changes led to a slow decline of the fishing industry after the late 19th century. There was a short 13-year economic boom on the island associated with the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]], when Saint Pierre and Miquelon were prominent bases for alcohol smuggling. This boom ended with the end of prohibition in 1933, and the economy sank into depression.\n\nThe islands were an overseas territory of the Nazi-controlled regime of [[Vichy France]] after the fall of France in [[World War II]], and were liberated a year and a half later by [[Free French]] forces in 1941. After the war, the fishing industry continued to languish, and now fish stocks have fallen so low that fishing is severely restricted. Saint Pierre and Miquelon are now trying to diversify their economy into tourism and other areas.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Beothuk]] and [[Dorset (culture)|Paleoeskimo]] or [[Dorset (culture)|Dorset culture]] artifacts have been uncovered on the island Saint-Pierre at Anse \u00e0 Henry, north of the town of Saint-Pierre.\n\nThe [[Beothuk]] painted themselves with red [[ochre]], which was the origin of the term \"Red Indian\". The [[Beothuk]] did not survive long after their first encounters with Europeans.\n\nThe [[Dorset culture]] preceded the [[Inuit]] or [[Thule]] people, and the last remaining [[Dorset]] tribes were destroyed by diseases when they encountered Europeans.\n\nSome of the native artifacts found on the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon date back to 6000 BC. There is no record of native habitation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon by the time that Europeans arrived.\n\nThe [[Mi'kmaq]], a group indigenous to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Canada's [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], use the terms \"Senpir\" for the island of Saint-Pierre, \"Mikliin\" for the island of Miquelon, and \"Wen'juikjikan\" for the capital, [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]].<ref>http://www.oocities.org/pilip/land.htm</ref>\n\n==Exploration==\nThe first map that showed Saint Pierre and Miquelon was the [[Mappa mundi]] of 1500 created by [[Juan de la Cosa]], where they were labelled 'Illa de la Trenidat'.

This was the earliest known written reference to the name 'Saint-Pierre'.\n\n[[Alonzo de Santa Cruz]] wrote that the islands of the '[[Eleven Thousand Virgins]]' were the destination of many fishermen from Ireland and Brittany in 1541. The [[Islario]] of [[Jean Alphonse]], a French geographer, which was published in 1544, described St. Pierre and the nearby islands. The first use of the name 'Miquelon' for the large western island in the St. Pierre island group appears in [[Les voyages aventureux du Capitaine Martin de Hoyarsal, habitant du \u00e7ubiburu]] a reference book for sailors known as a \"navigational pilot\", written by Basque seaman [[Martin de Hoyar\u00e7abal]] in 1579.\n\n==Early European settlement==\nDuring the 16th century, the islands were used as a base for the seasonal [[cod]] fishery by the French of [[La Rochelle]], [[Granville (Manche)|Granville]], [[Saint-Malo]] and the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]. When French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] was in Saint-Pierre in 1536 he made note of the French and [[Brittany|Breton]] fishery, writing:\n: ''Nous fumes ausdictes yles sainct Pierre, ou trouvasmes plusieurs navires, tant de France que de Bretaigne, depuis le jour sainct Bernabe, XIe de juing, jusques au XVIe jour dudict moys''\n\nthat is,\n\n: ''We stayed to the so-called Saint-Pierre islands where we found several French and Breton ships, from St. Barnabe's day, 11 June, until 16th day of said month.''\n\nBy this time, Basque, Breton and Norman fishermen had been fishing in the waters off these islands for over 30 years.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/f_presence.html French Presence in Newfoundland: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>There are writings about an island named [[Bacalao]] that was a destination of Basque fisherman in the 15th century, and was also mentioned in Portuguese documents. Some have suggested that [[Bacalao]] was Newfoundland</ref> The name ''Miquelon'' is of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin as this island was used by fishermen from [[Saint-Jean de Luz]].\n\nThe first written evidence of year-round residents on the islands was in a report in 1670 by the first [[intendant]] of [[New France]], [[Jean Talon]], who recorded the presence of thirteen fishermen and four settled residents. By 1687, there were three families living on the islands. A small chapel was built in 1689, and a military post called [[Pointe aux Cannon Battery]] was constructed in 1690 in Saint-Pierre. Saint-Pierre supplied many of the neighboring French fishing communities, such as those in [[Fortune Bay]] and [[Hermitage, Newfoundland and Labrador|Hermitage Bay]]. Tensions arose between seasonal visitors to the islands and those fishermen who had settled permanently on the islands, particularly over access to the shore areas for drying and curing of fish. By the 1690s, there were almost 200 people working on the islands.\nDuring [[King William's War]], from 1689 to 1697, and [[Queen Anne's War]], from 1702 to 1712, there\nwere at least five British attacks on the islands. This led to the abandonment of the islands by many of the French settlers by 1708. Some of the settlers who left migrated to [[Cape Breton Island]], to live in the new French fishing colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]]. The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 brought such wars to an end, and France ceded possession of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, as well as [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\n==British possession==\n{{Main|British West Indies}}\n[[File:Newfoundland1744.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from a 1746 English copy of a map originally prepared by Jaques Nicolas Bellin in Paris in 1744; showing [[Saint Pierre Island|\"St. Peter's\"]], [[Miquelon Island|Miquelon]], [[Grand Colombier]] islands, and the \"St. Peter's Bank\" off the [[Burin Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland (Island)|Newfoundland]].]] \nAfter they took control of the islands in 1713, the British changed the name of St. Pierre to \"Saint Peter's\". The British government commissioned two surveys of their new possessions between 1714 and 1716. A Newfoundland planter and merchant, [[William Taverner (surveyor)|William Taverner]], surveyed the region west of [[Placentia Bay]] for the British Board of Trade. The British Admiralty asked Lieutenant John Gaudy to conduct a cartographic survey of the area in 1716.\n\nSome of the French settlers swore allegiance to Britain, and remained, and for a while ships from [[Saint-Malo]] continued to visit the islands. However, this trade was illegal and eventually ceased. Slowly British and Anglo-American merchants and settlers started to move to the islands. In 1722, the island of Miquelon was sold to Capt. Diamond Sarjeant, a Massachusetts resident, who sold 2/3 of Miquelon to Samuel Cutt of New Hampshire in 1756, and sold the remaining 1/3 of Miquelon to Robert Trail of Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1758.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/pierre_english_period.html The British Period (1714\u20131764): Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.swgc.mun.ca/nfld_history/CO194/CO194-26.htm CO194-26<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1763, after Britain had agreed to return the islands to French possession, [[James Cook]] mapped the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Cook wrote that:\n\n:''The Island is as subject to Fogs as any part in Newfoundland yes if we may credit the late Planters it is very convenient for catching and curing of Codfish.''\n\n==Return to France==\nBy the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, France had lost a good fraction of its North American empire. However, two of the provisions of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] were that France would be granted fishing rights in the waters around Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and provided a refuge or \"abri\" for the fishermen. France asked that these provisions of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] be honored, and Britain agreed to this during the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] negotiations. Britain therefore returned Saint Pierre and Miquelon to France in 1763, and allowed visiting French fishermen to come ashore in Newfoundland to dry their catch.\n\nBetween 1763 and 1778, the islands became a place of refuge for [[Acadian]] deportees from [[Nova Scotia]]. Several of the [[Acadians]] who were given the status of refugees were rich shipowners. Although the Acadians tried to farm the islands, these efforts were mostly unsuccessful and they had to rely more on fishing, and on offering fish-drying and other services to visiting French fishing fleets (principally from [[Saint-Malo]]). The French government made the determination in 1767 that the islands were too small and too poor for the Acadians. France moved the Acadians back to France, settling them in the ports of [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Lorient]] and [[Dunkirk]]. In 1768, the French government changed its mind and sent the Acadians back to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nTrade grew between [[New England]] and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and then with the Newfoundland mainland in various goods. The Newfoundland community of [[Placentia Bay]] had a large fraction of Irish settlers, many of whom were Roman Catholic, which was illegal in Newfoundland until 1784. The Irish Catholics from Placentia Bay would travel to St. Pierre to have their weddings and baptisms performed by Catholic priests. Although the British tried to discourage the trade and contacts between Newfoundland and the islands, they were not successful.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/restoration_france.html The Restoration to France (1763\u20131815): Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Attacks and deportations==\nIn 1778 the islands were attacked by a force led by Newfoundland's Governor [[John Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|John Montagu]] and the population deported by the British as retaliation for French support of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The residents were sent to France and their homes were destroyed. France regained the islands in 1783 after the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and some residents returned to the islands.\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] erupted in 1789, and events on Saint Pierre and Miquelon were not immune to the twists and turns that ensued. In the early spring of 1793, news of the trial and execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] reached the islands. All royal symbols were subsequently removed from Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The Acadian population of Miquelon were loyal to French royalty, and decided to leave the colony for the [[Magdalen Islands]], a small archipelago just north of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThen in May 1793, British hostility to the [[French Revolution]] and the fact that France had declared war on the United Kingdom as part of the [[War of the First Coalition]], led to another British attack on the islands under Captain William Affleck of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]]. The seasonal fishermen and French military forces were deported in 1793, followed by the 950 residents in 1794, who were shipped to Halifax and held for two years.\n\nBritish fishermen took possession of the islands. Only 2 years later, French forces under [[Rear-Admiral de Richery]] attacked the islands in 1796, sinking 80 British vessels. The British abandoned the islands, and the French destroyed the town. After this, the islands remained deserted until 1816.\n[[Image:Miquelon 9.jpg|thumb|250px|The Island of Miquelon]]\n\n==French restoration after Napoleon==\nAlthough the [[Treaty of Amiens|Amiens Treaty]] of 1802 specified that Saint-Pierre and Miquelon would again be returned to France, this agreement did not produce the promised restoration. The islands were finally returned to France after the second abdication of [[Napoleon]] in 1815. French fishermen again took up residence on the island in 1816.\n\nThe French fishing fleet again came to the islands for supplies and to dry and cure their catch. The residents of the islands did a good business, many working as armateurs, or outfitters, for the visiting fishing fleet. About 200 French vessels came to fish in the waters, and as many as 8000 French fishermen came to visit every year from [[St. Malo]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[St. Brieuc]], and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].<ref>''Isles of Romance'', George Allan England, The Century Co., New York, London, 1929</ref> The catch was divided into dried \"saltfish\" for the Caribbean and much of Europe and \"wet-cured\" fish for the French market. This enterprise was supported by a vigorous trade with Newfoundland for bait and other goods.\n\nAlthough there were three large fires in St. Pierre, the islands prospered.\nA post office was created in 1854, a bank in 1889 (\"Banque des \u00celes\") and in 1866 the island administration began a newspaper, named the \"Feuille Officielle\".\n\nThe shore areas of Newfoundland were increasingly frequented by French fishermen for drying their catch. Although the British had intended that the French not erect any permanent structures or live on Newfoundland, the terms of the treaty were ambiguous. French settlements sprung up on the northern coast of Newfoundland, which came to be known as the [[French Shore]], as well on the southern and western coasts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/TheIssueoftheFrenchShoreinNewfoundland.htm |title=The Issue of the French Shore in Newfoundland<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=16 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910040502/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/TheIssueoftheFrenchShoreinNewfoundland.htm |archive-date=10 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Changing times==\n\nThe increasing French presence on the French Shore led to tension between the French and British inhabitants, and extensive negotiations between France and Britain. These negotiations resulted in a convention in 1857 in which Britain agreed to allow French settlements on the French Shore and eventually their exclusive use of this territory. The [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] legislature reacted very negatively to this agreement, and Britain reconsidered. France abandoned its rights as part of the [[Entente Cordiale]] agreement of 1904. One of the aggressive actions taken by Newfoundland was the passage of the [[Bait Act]] in 1887. This reduced the amount of bait available to fishermen on Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Also, the market for \"saltfish\" peaked in 1886 and went into decline. The introduction of steamships meant that fishing vessels were able to return to France with their catch without stopping at Saint Pierre and Miquelon for supplies. These all hurt the economy on Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n\n[[Transatlantic telegraph cable|Submarine trans-Atlantic telegraph cables]] from France in the 19th century typically were routed from the French mainland through stations on Miquelon or St. Pierre, and then on to Nova Scotia or the United States. The first was laid in 1869 from the lighthouse at [[Le Minou]] on the north side of the entrance to the narrows leading to the [[Brest, France|Brest]] harbor in France to St. Pierre, and then on to [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1869French/brest.htm Cordeli\u00e8re \u2013 10<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Subsequent transoceanic cables came ashore at [[D\u00e9olen]], 17 km west of Brest.

The commercial advantages of language and tradition that Saint Pierre and Miquelon employed in their relationships with France and other countries was substantially weakened during this time. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nCompanies merged, and many of the residents left for greener pastures, as the economy withered to one-third of its previous size by 1914. The [[First World War]] resulted in disruptions of supplies from France between 1914 and 1918, and the death of over 100 residents in the trenches of Europe. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Windfall from Prohibition==\nStarting in 1920, the US passed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which led to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. As a result, St. Pierre and Miquelon became the [[transshipment]] point for bringing illegal alcohol from Canada into the United States. Some Canadian provinces also experimented with prohibition as well, but alcohol manufacturers in Canada were still allowed to distil liquor for export. A French law forbidding the importation of foreign liquor was repealed in 1922, drastically increasing the alcohol smuggling operations. Canadian whisky, Caribbean rum and legally imported French wines and spirits were the main products smuggled into and then reshipped from the islands. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nMany gangsters including [[Al Capone]] and [[William S. McCoy|Bill McCoy]] set up operations in the islands, using them as a base to smuggle alcohol into the US.<ref name=\"spmtours.com\">http://www.spmtours.com/dayandvacation.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803161419/http://www.spmtours.com/dayandvacation.html |date=3 August 2008 }} and http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/08/12/nf_capone990812.html</ref> Fishermen and armateurs gave up their regular jobs to unload alcohol from Canada, Europe and Bermuda and store it in warehouses. A new fish processing plant was converted into a warehouse. Additionally, distilleries were set up on the islands. This economic boom lasted until the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933, and was known locally as \"Les Temps de la Fraude\". As quickly as it began, the boom collapsed when [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, leaving a depressed local economy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wortman|first1=Marc|title=This Tiny French Archipelago Became America's Alcohol Warehouse During Prohibition|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/tiny-french-archipelago-became-americas-illegal-warehouse-during-prohibition-180967868/|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nLocal legend holds that Capone regularly visited Saint-Pierre, and a local bar displays a hat alleged to have been his.<ref name=\"spmtours.com\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Campaignbox Vichy France Military in World War II}}\nFrance was defeated in 1940 by [[Nazi Germany]], and Northern France was occupied. Southern France was governed by [[Vichy France]], which collaborated with Germany. Vichy France was nevertheless recognized as the legitimate government of France by neutral countries, including the United States.\n\nGovernor Gilbert de Bournat of St. Pierre adhered to Vichy France, but the islands were in a difficult situation. The islands were dependent on France for subsidies; it is estimated that in the first part of the 20th century, France spent 40 million francs supporting the economy of the islands. Also, a substantial fraction of the French fishing fleet decided not to return to Nazi-controlled France and remained in the harbor of St. Pierre. French General [[Charles de Gaulle]] created [[Free France]], which was recognized by Britain as the government-in-exile of France. Also, the UK and US worried that Saint Pierre and Miquelon under Vichy control could be used by the Axis to spy on Allied shipping, since there was a radio transmitter on St. Pierre that was thought to be sending messages to German submarines.\n\nDuring the early years of World War II, the United States maintained formal relations with Vichy France. Under the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the U.S. was strongly opposed to any change in control of the islands by force. However, Canada (perhaps due to pressure from [[Winston Churchill]]) expressed worries about Vichy forces near Canada. De Gaulle realized that Canada might want to capture Saint Pierre and Miquelon (thereby eliminating French territory so close to [[Quebec]]), so he secretly planned its seizure by Free France. On Christmas Eve 1941, Free French forces (three corvettes and the submarine ''[[French submarine Surcouf|Surcouf]]'', led by Rear-Admiral [[\u00c9mile Muselier]]) \"invaded\" the islands. The Vichy officials immediately surrendered.<ref>[http://worldatwar.net/article/miquelon/ \"Over by Christmas.\" The Liberation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon]</ref>\n\nIt became a major international incident, because the use of military force by Free France was contrary to the Monroe Doctrine. US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Churchill were incensed to learn that de Gaulle had ordered the landings without even consulting them. The United States and Canada both threatened armed intervention, despite Free France being an ally of both countries. However, US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] then disclaimed any further U.S interest in the islands, and the islands were not critical to any Allied country.<ref>Anglin, D. G.

Losses were heavy; French Commander Roger Birot was killed, as were 58 French and 6 British sailors.

Other nations joined the French fleet to fish in the waters around the islands. The economy was not as prosperous as it had been, and by the 1960s French government subsidies constituted half the budget of the islands. This led to the reputation of the island residents as being \"the world's most expensive Frenchmen\".\n\nIn the late 1950s De Gaulle offered all French colonies political and financial independence. Saint Pierre and Miquelon chose to remain part of France.\n\nA political leadership crisis in Saint Pierre and Miquelon erupted in 1965. France sent in an armed force of 'gardes mobiles'. In response, the residents of Saint Pierre and Miquelon mounted a three-day general strike in protest of this interference in local affairs.\n\nThe islands became a full ''[[d\u00e9partement d'outre mer]]'' of France in 1976. This status was modified in 1985 and the islands became a territory with special status (''[[collectivit\u00e9 territoriale]] \u00e0 statut particulier'') under pressure from the United States. After the constitutional reform of 2003, it became a ''[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]'', while keeping its particular name of ''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon''.\n\nCanada tried to reduce the codfishing around Newfoundland in the 1970s and 1980s, out of fear of seriously damaging the fish population. The French responded with the \"Codfish Crusade\" and fished in areas that were forbidden. The Canadian government inspected French fishing trawlers and jailed some fishermen. In 1994, France and Canada mutually agreed to reduce the fishing industry in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nTo the consternation of law enforcement officials, there continues to be smuggling of alcohol and tobacco from Saint Pierre and Miquelon to Newfoundland. This illegal trade has a long history and tradition, and is partly driven by a depressed local economy.\n\nAt this point, Saint Pierre and Miquelon represent the sole remaining vestige of France's once vast [[French colonization of the Americas|North American possessions]]. They have always been most important as a fishing centre, being in easy travelling distance of the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], some of the world's richest fishing grounds. However, they are slowly diversifying their economy into tourism and other activities, with the assistance of the French government.\n\nAs a result of an agreement between the European Union and France, the Euro became the legal currency of the French overseas territories of [[French Guiana]], [[R\u00e9union]], Saint Pierre and Miquelon, [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Mayotte]] in 2002.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.grandcolombier.com/english/ GrandColombier.com Project] \u2013 Over 270 historical documents about Saint-Pierre et Miquelon.\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13376a.htm Saint-Pierre and Miquelon] \u2013 Article from the public domain 1912 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.\n\n{{History of North America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Saint Pierre And Miquelon}}\n[[Category:History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon| ]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWorld War II:consistency", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon"}

The Wolverines competed in the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fifth season.\n\nComing off a [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] appearance in [[2018 Michigan Wolverines football team|2018]], Michigan began the year as slight favorites to win the Big Ten Conference, and were ranked seventh in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. Under the leadership of new offensive coordinator [[Josh Gattis]], the Wolverine offense struggled in the early part of the season. In the second game of the year, Michigan escaped with an overtime win against [[2019 Army Black Knights football team|Army]]. Two weeks later, the team was soundly defeated by [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 35\u201314. Analysts saw as a turning point for the offense its second half performance against then-No. 7 [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but their comeback attempt failed as they lost 28\u201321.

The Wolverines competed in the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fifth season.\n\nComing off a [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] appearance in [[2018 Michigan Wolverines football team|2018]], Michigan began the year as slight favorites to win the Big Ten Conference, and were ranked seventh in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. Under the leadership of new offensive coordinator [[Josh Gattis]], the Wolverine offense struggled in the early part of the season. In the second game of the year, Michigan escaped with an overtime win against [[2019 Army Black Knights football team|Army]]. Two weeks later, the team was soundly defeated by [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 35\u201314. Analysts saw as a turning point for the offense its second half performance against then-No. 7 [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but their comeback attempt failed as they lost 28\u201321. The team defeated rivals [[2019 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] and [[2019 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] in blowouts at home, but ended the regular season with a loss to [[2019 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], their eighth straight loss in the series. Michigan was invited to the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] to play [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], where they lost 35\u201316 to end the year at 9\u20134, 6\u20133 in Big Ten play.\n\nThe offense was led by senior quarterback [[Shea Patterson]], who became just the third Wolverine passer to ever eclipse the 3,000 yards passing mark. Offensive linemen [[Ben Bredeson]] and Jon Runyan were both named first-team all-conference.
