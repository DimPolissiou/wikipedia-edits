Regarding the song in the film, [[Roger Ebert]] says in his March 9, 1979 review: \"It [the film] ends on a curious note: The singing of 'God Bless America'. I won't tell you how it arrives at that particular moment... but I do want to observe that the lyrics of 'God Bless America' have never before seemed to me to contain such an infinity of possible meanings, some tragic, some unspeakably sad, some few still defiantly hopeful\".\n* The song is prominently featured in the 1984 film ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', where it is played during a murder at the beginning of the picture.\n* In a 1971 episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'', \"Flashback: Mike Meets Archie\", when Archie Bunker gets disgusted with Mike \"Meathead\" Stivic's liberal viewpoints, he stands up and sings a butchered version of \"God Bless America\" while Stivic screams at him.\n\n==Chart history==\n;Kate Smith\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1939)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|}\n;Connie Francis\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1959-60)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19600102.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, January 2, 1960]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|}\n;LeAnn Rimes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2001-02)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 Singles Sales\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|}\n;Daniel Rodriguez\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2001-02)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|99\n|-\n|}\n\n===Parodies===\nThe song has spawned numerous parodies.\n\n* An irreverent version of the lyrics was printed in the book ''The Mad World of [[William Gaines|William M.

The reference is a play on the name of Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], whose first name is the source for the name \"[[The Americas|America]]\" for the New World.\n* In the title track of their album ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', [[The Firesign Theatre]] briefly break into lines based on the song:  \"Ask the postman.

The song for many years was performed by [[Florence Henderson]], a native Hoosier, and a friend of the Hulman-George family, the track's owners.

The live version, on ''America: A Tribute to Heroes'', is from the telethon event of the same name that took place on September 21, 2001. The studio version is on the ''God Bless America'' album, a patriotic songs CD. It was recorded on September 20, 2001, the day before the American telethon.

Regarding the song in the film, [[Roger Ebert]] says in his March 9, 1979 review: \"It [the film] ends on a curious note: The singing of 'God Bless America'. I won't tell you how it arrives at that particular moment... but I do want to observe that the lyrics of 'God Bless America' have never before seemed to me to contain such an infinity of possible meanings, some tragic, some unspeakably sad, some few still defiantly hopeful\".\n* The song is prominently featured in the 1984 film ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', where it is played during a murder at the beginning of the picture.\n* In a 1971 episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'', \"Flashback: Mike Meets Archie\", when Archie Bunker gets disgusted with Mike \"Meathead\" Stivic's liberal viewpoints, he stands up and sings a butchered version of \"God Bless America\" while Stivic screams at him.\n\n==Chart history==\n;Kate Smith\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1939)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|}\n;Connie Francis\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1959-60)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19600102.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, January 2, 1960]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|}\n;LeAnn Rimes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2001-02)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 Singles Sales\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|}\n;Daniel Rodriguez\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2001-02)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|99\n|-\n|}\n\n===Parodies===\nThe song has spawned numerous parodies.\n\n* An irreverent version of the lyrics was printed in the book ''The Mad World of [[William Gaines|William M.

[[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]]'s veteran art editor, John Putnam, had prepared some copy and sent it to the printers; the word \"[[America]]\" was [[Syllabification|divided]], with a [[hyphen]], at the end of one line. The copy was returned to Putnam by the [[typesetting]] foreman, who explained that his [[labor union|union]] had a rule forbidding the splitting of that word. Putnam obliged, rewriting the copy and sending it back with this enclosure:\n\n::Don't break \"America\";\n::Land we extol;\n::Don't deface it;\n::Upper-case it;\n::Keep it clean, keep it pure, keep it whole;\n::In [[Bodoni]], in [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]],\n::In [[Blackletter|Old English]], in [[Kabel (typeface)|Cabell]] {{[[sic]]}}--\n::Don't break \"America\"--\n::Or we'll\u2014raise\u2014hell!{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n*In \"Temporarily Humboldt County\" on [[The Firesign Theatre]]'s first album ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', a group of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] men briefly and ironically sing \"God bless Vespucciland...\" to the tune of \"God Bless America\" as they fade off into the distance. The reference is a play on the name of Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], whose first name is the source for the name \"[[The Americas|America]]\" for the New World.\n* In the title track of their album ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', [[The Firesign Theatre]] briefly break into lines based on the song:  \"Ask the postman. Ask the mailman. Ask the milkman...white with foam.\"\n* ''[[God Bless America (film)|God Bless America]]'', a 2011 film written and directed by [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], is a dark comedy that satirizes the present-day American values. The story revolves around a loveless, jobless, possibly terminally ill man and his 16-year-old female companion, who go on a [[killing spree]] against what they consider the stupidest, cruelest, and most repugnant members of American society.\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General References\n*Collins, Ace.

The bourgeoisie, or bourgeois [[Communes in Switzerland|''commune'']] (i.e., municipality), is a local \"community\" that still exists in certain [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], where inhabitants originating from that specific [[Communes in Switzerland|municipality]], called old bourgeois, as opposed to the new inhabitants, participate. This current bourgeoisie system, which can be dated back to the law on the communes of 1866, has gradually lost importance. However, these institutions still manage some hospitals and, in some cantons, confer a \"right to bourgeoisie\u201d, sometimes prior to the Swiss [[naturalization]].
