His career with Chicago has seen the release of thirteen albums, several of them certified as platinum.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialGigList\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nAside from a brief, early, move to Germany, Tris Imboden was born and raised in various beachside communities of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in [[Southern California]].<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/> As a primarily [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]], lifetime career musician, his musical interests were stirred by seeing a parade when he was three to five years old.\n\n{{quote|I still remember the day my dad took me to a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] parade in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]. This marching band from Compton came down the street and the cadence that they were playing almost made me hysterical. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|... the drum section was just smoking ... I was so deeply moved. But I knew at that moment that was what I was going to have to do.<ref name=\"Chicago official history: Chapter XII\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|So from that point on I was always drawn toward drums.<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>|Tris Imboden}}\n\nHis formal training began from grade school; and until there was an available position in the percussion section of the school band, he drummed at home on a [[practice pad]] and studied basic music theory on the trumpet at school.  He ultimately reached the position of second chair trumpeter before switching to the then-available percussion section in junior high school.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/><ref name=\"Tris Imboden, Modern Drummer, Dec 1995\"/> He currently resides in [[Malibu, California]] and on the island of [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], where he is an avid [[surfing|surfer]].<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/>\n\n==Career==\nImboden began his adolescent career in various surf bands, and then achieved professional status in a high school band called The Other Half.  The band performed at venues ranging from sock hops to Hollywood's venerable Teenage Fair, where Imboden said their popularity \"clogged the whole entrance\".<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>{{rp|21}} Out of Newport Harbor High School, Imboden cofounded [[Honk (band)|Honk]] in 1970.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Honk, summary at AllMusic\"/> After recording some [[Demo (music)|demo songs]], the band's first album was the soundtrack for the surf movie ''[[Five Summer Stories]]'',<ref group=\"v\" name=\"Five Summer Stories, DVD at Worldcat\"/> crediting Imboden as composer, producer, drummer, harmonica player, and vocalist.  Imboden established a career trend, ultimately lasting through to Chicago, of occasionally being featured on harmonica.  The song \"Pipeline Sequence\" reached No. 1 on Hawai'i radio.<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/><ref group=\"d\" name=\"Five Summer Stories soundtrack, credits at Allmusic\"/> Being a member of Honk provided Imboden with formative future career experience as the band built their studio recording skills, their touring skills, and innumerable industry contacts.  They worked with bands which would eventually serve as Imboden's future professional base, by touring with [[Loggins and Messina]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[The Beach Boys]]\u2014and by opening [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s concerts.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> Honk went on hiatus from 1976 to 1986, when they established a tradition of periodic reunion concerts in their original home area of [[Southern California]], as band members' schedules permit.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1986, Imboden became a full-time recording and touring member of the Kenny Loggins Band, and then would do part-time work with them until 1989, for a total of 12 years of collaboration.  During his full-time tenure there, he composed and performed the drum set arrangements for popular 1980s motion picture soundtracks: ''[[Caddyshack]]'' and ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/>\n\nFrom the end of his full-time duration with [[Kenny Loggins]] in 1986, until 1989, Imboden's career became a full-time composite of various part-time [[session musician|session]] recordings and live performances with various groups.  His consistent work throughout that entire duration included the following: part-time work with Kenny Loggins; stage support for Grammy Award winning jazz singer, [[Al Jarreau]]; and \"Queen of Funk-Soul\", [[Chaka Khan]].<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/><ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> In 1986, he performed drum set overdub sessions for Neil Diamond's ''Headed for the Future'' album.  This album provided a venue for Imboden's studio session collaboration with a then-member of Chicago, [[Bill Champlin]].<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Headed for the Future, credits at Allmusic\"/> In 1988, he was a studio session player with former member of Chicago, bassist/lead vocalist, [[Peter Cetera]], on Cetera's solo album titled ''One More Story''.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"One More Story, credits at Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1990, his career reshaped by joining the multi-platinum [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].  With the departure of founding drummer [[Danny Seraphine]], Imboden joined the band as the full-time drummer<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> in time for the band's 1991 release titled ''[[Twenty 1]]''.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Twenty 1 personnel credits at Allmusic\"/> As an integral part of Chicago for the latter half of the band's {{age|1967|5|1}}-year<!-- The month and day are unfortunately written arbitrarily, in order to fulfill the requirements of the {{age}} template, until someone finds a more exact date than just the year. --> total career, Imboden would contribute to twelve Chicago records, and to tours alongside [[The Beach Boys]], [[Earth, Wind, & Fire]], and [[The Doobie Brothers]]. Since 2012, his drum set was accompanied by Chicago's newest full-time member, veteran [[auxiliary percussion]]ist [[Walfredo Reyes, Jr.]]<ref name=\"Walfredo Reyes, Jr. at Chicago\"/> On January 17, 2018, Imboden announced his resignation from the band to focus on family time with his new wife and due to the band's schedule of touring intensely for the most of each year.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/tris.imboden/posts/10215424481868357?pnref=story</ref>\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:60 top:15 right:0\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1970 till:08/31/2020\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1970\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1970\n\nColors =\n  id:drumset value:green       legend:Drum_set\n  id:parttimedrum value:yellowgreen       legend:Parttime_Drumset\n  id:percussion  value:orange      legend:Auxiliary_percussion\n  id:drumperc   value:blue        legend:DrumsetAndAux\n  id:audio value:red legend:Audio_album\n  id:video value:purple legend:Video_album\n\nBarData =\n\n  bar:Honk text:Honk\n  bar:Kenny text:Kenny Loggins\n  bar:Chicago text:Chicago\n  bar:Jarreau text:Al Jarreau\n  bar:Chaka text:Chaka Khan\n  bar:Firefall text:Firefall\n  bar:Iain text:Iain Matthews\n  bar:none text:\n\nPlotData=\n\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n\n  bar:Honk from:01/01/1970 till:12/31/1975 color:drumset\n  bar:Iain from:01/01/1976 till:12/31/1977 color:drumset\n  bar:Firefall from:01/01/1981 till:12/31/1982 color:drumset\n  bar:Honk from:01/01/1985 till:end color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Chaka from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Jarreau from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Kenny from:01/01/1977 till:12/31/1985 color:drumset\n  bar:Kenny from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Chicago from:01/01/1990 till:01/17/2018 color:drumset\n  bar:Kenny from:01/17/2018 till:end  color:drumset\n\nLineData=\n\n  at:01/01/1972 color:audio layer:back\n  at:06/01/1972 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1979 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1984 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1986 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1987 color:audio layer:back\n  at:06/01/1987 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1989 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1990 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1991 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1992 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1994 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1995 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1997 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:05/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:09/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1999 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2000 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2002 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:05/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:09/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2007 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/2008 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2011 color:audio layer:back\n\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=5 | Select discography\n|-\n!

As a touring drummer, he has played with Kenny Loggins, [[Al Jarreau]], [[Chaka Khan]], Firefall, [[Cock Robin (band)|Cock Robin]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], Los Lobotomys and other notable groups.\n\nAs a full-time band member, Imboden's career has included Honk, the Kenny Loggins Band (including \"Who's Right, Who's Wrong\" featuring [[Michael Jackson]],<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Keep the Fire, credits at Allmusic\"/> the six-time platinum<ref group=\"d\" name=\"RIAA: gold and platinum: Footloose soundtrack\"/> Number One hit \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\", and \"I'm Alright\" from [[Caddyshack]]), and Chicago.  His career with Chicago has seen the release of thirteen albums, several of them certified as platinum.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialGigList\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nAside from a brief, early, move to Germany, Tris Imboden was born and raised in various beachside communities of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in [[Southern California]].<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/> As a primarily [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]], lifetime career musician, his musical interests were stirred by seeing a parade when he was three to five years old.\n\n{{quote|I still remember the day my dad took me to a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] parade in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]. This marching band from Compton came down the street and the cadence that they were playing almost made me hysterical. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|... the drum section was just smoking ... I was so deeply moved. But I knew at that moment that was what I was going to have to do.<ref name=\"Chicago official history: Chapter XII\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|So from that point on I was always drawn toward drums.<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>|Tris Imboden}}\n\nHis formal training began from grade school; and until there was an available position in the percussion section of the school band, he drummed at home on a [[practice pad]] and studied basic music theory on the trumpet at school.  He ultimately reached the position of second chair trumpeter before switching to the then-available percussion section in junior high school.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/><ref name=\"Tris Imboden, Modern Drummer, Dec 1995\"/> He currently resides in [[Malibu, California]] and on the island of [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], where he is an avid [[surfing|surfer]].<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/>\n\n==Career==\nImboden began his adolescent career in various surf bands, and then achieved professional status in a high school band called The Other Half.  The band performed at venues ranging from sock hops to Hollywood's venerable Teenage Fair, where Imboden said their popularity \"clogged the whole entrance\".<ref name=\"Modern Drummer: Tris Imboden: June 1984\"/>{{rp|21}} Out of Newport Harbor High School, Imboden cofounded [[Honk (band)|Honk]] in 1970.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Honk, summary at AllMusic\"/> After recording some [[Demo (music)|demo songs]], the band's first album was the soundtrack for the surf movie ''[[Five Summer Stories]]'',<ref group=\"v\" name=\"Five Summer Stories, DVD at Worldcat\"/> crediting Imboden as composer, producer, drummer, harmonica player, and vocalist.  Imboden established a career trend, ultimately lasting through to Chicago, of occasionally being featured on harmonica.  The song \"Pipeline Sequence\" reached No. 1 on Hawai'i radio.<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/><ref group=\"d\" name=\"Five Summer Stories soundtrack, credits at Allmusic\"/> Being a member of Honk provided Imboden with formative future career experience as the band built their studio recording skills, their touring skills, and innumerable industry contacts.  They worked with bands which would eventually serve as Imboden's future professional base, by touring with [[Loggins and Messina]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[The Beach Boys]]\u2014and by opening [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s concerts.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> Honk went on hiatus from 1976 to 1986, when they established a tradition of periodic reunion concerts in their original home area of [[Southern California]], as band members' schedules permit.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1986, Imboden became a full-time recording and touring member of the Kenny Loggins Band, and then would do part-time work with them until 1989, for a total of 12 years of collaboration.  During his full-time tenure there, he composed and performed the drum set arrangements for popular 1980s motion picture soundtracks: ''[[Caddyshack]]'' and ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/>\n\nFrom the end of his full-time duration with [[Kenny Loggins]] in 1986, until 1989, Imboden's career became a full-time composite of various part-time [[session musician|session]] recordings and live performances with various groups.  His consistent work throughout that entire duration included the following: part-time work with Kenny Loggins; stage support for Grammy Award winning jazz singer, [[Al Jarreau]]; and \"Queen of Funk-Soul\", [[Chaka Khan]].<ref name=\"Interview W/Tris Imboden, at YouTube\"/><ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> In 1986, he performed drum set overdub sessions for Neil Diamond's ''Headed for the Future'' album.  This album provided a venue for Imboden's studio session collaboration with a then-member of Chicago, [[Bill Champlin]].<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Headed for the Future, credits at Allmusic\"/> In 1988, he was a studio session player with former member of Chicago, bassist/lead vocalist, [[Peter Cetera]], on Cetera's solo album titled ''One More Story''.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"One More Story, credits at Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1990, his career reshaped by joining the multi-platinum [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].  With the departure of founding drummer [[Danny Seraphine]], Imboden joined the band as the full-time drummer<ref name=\"ImbodenOfficialBio\"/> in time for the band's 1991 release titled ''[[Twenty 1]]''.<ref group=\"d\" name=\"Twenty 1 personnel credits at Allmusic\"/> As an integral part of Chicago for the latter half of the band's {{age|1967|5|1}}-year<!-- The month and day are unfortunately written arbitrarily, in order to fulfill the requirements of the {{age}} template, until someone finds a more exact date than just the year. --> total career, Imboden would contribute to twelve Chicago records, and to tours alongside [[The Beach Boys]], [[Earth, Wind, & Fire]], and [[The Doobie Brothers]]. Since 2012, his drum set was accompanied by Chicago's newest full-time member, veteran [[auxiliary percussion]]ist [[Walfredo Reyes, Jr.]]<ref name=\"Walfredo Reyes, Jr. at Chicago\"/> On January 17, 2018, Imboden announced his resignation from the band to focus on family time with his new wife and due to the band's schedule of touring intensely for the most of each year.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/tris.imboden/posts/10215424481868357?pnref=story</ref>\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:60 top:15 right:0\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1970 till:08/31/2020\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1970\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1970\n\nColors =\n  id:drumset value:green       legend:Drum_set\n  id:parttimedrum value:yellowgreen       legend:Parttime_Drumset\n  id:percussion  value:orange      legend:Auxiliary_percussion\n  id:drumperc   value:blue        legend:DrumsetAndAux\n  id:audio value:red legend:Audio_album\n  id:video value:purple legend:Video_album\n\nBarData =\n\n  bar:Honk text:Honk\n  bar:Kenny text:Kenny Loggins\n  bar:Chicago text:Chicago\n  bar:Jarreau text:Al Jarreau\n  bar:Chaka text:Chaka Khan\n  bar:Firefall text:Firefall\n  bar:Iain text:Iain Matthews\n  bar:none text:\n\nPlotData=\n\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n\n  bar:Honk from:01/01/1970 till:12/31/1975 color:drumset\n  bar:Iain from:01/01/1976 till:12/31/1977 color:drumset\n  bar:Firefall from:01/01/1981 till:12/31/1982 color:drumset\n  bar:Honk from:01/01/1985 till:end color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Chaka from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Jarreau from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Kenny from:01/01/1977 till:12/31/1985 color:drumset\n  bar:Kenny from:01/01/1986 till:12/31/1989 color:parttimedrum\n  bar:Chicago from:01/01/1990 till:01/17/2018 color:drumset\n  bar:Kenny from:01/17/2018 till:end  color:drumset\n\nLineData=\n\n  at:01/01/1972 color:audio layer:back\n  at:06/01/1972 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1979 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1984 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1986 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1987 color:audio layer:back\n  at:06/01/1987 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1989 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1990 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1991 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1992 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/1994 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1995 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1997 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:05/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:09/01/1998 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/1999 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2000 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2002 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:05/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:09/01/2003 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2007 color:video layer:back\n  at:01/01/2008 color:audio layer:back\n  at:01/01/2011 color:audio layer:back\n\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=5 | Select discography\n|-\n!

Perhaps the chief use of the inverse gamma distribution is in [[Bayesian statistics]], where the distribution arises as the marginal posterior distribution for the unknown [[variance]] of a [[normal distribution]], if an [[uninformative prior]] is used, and as an analytically tractable [[conjugate prior]], if an informative prior is required.(Hoff, 2009:74)\n\nHowever, it is common among Bayesians to consider an alternative [[Statistical parameter|parametrization]] of the [[normal distribution]] in terms of the [[precision (statistics)|precision]], defined as the reciprocal of the variance, which allows the gamma distribution to be used directly as a conjugate prior.  Other Bayesians prefer to parametrize the inverse gamma distribution differently, as a [[scaled inverse chi-squared distribution]].\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Probability density function===\nThe inverse gamma distribution's [[probability density function]] is defined over the [[support (mathematics)|support]] <math>x > 0</math>\n\n:<math>\nf(x; \\alpha, \\beta)\n= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\n(1/x)^{\\alpha + 1}\\exp\\left(-\\beta/x\\right)\n</math>\n\nwith [[shape parameter]] <math>\\alpha</math> and <!-- see the definition of scale for distributions!!! --> [[scale parameter]] <math>\\beta</math>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InverseGammaDistribution.html|title=InverseGammaDistribution\u2014Wolfram Language Documentation|author=|date=|website=reference.wolfram.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>  Here <math>\\Gamma(\\cdot)</math> denotes the [[gamma function]].\n\nUnlike the [[Gamma distribution]], which contains a somewhat similar exponential term, <math>\\beta</math> is a scale parameter as the distribution function satisfies:\n:<math> \nf(x; \\alpha, \\beta) \n= \\frac{f(x / \\beta; \\alpha, 1)}{\\beta}\n</math>\n\n===Cumulative distribution function===\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] is the [[Incomplete gamma function#Regularized Gamma functions and Poisson random variables|regularized gamma function]]\n\n:<math>F(x; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\alpha,\\frac{\\beta}{x}\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} = Q\\left(\\alpha, \\frac{\\beta}{x}\\right)\\!</math>\n\nwhere the numerator is the upper [[incomplete gamma function]] and the denominator is the [[gamma function]].

Perhaps the chief use of the inverse gamma distribution is in [[Bayesian statistics]], where the distribution arises as the marginal posterior distribution for the unknown [[variance]] of a [[normal distribution]], if an [[uninformative prior]] is used, and as an analytically tractable [[conjugate prior]], if an informative prior is required.(Hoff, 2009:74)\n\nHowever, it is common among Bayesians to consider an alternative [[Statistical parameter|parametrization]] of the [[normal distribution]] in terms of the [[precision (statistics)|precision]], defined as the reciprocal of the variance, which allows the gamma distribution to be used directly as a conjugate prior.  Other Bayesians prefer to parametrize the inverse gamma distribution differently, as a [[scaled inverse chi-squared distribution]].\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Probability density function===\nThe inverse gamma distribution's [[probability density function]] is defined over the [[support (mathematics)|support]] <math>x > 0</math>\n\n:<math>\nf(x; \\alpha, \\beta)\n= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\n(1/x)^{\\alpha + 1}\\exp\\left(-\\beta/x\\right)\n</math>\n\nwith [[shape parameter]] <math>\\alpha</math> and <!-- see the definition of scale for distributions!!! --> [[scale parameter]] <math>\\beta</math>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InverseGammaDistribution.html|title=InverseGammaDistribution\u2014Wolfram Language Documentation|author=|date=|website=reference.wolfram.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>  Here <math>\\Gamma(\\cdot)</math> denotes the [[gamma function]].\n\nUnlike the [[Gamma distribution]], which contains a somewhat similar exponential term, <math>\\beta</math> is a scale parameter as the distribution function satisfies:\n:<math> \nf(x; \\alpha, \\beta) \n= \\frac{f(x / \\beta; \\alpha, 1)}{\\beta}\n</math>\n\n===Cumulative distribution function===\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] is the [[Incomplete gamma function#Regularized Gamma functions and Poisson random variables|regularized gamma function]]\n\n:<math>F(x; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\alpha,\\frac{\\beta}{x}\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} = Q\\left(\\alpha, \\frac{\\beta}{x}\\right)\\!</math>\n\nwhere the numerator is the upper [[incomplete gamma function]] and the denominator is the [[gamma function]].

Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job. Whether the end result is art, is unknown [to him]'.<ref name=\"Interview for Inkscape Magazine\">>{{cite web | url=https://sreysarkar.weebly.com/| title= Interview for Inkscape Magazine| work=

The Society of Advocates was never formally wound up, but its building was sold off in 1865 and the last advocate died in 1912.\n\nBarristers were admitted to the [[Court of Arches]] of the [[Church of England]] in 1867. More recently, [[Solicitor Advocate]]s have also been allowed to play this role.\n\n===Isle of Man===\nAdvocates are the only lawyers with rights of audience in the courts of the [[Isle of Man]].  An advocate's role is to advise on all matters of law: it may involve representing a client in the civil and criminal courts or advising a client on matters such as matrimonial and family law, trusts and estates, regulatory matters, property transactions, and commercial and business law.  In court, advocates wear a horsehair wig, stiff collar, bands, and a gown in the same way as barristers do elsewhere.\n\nTo become an advocate, it is normally necessary to hold either a [[Legal education in the United Kingdom#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|qualifying law degree]] with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors, or else a degree in another subject with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors complemented by the [[Common Professional Examination]].  It is then necessary to obtain a legal professional qualification such as the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or the [[Legal Practice Course]].  It is not, however, necessary actually to be admitted as an English [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]] to train as an advocate.\n\nTrainee advocates (as [[articled clerk]]s are now more usually known) normally undertake a period of two years\u2019 training articled to a senior advocate; in the case of English barristers or solicitors who have been practicing or admitted for three years this training, the period is reduced to one year.  Foreign lawyers who have been registered as legal practitioners in the Isle of Man for a certain time may also undertake a shorter period of training and supervision.  During their training, all trainee advocates are required to pass the Isle of Man bar examinations, which include papers on civil and criminal practice, constitutional and land law, and company law and taxation, as well as accounts.  The examinations are rigorous and candidates are limited to three attempts to pass each paper.\n\nSenior English barristers are occasionally licensed to appear as advocates in cases expected to be unusually long or complex, without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act in relation to the matter for which they have been licensed.  Similarly, barristers and solicitors employed as public prosecutors may be licensed to appear as advocates without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act as such only for the duration of that employment.\n\nThe professional conduct of advocates is regulated by the [[Isle of Man Law Society]], which also maintains a library for its members in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].  While advocates in the Isle of Man have not traditionally prefixed their names with 'Advocate' in the Channel Islands manner, some advocates have now started to adopt this practice.\n\n===Scotland{{anchor|Advocate (Scotland)}}===\n\n====Faculty of Advocates====\n[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century advocate.]]\n{{Scots law}}\n{{main|Faculty of Advocates}}\n\t\nAdvocates are regulated by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The Faculty of Advocates has about 750 members, of whom about 460 are in private practice. About 75 are [[Queen's Counsel]]. The Faculty is headed by the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty who, along with the Vice-Dean, [[Treasurer]], [[court clerk|Clerk]] are elected annually by [[secret ballot]].\n\t \nThe Faculty has a service company, Faculty Services Ltd, to which almost all advocates belong, which organized the stables and fee collection. This gives a guarantee to all newly called advocates of a place. Until the end of 2007, there was an agreement with the [[Law Society of Scotland]], which is the professional body for Scottish [[solicitor]]s, as to the payment of fees, but this has now been replaced by the Law Society. It remains the case that advocates are not permitted to [[lawsuit|sue]] for their fees, as they have no contractual relationship with their instructing solicitor or with the client.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/husbands-final.rtf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010141208/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/husbands-final.rtf |archivedate=2007-10-10 }}</ref> Their fees are [[honorarium|honoraria]].\n\nAdvocates wear wigs, white bow-ties (or falls in the case of senior counsel), straps and gowns as a dress in court.\n\n====Becoming an advocate====\nThe process of becoming an advocate is referred to as ''[[devilling]]''.  All Intrants will be Scottish solicitors, i.e. hold a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree and the [[Diploma in Legal Practice]], and must have completed the traineeships of two years (which in some cases may be reduced to eighteen months) required to qualify as a solicitor; or else will be members of the [[Bar association|Bar]] in another [[common law]] jurisdiction.\n\n=====Admission to the Faculty of Advocates=====\n\nAt the end of the devilling period, a devil's admission to the Faculty is dependent on certification by the principal devil master that the devil is a fit and proper person to be an advocate and that the devil has been involved in a wide range of work in the course of devilling. A devil's competence in a number of aspects of written and oral advocacy is assessed during devilling, and if a devil is assessed as not competent, he or she will not be admitted to the Faculty. Further details of this process can be found in the assessment section.\n\n=====Recent developments=====\n\nIn recent years, increasing numbers of advocates have come to the Scottish Bar after some time as solicitors, but it is possible to qualify with a law degree, after twenty-one months traineeship in a solicitor's office and almost a year as a 'devil', or apprentice advocate. There are exceptions for lawyers who are qualified in other European jurisdictions, but all must take the training course as 'devils'.\n\nUntil 2007, a number of young European lawyers were given a placement with advocates under the [[European Young Lawyers Scheme]] organized by the [[British Council]]. They are known as 'Eurodevils', in distinction to the Scottish 'devils'. This scheme was withdrawn by the British Council. In January 2009, a replacement scheme began.\n\nLawyers qualified in other European Union states (but not in England and Wales) may have limited rights of audience in the Scottish supreme courts if they appear with an advocate, and a few solicitors known as 'solicitor-advocates' have rights of audience, but for practical purposes, advocates have almost exclusive rights of audience in the supreme courts \u2013 the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (criminal), and the [[Court of Session]] (civil). Advocates share the right of audience with solicitors in the [[sheriff court]]s and [[justice of the peace court]]s.\n\nIt used to be the case that advocates were completely immune from suit etc. while conducting court cases and pre-trial work, as they had to act 'fearlessly and independently'; the rehearing of actions was considered contrary to [[public interest]]; and advocates are ''required'' to accept clients, they cannot pick and choose. However, the seven-judge English ruling of ''Arthur J.S. Hall & Co. (a firm) v.

In both jurisdictions, advocates\u2014properly called Advocates of the Royal Court\u2014are the only lawyers with general rights of audience in their courts.\n\nTo be eligible to practice as an advocate in Jersey, it is necessary first to have a law degree from a British university or a [[graduate diploma in law]] and to have qualified as a recognized legal professional in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.<ref>Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997</ref> Thereafter, a candidate must undertake two years of practical experience in a law office dealing with Jersey law, enroll on the Jersey Law Course provided by the Institute of Law, Jersey<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ |title=Home &#124; Institute of Law |publisher=Lawinstitute.ac.je |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811152018/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ |archivedate=2013-08-11 }}</ref> and pass examinations in six subjects. Alternatively, a person may apply to become a Jersey advocate two years after qualifying as a Jersey solicitor.\n\nTo become an advocate in Guernsey, one has to possess a valid law degree or diploma, plus a qualification as an English [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]], or a French [[avocat]]. They must then study for the Guernsey Bar. Three months of study of [[Normans|Norman]] law at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Caen]] (University of Caen) is required; this is no longer required for entry into the legal profession in Jersey.\n\nGuernsey advocates dress in the same way as barristers, but substitute a black [[biretta]]-like [[Toque (French)|toque]] for a wig, while those in Jersey go bare-headed.  Advocates are entitled to prefix their names with 'Advocate'; e.g. Mr. Tostevin is called to the Guernsey Bar and is henceforth known as Advocate Tostevin.\n\nThe head of the profession of advocate in each bailiwick is called the [[B\u00e2tonnier]].\n\n== Nordic countries ==\n{{main|Advokat}}\n\nThe [[Nordic countries]] have a united legal profession, which means that they do not draw a distinction between lawyers who plead in court and those who do not. To get an official recognition with an advocates title, the candidate must have a legal degree, that is, completed ca. 5\u20136 years of legal studies from an accredited university in his or own country, and in addition have worked for some time (around 2 \u2013 5 years) under the auspices of a qualified advocate and have some experience from court. When qualified, the candidate may obtain a license as an ''advocate'', the equivalent of being called to the bar. In all the [[Scandinavian languages]] the title is ''[[advokat]]''; in Finland ''advokat'' is the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] title for such a qualified lawyer, with the equivalent title in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] being ''asianajaja''.\n\nHowever, one does not necessarily have to be an advocate to represent a party in the Nordic countries legally. In Norway, a person with an appropriate law degree, for example, can practice law as a registered legal advisor (''rettshjelper'') instead, which gives many of the same rights as an advocate's title. Both in Sweden and Norway any adult, in theory, can represent a party in court without any prior approval, training, license or advocate title. In practice it's unusual, and in Norway, it's subject to the approval of the court, which is unlikely to give it except in very simple cases.\n\nIn English, the Scandinavian title of ''advokat'' is interchangeably also translated as [[barrister]], [[lawyer]] or [[attorney-at-law]].\n\n==South Africa==\nIn [[South Africa]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=sabar.co.za |publisher=sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603014800/http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |archivedate=2013-06-03 }}</ref> there are two main branches of legal practitioner: attorneys, who do legal work of all kinds, and advocates, who are specialist litigators; see [[Attorneys in South Africa]].  In general, advocates (also called 'counsel') are 'briefed' by attorneys when a specialist skill in court-based [[litigation]], or in research into the law is required;  advocates have no direct contact with clients and are said to be in a 'referral' profession.\n\nThe key formal distinction, however, is the different rights with regard to the courts in which they may appear. Advocates have the right to appear in any court, while attorneys have the right to appear only in the [[South African Law#Court system in South Africa|lower courts]]. (And, under certain conditions, can acquire the right of appearance in the [[South African Law#Court system in South Africa|superior courts]], by applying to the registrar of the provincial division of the relevant High Court.)<ref>[http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf \"LAW PROFESSIONALS\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728233206/http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |date=2013-07-28 }}, Department of Labour South Africa</ref> A further distinction is that while attorneys practice in partnership, advocates are individual practitioners and never form partnerships; practice in \"Chambers\" and  / or  \"Groups\" is standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johannesburgbar.co.za/groups.html |title=johannesburgbar.co.za |publisher=johannesburgbar.co.za |date=2001-04-08 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513091027/http://www.johannesburgbar.co.za/groups.html |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to hold the [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LL.B.]] degree, and to become a member of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination.  See [[Legal education in South Africa]].\n\nOn the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate \"of proven experience and skill\" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the [[President of South Africa]] as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a \"silk\").  When a junior advocate is viewed in the eyes of any particular Senior Counsel (Silk) as having commended him or herself in the profession so as to warrant recognition for excellence, he or she is commonly rewarded with a traditional gift of a [[Brief (law)#Brief bag|red brief bag]].\n\n''State advocates'' act as a [[Prosecutor#Directors of Public Prosecutions|public prosecutor]] in High Court matters, typically in cases requiring preparation and research. They are appointed by the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] and are attached to the Office of the [[National Prosecuting Authority#Leadership|National Director of Public Prosecutions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/brochure/careers-in-justice.html|title=Justice/Resources/Publications/Careers in the Justice System|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230184022/http://www.justice.gov.za/brochure/careers-in-justice.html|archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Pakistan==\nDifferent levels of '''Advocate''' exist in [[Pakistan]]:\n\n===Advocate===\nThe first level is the Advocate, who is eligible to practice in the [[district court]]s or lower courts in the respective province. One can qualify as an Advocate after completion of a law degree (LL.B of three years), six months [[pupillage]] under a senior Advocate in his/her chambers and thereafter to go for Bar admission test, the Bar Council of the relevant province examine him/her that he is fit or not to become as an Advocate and is not convicted. After passing the multiple-choice question examination and interview conducted by the provincial Bar Council, the Bar Council will issue him/her the license for appearing before the Courts.\n\n===Advocate High Court===\nAfter completion of two years, practice Advocates then can apply for Advocate High court practicing certificate/ license and after an interview, they can apply for Advocate High Court license.\n\n===Advocate Supreme Court===\nAdvocate Supreme Court is the third level. After successful completion of ten years of practice in the High Courts by the applicant, the panel of members of [[Pakistan Bar Council]] and one judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, review the application. (Before 1985 the requirement was successful completion of five years practice in the High Courts of Pakistan.) Over fifty percent of applications are accepted, after successful completion of the requirement. An unsuccessful application in one year does not bar the candidate from re-applying in the next judicial year.\n\nThe highest level is the Senior Advocate Supreme Court. It is Pakistan's title equivalent to [[Queen's Counsel]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nAfter at least fifteen years of practice, by invitation or by an application to a panel of Supreme Court Judges headed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan, one can become Senior Advocate of Supreme Court of Pakistan. Very few applications are accepted and even fewer invitations are made. [[Attorney General of Pakistan|Attorneys General]] are usually invited by the Supreme Court on the appointment, to the office. So are some notable High Court judges who upon retirement choose to practice before the Supreme Court, where they are still eligible to do so.\n\n==India==\n[[File:Advocate (5581476838).jpg|thumb|right|Advocate's office in Rajasthan]]\n\nIn [[Law of India|India]], the law relating to the Advocates is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by [[Ashok Kumar Sen]], the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the [[Bar Council of India]]. Under the Act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.\n\nEach State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Advocates willing to practice predominantly within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practice in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Advocate from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.\n\nThe advantage of having the State Bar Councils is that the workload of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any Advocate individually, as so provided under the Advocates Act, 1961.\n\nThe process of being entitled to practice in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India (or from one of the four recognized Universities in the [[United Kingdom]]) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner, the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practicing in India is met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practice before courts of India.\n\nEnrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as an Advocate and is required to maintain a standard of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes \"Rules of Conduct\" to be observed by the Advocates in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.\n\nAll Advocates in India are at the same level and are recognized as such. Any distinction, if any, is made only on the basis of seniority, which implies the length of practice at the Bar. As a recognition of law practice and specialization in an area of law, there is a concept of conferral of Senior Advocate status. An Advocate may be recognized by the Judges of the High Court (in case of an Advocate practicing before that High Court) or by the Supreme Court (in case of the Advocate practicing before the Supreme Court). While the conferral of Senior Advocate status not only implies distinction and fame of the Advocate, it also requires the Senior Advocate to follow higher standards of conduct and some distinct rules. Also, a Senior Advocate is not allowed to interact directly with the clients. He can only take briefs from other Advocates and argue on the basis of the details given by them. From the year 2010 onward a mandatory rule is made for lawyers passing out from the year 2009-10 to sit for an evaluation test named AIBE (All India Bar Exam) for one to qualify as an advocate and practice in the courts. However, to practice law before the Supreme Court of India, Advocates must first appear for and qualify in the Supreme Court Advocate on Record Examination conducted by the Supreme Court.\n\nFurther, under the Constitutional structure, there is a provision for the elevation of Advocates as judges of High Courts and Supreme Court. The only requirement is the Advocate must have ten years standing before the High Court(/s) or before the Supreme Court to be eligible for such. (Article 217 and 124 of the Constitution of India for High Courts and Supreme Court respectively)\n\n==Bangladesh==\nIn Bangladesh, after passing the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]], one can apply for admission for studying Law in Universities. There are several [[Universities in Bangladesh|public and private universities]] which provide [[Bachelor of Laws]] and [[Master of Laws]] degree in Bangladesh. Generally, the LL.B. course is equivalent to a four-year bachelor's degree. Graduate lawyers have to seat for and pass the Bar Council Exam to become advocates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Students lock Bar Council|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/09/04/students-lock-bar-council|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=[[bdnews24.com]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183720/http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/09/04/students-lock-bar-council|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Advocate of Supreme Court===\nBy passing the [[Bangladesh Bar Council]] Exam, advocates are eligible to practice in the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] and other courts. A license is obtained after successful completion of two year's practice in the lower courts by applicant, which is reviewed by a body of the relevant provincial Bar Council. Most applications after successful completion of the requirement, are accepted.\n\n==Sri Lanka==\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] (formally Ceylon) till 1973 Advocate was a practitioner in a [[court|court of law]] who is legally qualified to [[Prosecutor|prosecute]] and defend actions in such court on the [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] of clients. Advocates had to pass the HSC exam and enter the [[Ceylon Law College]] and follow the advocates course and sit for the relevant exams. Thereafter, they would have to practice under a senior advocate before being [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] for admission as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. Members of the English, Scottish and Irish Bars are permitted to be admitted to an Barrister without examination on payment of a fee. Ceylonese Advocates with three years standing were allowed to be called to the English Bar without examination on completing three terms. The ''Justice Law No. 44 of 1973'' of the [[National State Assembly]] created a single group of practitioners known as [[Attorneys in Sri Lanka|Attorneys-at-law]]. The current equivalent to an advocate is a [[counsel]] who is a trial lawyer distinguished from an instructing attorney.\n\n==Brazil==\nIn [[Brazil]], the [[bar examination]] occurs nationally in March, August, and December. These examinations are unified and organized by the [[Order of Attorneys of Brazil]]. After 5 years in [[law school]], Brazilian law students are required to take the bar exam, which consists of 2 phases: the [[multiple choice]] test and written test, without any further requirements.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil]] applies restrictions on professional practice of law in the fulfillment of the [[requirement]]s, which may include in addition to [[graduation]], formal submission of the [[applicant]] in the proficiency [[Performance test (assessment)|tests]]. The Order exam is tied to Law No. 8609 of 4/7/1994:\n\n\"'''Article 8''': For registration as an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] is needed: IV - \"To pass the Examination of the Order;\"\n\nWithin its powers expressly granted by the Constitution, the [[ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] [[legislator|legislative]] demands that whoever wishes to pursue the [[legal]] [[profession]] possess the [[academic degree|degree]] of [[Bachelor of Law]] and approval of Examination of Order, whose preparation and implementation is done by their own class. The Constitution itself provides for the restriction, and the [[Statute]] of [[Law]] requires the examination.\n\nThe bar exam in Brazil approves very few students and is considered a hard exam.  For instance, in February 2014, the Bar association made a release stating that only 19.64% of students had been approved in the last exam and were able to register as a lawyer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oab.org.br/noticia/26632/com-novidades-oab-divulga-resultado-do-xi-exame-de-ordem-unificado |title=OAB releases the results of the XI Unified Bar Exam (in Portuguese) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014-02-03 |website=Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil |publisher=OAB |accessdate=2015-01-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409105839/http://www.oab.org.br/noticia/26632/com-novidades-oab-divulga-resultado-do-xi-exame-de-ordem-unificado |archivedate=2014-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Netherlands==\n\nIn Dutch law, the law relating to the Advocates is the Advocates Act. Under the Act, the Dutch bar association (Orde van Advocaten) regulates the professional conduct and the professional education of the advocates.\n\nA Dutch advocate has to complete Dutch bar education and fulfill certain requirements (which may vary among the various judicial regions within the Netherlands) under the supervision of a senior advocate for a period of at least three years, called the 'advocate-stage'. After completing the bar education exams, the junior advocate is admitted unconditionally to the Dutch bar.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Advocatus]]\n* [[Barrister]]\n* [[Lawspeaker]]\n* [[Jurist]]\n* [[Ombudsman]]\n* [[Solicitor]]\n* [[Solicitor-Advocate]]\n* [[Advocate General]]\n* [[Judge Advocate General]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180723223847/http://www.learningthelaw.in/2017/02/roles-and-responsibilities-of-advocate.html Roles and responsibilities of an Advocate in the Court of Law]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|advocate}}\n{{Commons category|Advocates}}\n*[http://www.advocates.org.uk The Faculty of Advocates official website]\n*[http://www.alaki.fi Association of licensed attorneys in Finland]\n\n[[Category:Legal professions]]\n[[Category:Scots law general titles]]\n[[Category:Solicitors]]\n[[Category:Advocates| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the modern legal profession|other uses|The Advocate (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Profession}}\n{{Infobox Occupation\n| name= Advocate\n| image= Honor\u00e9 Daumier 018.jpg\n| caption= 19th-century painting of advocates, by French artist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]\n| official_names= [[Barrister]] <br/> [[Magistrate]]\n<!------------Details------------------->\n| activity_sector= [[Law]]\n| competencies= Good memory, advocacy and interpersonal skills, analytical mind, critical thinking, commercial sense\n| formation= \n| employment_field= [[Court]] \n| related_occupation= [[Barrister]], [[Judge]], [[Jurist]]\n}}\nAn '''advocate''' is a professional  in the field of law.

The Society of Advocates was never formally wound up, but its building was sold off in 1865 and the last advocate died in 1912.\n\nBarristers were admitted to the [[Court of Arches]] of the [[Church of England]] in 1867. More recently, [[Solicitor Advocate]]s have also been allowed to play this role.\n\n===Isle of Man===\nAdvocates are the only lawyers with rights of audience in the courts of the [[Isle of Man]].  An advocate's role is to advise on all matters of law: it may involve representing a client in the civil and criminal courts or advising a client on matters such as matrimonial and family law, trusts and estates, regulatory matters, property transactions, and commercial and business law.  In court, advocates wear a horsehair wig, stiff collar, bands, and a gown in the same way as barristers do elsewhere.\n\nTo become an advocate, it is normally necessary to hold either a [[Legal education in the United Kingdom#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|qualifying law degree]] with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors, or else a degree in another subject with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors complemented by the [[Common Professional Examination]].  It is then necessary to obtain a legal professional qualification such as the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or the [[Legal Practice Course]].  It is not, however, necessary actually to be admitted as an English [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]] to train as an advocate.\n\nTrainee advocates (as [[articled clerk]]s are now more usually known) normally undertake a period of two years\u2019 training articled to a senior advocate; in the case of English barristers or solicitors who have been practicing or admitted for three years this training, the period is reduced to one year.  Foreign lawyers who have been registered as legal practitioners in the Isle of Man for a certain time may also undertake a shorter period of training and supervision.  During their training, all trainee advocates are required to pass the Isle of Man bar examinations, which include papers on civil and criminal practice, constitutional and land law, and company law and taxation, as well as accounts.  The examinations are rigorous and candidates are limited to three attempts to pass each paper.\n\nSenior English barristers are occasionally licensed to appear as advocates in cases expected to be unusually long or complex, without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act in relation to the matter for which they have been licensed.  Similarly, barristers and solicitors employed as public prosecutors may be licensed to appear as advocates without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act as such only for the duration of that employment.\n\nThe professional conduct of advocates is regulated by the [[Isle of Man Law Society]], which also maintains a library for its members in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].  While advocates in the Isle of Man have not traditionally prefixed their names with 'Advocate' in the Channel Islands manner, some advocates have now started to adopt this practice.\n\n===Scotland{{anchor|Advocate (Scotland)}}===\n\n====Faculty of Advocates====\n[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century advocate.]]\n{{Scots law}}\n{{main|Faculty of Advocates}}\n\t\nAdvocates are regulated by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The Faculty of Advocates has about 750 members, of whom about 460 are in private practice. About 75 are [[Queen's Counsel]]. The Faculty is headed by the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty who, along with the Vice-Dean, [[Treasurer]], [[court clerk|Clerk]] are elected annually by [[secret ballot]].\n\t \nThe Faculty has a service company, Faculty Services Ltd, to which almost all advocates belong, which organized the stables and fee collection. This gives a guarantee to all newly called advocates of a place. Until the end of 2007, there was an agreement with the [[Law Society of Scotland]], which is the professional body for Scottish [[solicitor]]s, as to the payment of fees, but this has now been replaced by the Law Society. It remains the case that advocates are not permitted to [[lawsuit|sue]] for their fees, as they have no contractual relationship with their instructing solicitor or with the client.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/husbands-final.rtf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010141208/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/husbands-final.rtf |archivedate=2007-10-10 }}</ref> Their fees are [[honorarium|honoraria]].\n\nAdvocates wear wigs, white bow-ties (or falls in the case of senior counsel), straps and gowns as a dress in court.\n\n====Becoming an advocate====\nThe process of becoming an advocate is referred to as ''[[devilling]]''.  All Intrants will be Scottish solicitors, i.e. hold a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree and the [[Diploma in Legal Practice]], and must have completed the traineeships of two years (which in some cases may be reduced to eighteen months) required to qualify as a solicitor; or else will be members of the [[Bar association|Bar]] in another [[common law]] jurisdiction.\n\n=====Admission to the Faculty of Advocates=====\n\nAt the end of the devilling period, a devil's admission to the Faculty is dependent on certification by the principal devil master that the devil is a fit and proper person to be an advocate and that the devil has been involved in a wide range of work in the course of devilling. A devil's competence in a number of aspects of written and oral advocacy is assessed during devilling, and if a devil is assessed as not competent, he or she will not be admitted to the Faculty. Further details of this process can be found in the assessment section.\n\n=====Recent developments=====\n\nIn recent years, increasing numbers of advocates have come to the Scottish Bar after some time as solicitors, but it is possible to qualify with a law degree, after twenty-one months traineeship in a solicitor's office and almost a year as a 'devil', or apprentice advocate. There are exceptions for lawyers who are qualified in other European jurisdictions, but all must take the training course as 'devils'.\n\nUntil 2007, a number of young European lawyers were given a placement with advocates under the [[European Young Lawyers Scheme]] organized by the [[British Council]]. They are known as 'Eurodevils', in distinction to the Scottish 'devils'. This scheme was withdrawn by the British Council. In January 2009, a replacement scheme began.\n\nLawyers qualified in other European Union states (but not in England and Wales) may have limited rights of audience in the Scottish supreme courts if they appear with an advocate, and a few solicitors known as 'solicitor-advocates' have rights of audience, but for practical purposes, advocates have almost exclusive rights of audience in the supreme courts \u2013 the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (criminal), and the [[Court of Session]] (civil). Advocates share the right of audience with solicitors in the [[sheriff court]]s and [[justice of the peace court]]s.\n\nIt used to be the case that advocates were completely immune from suit etc. while conducting court cases and pre-trial work, as they had to act 'fearlessly and independently'; the rehearing of actions was considered contrary to [[public interest]]; and advocates are ''required'' to accept clients, they cannot pick and choose. However, the seven-judge English ruling of ''Arthur J.S. Hall & Co. (a firm) v. Simons'' 2000 (House of Lords)<ref>{{cite web|author=Law Lord's Department |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000720/hall-1.htm |title=House of Lords - Arthur J.S Hall and Co. v.

In both jurisdictions, advocates\u2014properly called Advocates of the Royal Court\u2014are the only lawyers with general rights of audience in their courts.\n\nTo be eligible to practice as an advocate in Jersey, it is necessary first to have a law degree from a British university or a [[graduate diploma in law]] and to have qualified as a recognized legal professional in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.<ref>Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997</ref> Thereafter, a candidate must undertake two years of practical experience in a law office dealing with Jersey law, enroll on the Jersey Law Course provided by the Institute of Law, Jersey<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ |title=Home &#124; Institute of Law |publisher=Lawinstitute.ac.je |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811152018/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ |archivedate=2013-08-11 }}</ref> and pass examinations in six subjects. Alternatively, a person may apply to become a Jersey advocate two years after qualifying as a Jersey solicitor.\n\nTo become an advocate in Guernsey, one has to possess a valid law degree or diploma, plus a qualification as an English [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]], or a French [[avocat]]. They must then study for the Guernsey Bar. Three months of study of [[Normans|Norman]] law at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Caen]] (University of Caen) is required; this is no longer required for entry into the legal profession in Jersey.\n\nGuernsey advocates dress in the same way as barristers, but substitute a black [[biretta]]-like [[Toque (French)|toque]] for a wig, while those in Jersey go bare-headed.  Advocates are entitled to prefix their names with 'Advocate'; e.g. Mr. Tostevin is called to the Guernsey Bar and is henceforth known as Advocate Tostevin.\n\nThe head of the profession of advocate in each bailiwick is called the [[B\u00e2tonnier]].\n\n== Nordic countries ==\n{{main|Advokat}}\n\nThe [[Nordic countries]] have a united legal profession, which means that they do not draw a distinction between lawyers who plead in court and those who do not. To get an official recognition with an advocates title, the candidate must have a legal degree, that is, completed ca. 5\u20136 years of legal studies from an accredited university in his or own country, and in addition have worked for some time (around 2 \u2013 5 years) under the auspices of a qualified advocate and have some experience from court. When qualified, the candidate may obtain a license as an ''advocate'', the equivalent of being called to the bar. In all the [[Scandinavian languages]] the title is ''[[advokat]]''; in Finland ''advokat'' is the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] title for such a qualified lawyer, with the equivalent title in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] being ''asianajaja''.\n\nHowever, one does not necessarily have to be an advocate to represent a party in the Nordic countries legally. In Norway, a person with an appropriate law degree, for example, can practice law as a registered legal advisor (''rettshjelper'') instead, which gives many of the same rights as an advocate's title. Both in Sweden and Norway any adult, in theory, can represent a party in court without any prior approval, training, license or advocate title. In practice it's unusual, and in Norway, it's subject to the approval of the court, which is unlikely to give it except in very simple cases.\n\nIn English, the Scandinavian title of ''advokat'' is interchangeably also translated as [[barrister]], [[lawyer]] or [[attorney-at-law]].\n\n==South Africa==\nIn [[South Africa]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=sabar.co.za |publisher=sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603014800/http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |archivedate=2013-06-03 }}</ref> there are two main branches of legal practitioner: attorneys, who do legal work of all kinds, and advocates, who are specialist litigators; see [[Attorneys in South Africa]].  In general, advocates (also called 'counsel') are 'briefed' by attorneys when a specialist skill in court-based [[litigation]], or in research into the law is required;  advocates have no direct contact with clients and are said to be in a 'referral' profession.\n\nThe key formal distinction, however, is the different rights with regard to the courts in which they may appear. Advocates have the right to appear in any court, while attorneys have the right to appear only in the [[South African Law#Court system in South Africa|lower courts]]. (And, under certain conditions, can acquire the right of appearance in the [[South African Law#Court system in South Africa|superior courts]], by applying to the registrar of the provincial division of the relevant High Court.)<ref>[http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf \"LAW PROFESSIONALS\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728233206/http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |date=2013-07-28 }}, Department of Labour South Africa</ref> A further distinction is that while attorneys practice in partnership, advocates are individual practitioners and never form partnerships; practice in \"Chambers\" and  / or  \"Groups\" is standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johannesburgbar.co.za/groups.html |title=johannesburgbar.co.za |publisher=johannesburgbar.co.za |date=2001-04-08 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513091027/http://www.johannesburgbar.co.za/groups.html |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to hold the [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LL.B.]] degree, and to become a member of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination.  See [[Legal education in South Africa]].\n\nOn the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate \"of proven experience and skill\" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the [[President of South Africa]] as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a \"silk\").  When a junior advocate is viewed in the eyes of any particular Senior Counsel (Silk) as having commended him or herself in the profession so as to warrant recognition for excellence, he or she is commonly rewarded with a traditional gift of a [[Brief (law)#Brief bag|red brief bag]].\n\n''State advocates'' act as a [[Prosecutor#Directors of Public Prosecutions|public prosecutor]] in High Court matters, typically in cases requiring preparation and research. They are appointed by the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] and are attached to the Office of the [[National Prosecuting Authority#Leadership|National Director of Public Prosecutions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/brochure/careers-in-justice.html|title=Justice/Resources/Publications/Careers in the Justice System|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230184022/http://www.justice.gov.za/brochure/careers-in-justice.html|archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Pakistan==\nDifferent levels of '''Advocate''' exist in [[Pakistan]]:\n\n===Advocate===\nThe first level is the Advocate, who is eligible to practice in the [[district court]]s or lower courts in the respective province. One can qualify as an Advocate after completion of a law degree (LL.B of three years), six months [[pupillage]] under a senior Advocate in his/her chambers and thereafter to go for Bar admission test, the Bar Council of the relevant province examine him/her that he is fit or not to become as an Advocate and is not convicted. After passing the multiple-choice question examination and interview conducted by the provincial Bar Council, the Bar Council will issue him/her the license for appearing before the Courts.\n\n===Advocate High Court===\nAfter completion of two years, practice Advocates then can apply for Advocate High court practicing certificate/ license and after an interview, they can apply for Advocate High Court license.\n\n===Advocate Supreme Court===\nAdvocate Supreme Court is the third level. After successful completion of ten years of practice in the High Courts by the applicant, the panel of members of [[Pakistan Bar Council]] and one judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, review the application. (Before 1985 the requirement was successful completion of five years practice in the High Courts of Pakistan.) Over fifty percent of applications are accepted, after successful completion of the requirement. An unsuccessful application in one year does not bar the candidate from re-applying in the next judicial year.\n\nThe highest level is the Senior Advocate Supreme Court. It is Pakistan's title equivalent to [[Queen's Counsel]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nAfter at least fifteen years of practice, by invitation or by an application to a panel of Supreme Court Judges headed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan, one can become Senior Advocate of Supreme Court of Pakistan. Very few applications are accepted and even fewer invitations are made. [[Attorney General of Pakistan|Attorneys General]] are usually invited by the Supreme Court on the appointment, to the office. So are some notable High Court judges who upon retirement choose to practice before the Supreme Court, where they are still eligible to do so.\n\n==India==\n[[File:Advocate (5581476838).jpg|thumb|right|Advocate's office in Rajasthan]]\n\nIn [[Law of India|India]], the law relating to the Advocates is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by [[Ashok Kumar Sen]], the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the [[Bar Council of India]]. Under the Act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.\n\nEach State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Advocates willing to practice predominantly within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practice in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Advocate from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.\n\nThe advantage of having the State Bar Councils is that the workload of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any Advocate individually, as so provided under the Advocates Act, 1961.\n\nThe process of being entitled to practice in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India (or from one of the four recognized Universities in the [[United Kingdom]]) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner, the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practicing in India is met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practice before courts of India.\n\nEnrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as an Advocate and is required to maintain a standard of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes \"Rules of Conduct\" to be observed by the Advocates in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.\n\nAll Advocates in India are at the same level and are recognized as such. Any distinction, if any, is made only on the basis of seniority, which implies the length of practice at the Bar. As a recognition of law practice and specialization in an area of law, there is a concept of conferral of Senior Advocate status. An Advocate may be recognized by the Judges of the High Court (in case of an Advocate practicing before that High Court) or by the Supreme Court (in case of the Advocate practicing before the Supreme Court). While the conferral of Senior Advocate status not only implies distinction and fame of the Advocate, it also requires the Senior Advocate to follow higher standards of conduct and some distinct rules. Also, a Senior Advocate is not allowed to interact directly with the clients. He can only take briefs from other Advocates and argue on the basis of the details given by them. From the year 2010 onward a mandatory rule is made for lawyers passing out from the year 2009-10 to sit for an evaluation test named AIBE (All India Bar Exam) for one to qualify as an advocate and practice in the courts. However, to practice law before the Supreme Court of India, Advocates must first appear for and qualify in the Supreme Court Advocate on Record Examination conducted by the Supreme Court.\n\nFurther, under the Constitutional structure, there is a provision for the elevation of Advocates as judges of High Courts and Supreme Court. The only requirement is the Advocate must have ten years standing before the High Court(/s) or before the Supreme Court to be eligible for such. (Article 217 and 124 of the Constitution of India for High Courts and Supreme Court respectively)\n\n==Bangladesh==\nIn Bangladesh, after passing the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]], one can apply for admission for studying Law in Universities. There are several [[Universities in Bangladesh|public and private universities]] which provide [[Bachelor of Laws]] and [[Master of Laws]] degree in Bangladesh. Generally, the LL.B. course is equivalent to a four-year bachelor's degree. Graduate lawyers have to seat for and pass the Bar Council Exam to become advocates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Students lock Bar Council|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/09/04/students-lock-bar-council|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=[[bdnews24.com]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183720/http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/09/04/students-lock-bar-council|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Advocate of Supreme Court===\nBy passing the [[Bangladesh Bar Council]] Exam, advocates are eligible to practice in the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] and other courts. A license is obtained after successful completion of two year's practice in the lower courts by applicant, which is reviewed by a body of the relevant provincial Bar Council. Most applications after successful completion of the requirement, are accepted.\n\n==Sri Lanka==\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] (formally Ceylon) till 1973 Advocate was a practitioner in a [[court|court of law]] who is legally qualified to [[Prosecutor|prosecute]] and defend actions in such court on the [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] of clients. Advocates had to pass the HSC exam and enter the [[Ceylon Law College]] and follow the advocates course and sit for the relevant exams. Thereafter, they would have to practice under a senior advocate before being [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] for admission as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. Members of the English, Scottish and Irish Bars are permitted to be admitted to an Barrister without examination on payment of a fee. Ceylonese Advocates with three years standing were allowed to be called to the English Bar without examination on completing three terms. The ''Justice Law No. 44 of 1973'' of the [[National State Assembly]] created a single group of practitioners known as [[Attorneys in Sri Lanka|Attorneys-at-law]]. The current equivalent to an advocate is a [[counsel]] who is a trial lawyer distinguished from an instructing attorney.\n\n==Brazil==\nIn [[Brazil]], the [[bar examination]] occurs nationally in March, August, and December. These examinations are unified and organized by the [[Order of Attorneys of Brazil]]. After 5 years in [[law school]], Brazilian law students are required to take the bar exam, which consists of 2 phases: the [[multiple choice]] test and written test, without any further requirements.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil]] applies restrictions on professional practice of law in the fulfillment of the [[requirement]]s, which may include in addition to [[graduation]], formal submission of the [[applicant]] in the proficiency [[Performance test (assessment)|tests]]. The Order exam is tied to Law No. 8609 of 4/7/1994:\n\n\"'''Article 8''': For registration as an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] is needed: IV - \"To pass the Examination of the Order;\"\n\nWithin its powers expressly granted by the Constitution, the [[ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] [[legislator|legislative]] demands that whoever wishes to pursue the [[legal]] [[profession]] possess the [[academic degree|degree]] of [[Bachelor of Law]] and approval of Examination of Order, whose preparation and implementation is done by their own class. The Constitution itself provides for the restriction, and the [[Statute]] of [[Law]] requires the examination.\n\nThe bar exam in Brazil approves very few students and is considered a hard exam.  For instance, in February 2014, the Bar association made a release stating that only 19.64% of students had been approved in the last exam and were able to register as a lawyer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oab.org.br/noticia/26632/com-novidades-oab-divulga-resultado-do-xi-exame-de-ordem-unificado |title=OAB releases the results of the XI Unified Bar Exam (in Portuguese) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014-02-03 |website=Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil |publisher=OAB |accessdate=2015-01-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409105839/http://www.oab.org.br/noticia/26632/com-novidades-oab-divulga-resultado-do-xi-exame-de-ordem-unificado |archivedate=2014-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Netherlands==\n\nIn Dutch law, the law relating to the Advocates is the Advocates Act. Under the Act, the Dutch bar association (Orde van Advocaten) regulates the professional conduct and the professional education of the advocates.\n\nA Dutch advocate has to complete Dutch bar education and fulfill certain requirements (which may vary among the various judicial regions within the Netherlands) under the supervision of a senior advocate for a period of at least three years, called the 'advocate-stage'. After completing the bar education exams, the junior advocate is admitted unconditionally to the Dutch bar.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Advocatus]]\n* [[Barrister]]\n* [[Lawspeaker]]\n* [[Jurist]]\n* [[Ombudsman]]\n* [[Solicitor]]\n* [[Solicitor-Advocate]]\n* [[Advocate General]]\n* [[Judge Advocate General]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180723223847/http://www.learningthelaw.in/2017/02/roles-and-responsibilities-of-advocate.html Roles and responsibilities of an Advocate in the Court of Law]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|advocate}}\n{{Commons category|Advocates}}\n*[http://www.advocates.org.uk The Faculty of Advocates official website]\n*[http://www.alaki.fi Association of licensed attorneys in Finland]\n\n[[Category:Legal professions]]\n[[Category:Scots law general titles]]\n[[Category:Solicitors]]\n[[Category:Advocates| ]]\n", "name_user": "106.79.226.251", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"}

Before his accession to the presidency, Ford served as the 40th [[vice president of the United States]] from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].\n\nBorn in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and raised in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], Ford attended the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Yale Law School]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he enlisted in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]], serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a [[lieutenant commander]]. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the [[U.S. Representative|U.S. representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]]. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]]. In December 1973, two months after the [[Spiro Agnew#Criminal investigation and resignation|resignation of Spiro Agnew]], Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[25th Amendment]] by President [[Richard Nixon]]. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency.

The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[international waters]] and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.<ref>Gawthorpe, A.

Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try to convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.<ref>Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47\u201383.</ref> Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.<ref>Gawthorpe, \"The Ford Administration and Security Policy\", p. 711.</ref>\n\nAt administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as \"the paper tigers of Saigon\" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.<ref>Gawthorpe, \"The Ford Administration and Security Policy\", pp. 710\u2013714.</ref>\n\n===Assassination attempts===\n{{Main|Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|Gerald Ford assassination attempt in San Francisco}}\n{{See also|Sara Jane Moore|Oliver Sipple}}\n[[File:AV89-26-14 600d.jpg|thumb|alt=A chaotic scene of motorcade vehicles surrounded by crowd of people including police and press|Reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt]]\n\nFord was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency.

After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a \"blanket pardon\" for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed to shift just 11,000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having \"lusted in my heart\" for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debate]] since [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.\n\nTelevised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they \"gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer\". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.\" Ford also said that he did not \"believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1976/|title=1976 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence.

Before his accession to the presidency, Ford served as the 40th [[vice president of the United States]] from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].\n\nBorn in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and raised in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], Ford attended the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Yale Law School]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he enlisted in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]], serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a [[lieutenant commander]]. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the [[U.S. Representative|U.S. representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]]. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]]. In December 1973, two months after the [[Spiro Agnew#Criminal investigation and resignation|resignation of Spiro Agnew]], Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[25th Amendment]] by President [[Richard Nixon]]. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. His [[List of Presidents of the United States by time in office|895 day-long presidency is the shortest]] in U.S. history for any president who did not die in office.\n\nAs president, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], which marked a move toward [[d\u00e9tente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the collapse of [[South Vietnam]] nine months into his presidency, [[US involvement in the Vietnam War|U.S. involvement]] in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973\u20131975|ended]].

He narrowly lost the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger, former Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nFollowing his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship.

The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964\u20131974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.<ref name=\"Lenczowski\" /> As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].\n\n[[File:Gerald Ford with Anwar Sadat in Salzburg 1975.jpg|thumb|Ford with [[Anwar Sadat]] in Salzburg, 1975]]\n\nIn the continuing [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress. Ford considered it \"stalling\" and wrote, \"Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.\"<ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240</ref> During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:\n{{Quote|I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations.

On May 21, Ford \"experienced a real shock\" when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be \"responsive\" to Israel's request for $2.59&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.59|1975|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in military and economic aid.

The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South.

Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try to convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.<ref>Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47\u201383.</ref> Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.<ref>Gawthorpe, \"The Ford Administration and Security Policy\", p. 711.</ref>\n\nAt administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as \"the paper tigers of Saigon\" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom.

After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a \"blanket pardon\" for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed to shift just 11,000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having \"lusted in my heart\" for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debate]] since [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.\n\nTelevised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they \"gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer\". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.\" Ford also said that he did not \"believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1976/|title=1976 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence.
