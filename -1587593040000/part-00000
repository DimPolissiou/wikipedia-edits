In a similar way, it is the cache-aware analogy to the [[parallel random-access machine]] (PRAM). The PEM model consists of a number of processors, together with their respective private caches and a shared main memory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Model ==\n=== Definition ===\nThe PEM model<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> is a combination of the EM model and the PRAM model. The PEM model is a computation model which consists of <math>P</math> processors and a two-level [[Memory hierarchy | memory hierarchy]]. This memory hierarchy consists of a large [[External memory algorithm | external memory]] (main memory) of size <math>N</math> and <math>P</math> small [[Cache (computing) | internal memories (caches)]]. The processors share the main memory. Each cache is exclusive to a single processor. A processor can't access another\u2019s cache. The caches have a size <math>M</math> which is partitioned in blocks of size <math>B</math>. The processors can only perform operations on data which are in their cache. The data can be transferred between the main memory and the cache in blocks of size <math>B</math>.\n\n=== I/O complexity ===\nThe [[Programming complexity | complexity measure]] of the PEM model is the I/O complexity<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref>, which determines the number of parallel blocks transfers between the main memory and the cache. During a parallel block transfer each processor can transfer a block. So if <math>P</math> processors load parallelly a data block of size <math>B</math> form the main memory into their caches, it is considered as an I/O complexity of <math>O(1)</math> not <math>O(P)</math>. A program in the PEM model should minimize the data transfer between main memory and caches and operate as much as possible on the data in the caches.\n\n=== Read/write conflicts ===\nIn the PEM model, there is no [[Computer network | direct communication network]] between the P processors. The processors have to communicate indirectly over the main memory. If multiple processors try to access the same block in main memory concurrently read/write conflicts<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> occur. Like in the PRAM model, three different variations of this problem are considered:\n*Concurrent Read Concurrent Write (CRCW): The same block in main memory can be read and written by multiple processors concurrently.\n*Concurrent Read Exclusive Write (CREW): The same block in main memory can be read by multiple processors concurrently. Only one processor can write to a block at a time.\n*Exclusive Read Exclusive Write (EREW): The same block in main memory cannot be read or written by multiple processors concurrently. Only one processor can access a block at a time.\nThe following two algorithms<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> solve the CREW and EREW problem if <math>P \\leq B</math> processors write to the same block simultaneously.\nA first approach is to serialize the write operations. Only one processor after the other writes to the block. This results in a total of <math>P</math> parallel block transfers. A second approach needs <math>O(\\log(P))</math> parallel block transfers and an additional block for each processor. The main idea is to schedule the write operations in a [[Reduce (parallel pattern) | binary tree fashion]] and gradually combine the data into a single block. In the first round <math>P</math> processors combine their blocks into <math>P/2</math> blocks. Then <math>P/2</math> processors combine the <math>P/2</math> blocks into <math>P/4</math>.

In a similar way, it is the cache-aware analogy to the [[parallel random-access machine]] (PRAM). The PEM model consists of a number of processors, together with their respective private caches and a shared main memory.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Model ==\n=== Definition ===\nThe PEM model<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> is a combination of the EM model and the PRAM model. The PEM model is a computation model which consists of <math>P</math> processors and a two-level [[Memory hierarchy | memory hierarchy]]. This memory hierarchy consists of a large [[External memory algorithm | external memory]] (main memory) of size <math>N</math> and <math>P</math> small [[Cache (computing) | internal memories (caches)]]. The processors share the main memory. Each cache is exclusive to a single processor. A processor can't access another\u2019s cache. The caches have a size <math>M</math> which is partitioned in blocks of size <math>B</math>. The processors can only perform operations on data which are in their cache. The data can be transferred between the main memory and the cache in blocks of size <math>B</math>.\n\n=== I/O complexity ===\nThe [[Programming complexity | complexity measure]] of the PEM model is the I/O complexity<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref>, which determines the number of parallel blocks transfers between the main memory and the cache. During a parallel block transfer each processor can transfer a block. So if <math>P</math> processors load parallelly a data block of size <math>B</math> form the main memory into their caches, it is considered as an I/O complexity of <math>O(1)</math> not <math>O(P)</math>. A program in the PEM model should minimize the data transfer between main memory and caches and operate as much as possible on the data in the caches.\n\n=== Read / Write conflicts ===\nIn the PEM model, there is no [[Computer network | direct communication network]] between the P processors. The processors have to communicate indirectly over the main memory. If multiple processors try to access the same block in main memory concurrently read/write conflicts<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> occur. Like in the PRAM model, three different variations of this problem are considered:\n*Concurrent Read Concurrent Write (CRCW): The same block in main memory can be read and written by multiple processors concurrently.\n*Concurrent Read Exclusive Write (CREW): The same block in main memory can be read by multiple processors concurrently. Only one processor can write to a block at a time.\n*Exclusive Read Exclusive Write (EREW): The same block in main memory cannot be read or written by multiple processors concurrently. Only one processor can access a block at a time.\nThe following two algorithms<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Arge|first=Lars|last2=Goodrich|first2=Michael T.|last3=Nelson|first3=Michael|last4=Sitchinava|first4=Nodari|date=2008|title=Fundamental parallel algorithms for private-cache chip multiprocessors|journal=Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures - SPAA '08|pages=197|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1378533.1378573|isbn=9781595939739}}</ref> solve the CREW and EREW problem if <math>P \\leq B</math> processors write to the same block simultaneously.\nA first approach is to serialize the write operations. Only one processor after the other writes to the block. This results in a total of <math>P</math> parallel block transfers. A second approach needs <math>O(\\log(P))</math> parallel block transfers and an additional block for each processor. The main idea is to schedule the write operations in a [[Reduce (parallel pattern) | binary tree fashion]] and gradually combine the data into a single block. In the first round <math>P</math> processors combine their blocks into <math>P/2</math> blocks. Then <math>P/2</math> processors combine the <math>P/2</math> blocks into <math>P/4</math>. This procedure is continued until all the data is combined in one block.\n\n=== Comparison to other models ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Model\n!Multi-core\n!Cache-aware\n|-\n|[[Random-access machine]] (RAM)\n|No\n|No\n|-\n|[[Parallel random-access machine]] (PRAM)\n|Yes\n|No\n|-\n|[[External memory algorithm|External memory]] (EM)\n|No\n|Yes\n|-\n|'''Parallel external memory (PEM)'''\n|Yes\n|Yes\n|}\n\n== Examples ==\n<!-- Discuss if code folding is ok with respect to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Scrolling_lists_and_collapsible_content -->\n\n\n=== Multiway partitioning ===\nLet <math>M=\\{m_1,...,m_{d-1}\\}</math> be a vector of d-1 pivots sorted in increasing order.

This abbey is called \"[[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]\" and was crafted in 640 AD at the outskirts of the Mountains of Alqosh. It was used as the Seat for many [[patriarchs]] of the [[Church of the East]]. From this monastery came [[Yohannan Sulaqa]], who decided to unite with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1553 AD and established the ''Church of Assyria and Mosul'', which by the 18th century had become renamed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] by Rome.\n\nBefore that, all of the inhabitants of Alqosh, like their brothers in other Assyrian towns, followed what is erroneously called the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] faith, but actuality were a part of the [[Church of the East]]. From 1610 to 1617, the Patriarchate of Alqosh, under Mar Eliyya VIII, entered in [[Full Communion]] with [[Rome]]. the union was reinstated later in 1771 when the patriarch Eliya Denkha signed a Catholic confession of faith, although no formal union resulted till the reign of patriarch [[Yohannan Hormizd|Yohannan VIII (Eliya) Hormizd]] (1760\u20131838).<ref name=\"Frazee\">{{cite book |last=Frazee|first=Charles A.|title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453\u20131923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=210}}</ref>\n\n===Prophet Nahum and Alqosh===\nThe ancient synagogue in Alqosh reportedly contains the tomb of the prophet [[Nahum]], who correctly predicted the end of the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]].

It was common for [[Iraqi Jews]] to make a pilgrimage to Alqosh during [[Shavuot]]. \u201cHe who has not made the pilgrimage to Nahum\u2019s tomb has not yet known real pleasure,\u201d was a common saying.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neurink|first1=Judit|title=Kurdistan needs help to preserve its Jewish heritage|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Kurdistan-needs-help-to-preserve-its-Jewish-heritage-407996|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Destruction==\nThroughout its history, Alqosh has fallen victim to many calamities, most due to their oppressive Muslim neighbors and various overlords. Many attacks occurred after Alqosh started to house the abbey of [[Rabban Hormizd]], which was used as the Seat for several patriarchs of the Chaldean Church, as it attracted the attention of several Muslims looking to harass their Christian neighbors.\n\nAccording to the [[testimony]], written in a letter by the Qasha Habash Bin Jomaa from 1746, he describes; \"... first they attacked [[Karamles]] and stole its peoples valuables and kidnapped many of its children and women. They then did the same to the inhabitants of [[Bartella]] they killed many of her men, stole their valuables, and also kidnapped its children and women. They did the same to the people of Tel Keppe and Alqosh, however, many of those two neighboring villages took refuge at the Monastery of Rabban Hirmizd. There they were surrounded by the soldiers of Nader Shah who attacked them and then massacred them. There they committed horrendous crimes that I just don't have the stomach to describe!\"\n[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh10.JPG|thumb|left|Party in Alqosh]]\n\nin 1828, Alqosh was attacked by the army of Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadeya, who was instigated by some of his Muslim subjects to attack the Rabban Hirmizd Monastery which he did.

A report by the United Nations stated that 504 Assyrians at once migrated to Alqosh. Many Assyrians from Mosul and Baghdad since the post-2003 Iraq war have fled to Alqosh for safety.

This abbey is called \"[[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]\" and was crafted in 640 AD at the outskirts of the Mountains of Alqosh. It was used as the Seat for many [[patriarchs]] of the [[Church of the East]]. From this monastery came [[Yohannan Sulaqa]], who decided to unite with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1553 AD and established the ''Church of Assyria and Mosul'', which by the 18th century had become renamed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] by Rome.\n\nBefore that, all of the inhabitants of Alqosh, like their brothers in other Assyrian towns, followed what is erroneously called the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] faith, but actuality were a part of the [[Church of the East]]. From 1610 to 1617, the Patriarchate of Alqosh, under Mar Eliyya VIII, entered in [[Full Communion]] with [[Rome]]. the union was reinstated later in 1771 when the patriarch Eliya Denkha signed a Catholic confession of faith, although no formal union resulted till the reign of patriarch [[Yohannan Hormizd|Yohannan VIII (Eliya) Hormizd]] (1760\u20131838).<ref name=\"Frazee\">{{cite book |last=Frazee|first=Charles A.|title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453\u20131923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=210}}</ref>\n\n===Prophet Nahum and Alqosh===\nThe ancient synagogue in Alqosh reportedly contains the tomb of the prophet [[Nahum]], who correctly predicted the end of the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]]. Nahum's bones have been relocated to a nearby church. It was common for [[Iraqi Jews]] to make a pilgrimage to Alqosh during [[Shavuot]]. \u201cHe who has not made the pilgrimage to Nahum\u2019s tomb has not yet known real pleasure,\u201d was a common saying.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neurink|first1=Judit|title=Kurdistan needs help to preserve its Jewish heritage|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Kurdistan-needs-help-to-preserve-its-Jewish-heritage-407996|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Destruction==\nThroughout its history, Alqosh has fallen victim to many calamities, most due to their oppressive Muslim neighbors and various overlords. Many attacks occurred after Alqosh started to house the abbey of [[Rabban Hormizd]], which was used as the Seat for several patriarchs of the Chaldean Church, as it attracted the attention of several Muslims looking to harass their Christian neighbors.\n\nAccording to the [[testimony]], written in a letter by the Qasha Habash Bin Jomaa from 1746, he describes; \"... first they attacked [[Karamles]] and stole its peoples valuables and kidnapped many of its children and women. They then did the same to the inhabitants of [[Bartella]] they killed many of her men, stole their valuables, and also kidnapped its children and women. They did the same to the people of Tel Keppe and Alqosh, however, many of those two neighboring villages took refuge at the Monastery of Rabban Hirmizd. There they were surrounded by the soldiers of Nader Shah who attacked them and then massacred them. There they committed horrendous crimes that I just don't have the stomach to describe!\"\n[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh10.JPG|thumb|left|Party in Alqosh]]\n\nin 1828, Alqosh was attacked by the army of Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadeya, who was instigated by some of his Muslim subjects to attack the Rabban Hirmizd Monastery which he did.

A report by the United Nations stated that 504 Assyrians at once migrated to Alqosh. Many Assyrians from Mosul and Baghdad since the post-2003 Iraq war have fled to Alqosh for safety.
