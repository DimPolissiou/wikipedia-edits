He was played by [[Jackie Coogan]] in the [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|original television series]], by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in the two feature films, by [[Nick Kroll]] in the 2019 animated feature, by [[Patrick Thomas (actor)|Patrick Thomas]] in the direct-for-video film ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', and by [[Michael Roberds]] in ''[[The New Addams Family]]''. In the [[The Addams Family (musical)|Broadway musical]], the part was originated by [[Kevin Chamberlin]], with [[Brad Oscar]] taking over on March 8, 2011.\n\n==Character==\nUncle Fester is a completely hairless, hunched, and barrel-shaped man with dark, sunken eyes and often a deranged smile. He always wears a heavy, full-length [[Fur clothing|fur coat]]. Fester was derived from a character drawn by cartoonist [[Charles Addams]], although these were single-page cartoons, with no stories or character names. Nevertheless, the character is recognizable in a number of cartoons, both by his appearance (bald, stooping, sunken eyes) and behavior (e.g. turning the shower to a special \"scalding\" setting, feeding his garden plants blood plasma, and releasing an eagle on the neighbor's [[homing pigeon]]s). While he is occasionally seen with the rest of the family, particularly on anthology covers, he is also seen on his own more often than the others. He is sometimes indicated to live in a small shack surrounded by a wrought-iron fence.\n\nFester has a strange ability to generate electricity. He would often demonstrate this by putting a light bulb in his mouth, which would illuminate, accompanied by a loud, crackling noise. He claims to possess 110 [[volt]]s of power in one episode of the sitcom, while in another episode he demonstrated his \"magnetic\" quality by levitating a metal paperweight up to his hand. When struck directly on the head by a fired cannonball, he appears only mildly dazed, while the cannonball bounces off his head.\n\nUncle Fester at times has severe migraines but appears to enjoy them. Fester relieves his migraines by placing his head in a large screw press and tightening it to levels that normal people would not be able to withstand. At times, Fester uses the screw press on his head simply for enjoyment.\n\nDespite Uncle Fester's menacing look and bizarre behavior, he is gentle and caring to everyone. He shows great respect to Gomez and Morticia. He has always exhibited love and great care to his niece and nephews, despite their frequent naughtiness.\n\nIn the original [[situation comedy|sitcom]] of the 1960s, Fester is said to be [[Morticia Addams|Morticia]]'s maternal uncle (his name rhymes with Morticia's mother Hester's), but from the 1970s onward, he is [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]]'s brother. In all adaptations, he is either uncle or great-uncle to [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]]. He is known as \"T\u00edo F\u00e9tido\" in Spain, \"T\u00edo Lucas\" in Spanish-speaking countries and \"F\u00e9tide\" in France. In Brazil, he has three names: \"Tio Chico\" (original series and cartoon), \"Tio Fun\u00e9reo\" (movies) and \"Tio Fester\" (Broadway Musical).\n\n==Live action TV series==\nIn the 1960s television series, Fester (played by [[Jackie Coogan]]) is uncle to Morticia Addams. In one episode, he became perplexed when asked his last name, suggesting he has somehow forgotten it. In several episodes, Fester refers to the Addams lineage as if it were his own, possibly implying some degree of intertwined [[consanguinity]] in both their family lines, but the flashbacks in the episodes \"Morticia's Romance, Parts 1 and 2,\" clearly establish him as Morticia's uncle, brother of her mother, Hester Frump, a.k.a. Granny Frump ([[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]), whose maiden name was similarly unrevealed. (Thus, Morticia's mother and uncle have rhyming names, Hester and Fester.) In various episodes, he was a partner in typical sitcom schemes with Gomez, Morticia, or Grandmama Addams, indicating no real preference for any family member over others.\n\nFester's known ancestry dates back to his Great-Grandfather Blob (not to be confused with Gomez's Cousin Blob, a two-headed ghost), who received the gift of a sacred ruby after he had pried it from the head of a Hindu (to whom it was giving a terrible headache). The ruby remained in the family until Fester unthinkingly used his [[slingshot]] to hurl it at a yowling stray [[cat]]. \"Well, it was the only rock in the house!\" he said in his defense.\n\nPer the 1960s sitcom, little is known of Fester's childhood, save that his father (Morticia's maternal grandfather) was an excruciatingly strict man who severely disciplined him, paddling him even when he was good and paying him to stay out of public (Fester considered this to be experienced in \"public relations\"). He refused to allow Fester to even touch a battleaxe (a treasured toy among people with the Addams's macabre tastes) until he was eight. As an adult, Fester defended his father's strictness, pointing to his own character as proof of its effectiveness: \"I didn't become what I am by accident! I had an upbringing like no other!\" Sometime prior to Morticia's marriage to Gomez, Fester worked as a newspaper columnist, writing advice for the lovelorn, but left that job because people kept suing him.\n\nFester has also offered contradictory information about his educational background. In the sitcom's first episode, he notes that he never went to school (\"And look how [well] I turned out!\"), but he later claims to have failed [[recess (break)|recess]] three times. As an adult, Fester took correspondence courses in various subjects, and his educational endeavors occasionally formed an episode's main plot. It may be from one such course that he obtained his fraternity paddle, which he once threatened to use on [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] in imitation of his father's punishment style; however, like many an uncle, Fester proved to have more bark than bite in dealing with the children. When he suspects someone of maligning, cheating or otherwise mistreating anyone in the family, Fester is ever ready with his [[blunderbuss]] \"Genevieve\", eager to \"shoot 'em in the back!\" However, he is far less eager in meeting a malefactor in a face-to-face duel; he was briefly enthusiastic about a pistol duel with an enemy until he asked, somewhat timidly, \"Does he get one too?...''Loaded''?\"\n\nAnother prized possession was his cannon, \"Old Reliable\", which he normally kept in his bedroom. Fester maintained a treehouse in the Addams yard and frequently retreated to his closet to think. After receiving the gift of a motorcycle in the episode \"The Addams Family Meets a [[Beatnik]]\", Fester often drove it through the living room, inevitably crashing in the conservatory (several episodes used identical [[stock footage|recycled footage]] of this scenario). Fester also collects three-dollar bills.\n\nThe 1998 live-action series continues the tradition of having Fester (played by Canadian actor [[Michael Roberds]]) as Gomez's biological brother, yet between this version and the 1960s series, this is the only visible difference. In furtherance on the original series running gag of Uncle Fester being able to store electricity, one episode has Uncle Fester nearly kidnapped by aliens so as to be used to power their spaceship; the Aliens leave Uncle Fester behind-but only after \"cloning\" him for their spaceship journey home.\n\n==Animated TV series==\nIn the [[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|first animated series]] by [[Hanna-Barbera]], Jackie Coogan reprised his role as Fester. He also voiced that same character on an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. In the [[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|second animated series]] by [[Hanna-Barbera]], Fester was voiced by [[Rip Taylor]] (as Coogan had died in 1984). In this series, Fester is perhaps the most loving of self-inflicted injury. He would allow other members (usually [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]) to harm him any way they can, but his greatest fondness was blowing himself up. As a running gag, Fester would never believe [[Grandmama (Addams Family)|Grandmama]]'s predictions until she predicts something that causes him great harm (or in his case, great joy). Fester also is very fond of the Addamses' next-door neighbor, Norman Normanmayer, a boring person controlling an [[underwear]] empire, who hates Fester (and the whole Addams family) for his strangeness (on an occasion, Fester comes on a visit through the sewer pipes). Fester seems quite oblivious of the fact that Norman hates him and, possibly due to the Addams family nature, thinks that all the angry and aggressive outbreaks are a sign of affection.\n\nThis Fester also introduces himself, through his self-made [[comic book]]s, as \"Festerman\", a [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] hero with a weakness to chimneys, who gives his flying cape to enemies upon request\u2014so as to fall and would bring villains to their knees...simply by enjoying all the harm they would give him to the point of wearing them out. During this series, he is given a musical-type episode about the \"Fester Way\", his own, strange way of life.\n\n==Film==\nIn the movie, ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', Fester (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]) is the long-lost brother of Gomez Addams. He was believed to have been lost in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] for twenty-five years. A [[loan shark]] named Abigail Craven ([[Elizabeth Wilson]]) conspires to steal the Addams' fortune using her son, Gordon, who displays an eerie resemblance to the missing Fester. On the night that the Addams' hold a [[s\u00e9ance]] to contact Fester's [[spirit]], Gordon shows up at their door, posing as Fester.  Although he is baffled and horrified by the Addams' at first, Gordon begins to take a liking to the family and their strange ways. In the end, he disobeys his mother and helps Gomez and his family get their house back. It is later discovered that Gordon ''is'' actually Fester, found by Abigail; his accident has caused him to suffer from [[amnesia]], which is eventually cured by a lightning strike to his head. As revealed in the movie's ending scene, it is also subsequent to said abnormal [[electric shock]] that Fester acquires his ability to conduct electricity. In Gomez's home movies from their childhood, Fester is shown to be hairless as a child (although in a rather peculiar detail, as Gordon Craven, he is seen shaving his head). \nFester also appears in the film's sequel (again played by Lloyd), ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. This film centers around Fester's marriage to Debbie Jellinsky ([[Joan Cusack]]), the recently hired [[nanny]] who wishes to murder Fester and inherit his share of the Addams fortune.\n\nFester again appears in the direct-to-video film ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', here played by Patrick Thomas. He is portrayed as a mad scientist reminiscent of old Grade-B horror films. He creates a dog named \"Butcher\" as a birthday present for Pugsley\u2014a dog that mutates into a hair-devouring brute whenever someone says \"good boy.\" In the end, Butcher attacks Cousin Itt\u2014who is, understandably, quite nervous around him.\n\nFester is voiced by [[Nick Kroll]] in [[The Addams Family (2019 film)|2019 computer-animated adaptation of ''The Addams Family'']].\n\n==Musical==\nIn the [[The Addams Family (musical)|musical]], Uncle Fester was played by [[Kevin Chamberlin]] in the original broadway cast. Chamberlain received a Tony nomination for the role. He was later played by [[Brad Oscar]], Blake Hammond, [[Russell Dykstra]] and Shaun Rice. This incarnation of Fester serves as the musical's narrator and is in love with the moon. The subject of love is apparently his \"specialty\", and he is able to play the ukulele when he sings a love song to the moon. He also seems to communicate with the ancestors throughout the show more than the other characters.\n\n==Video games==\nUncle Fester has appeared in several Addams Family [[video game]]s as a playable character. He is the protagonist of ''[[Fester's Quest]]'', a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game, and the main playable character in the ''[[Addams Family Values (video game)|Addams Family Values]]'' [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game. He is also the main character in \"[[Nova Productions|Electrifying]]\" arcade machine, where simulated \"electrical shocks\" are passed through the player as they hold on to 2 handles.\n\n==References==\n[[Ningen_Isu|Ningen Isu]]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Addams Family}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fester}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938]]\n[[Category:The Addams Family characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the author who uses this as a pseudonym|Uncle Fester (author)|the band previously known as Uncle Fester|UFX}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Uncle Fester\n| image              = Jackie Coogan as Uncle Fester (The Addams Family, 1966).jpg\n| image_size         = 250px\n| caption            = [[Jackie Coogan]] as Uncle Fester\n| creator            = [[Charles Addams]]\n| portrayer          = [[Jackie Coogan]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Patrick Thomas (actor)|Patrick Thomas]], [[Michael Roberds]], [[Kevin Chamberlin]], [[Brad Oscar]], [[Russell Dykstra]]\n| voice              = [[Rip Taylor]] (1992 animated series)<br>[[Nick Kroll]] (2019 film)\n| alias              = None\n| species            = Human\n| spouse             = Debbie Jellinsky (deceased)\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = [[Morticia Addams|Morticia]] (originally niece, sister-in-law in recent movies)<br>[[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] (originally nephew-in-law, younger brother in recent movies)<br>[[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] (niece) <br>[[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] (nephew) <br>Pubert Addams (nephew) <br>[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] (originally sister-in-law, only Morticia's mother in movies) <br>[[Cousin Itt|Itt]] (cousin)\n}}\n'''Uncle Fester''' is a member of the fictional [[The Addams Family|Addams Family]].

He is known as \"T\u00edo F\u00e9tido\" in Spain, \"T\u00edo Lucas\" in Spanish-speaking countries and \"F\u00e9tide\" in France. In Brazil, he has three names: \"Tio Chico\" (original series and cartoon), \"Tio Fun\u00e9reo\" (movies) and \"Tio Fester\" (Broadway Musical).\n\n==Live action TV series==\nIn the 1960s television series, Fester (played by [[Jackie Coogan]]) is uncle to Morticia Addams. In one episode, he became perplexed when asked his last name, suggesting he has somehow forgotten it. In several episodes, Fester refers to the Addams lineage as if it were his own, possibly implying some degree of intertwined [[consanguinity]] in both their family lines, but the flashbacks in the episodes \"Morticia's Romance, Parts 1 and 2,\" clearly establish him as Morticia's uncle, brother of her mother, Hester Frump, a.k.a. Granny Frump ([[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]), whose maiden name was similarly unrevealed. (Thus, Morticia's mother and uncle have rhyming names, Hester and Fester.) In various episodes, he was a partner in typical sitcom schemes with Gomez, Morticia, or Grandmama Addams, indicating no real preference for any family member over others.\n\nFester's known ancestry dates back to his Great-Grandfather Blob (not to be confused with Gomez's Cousin Blob, a two-headed ghost), who received the gift of a sacred ruby after he had pried it from the head of a Hindu (to whom it was giving a terrible headache). The ruby remained in the family until Fester unthinkingly used his [[slingshot]] to hurl it at a yowling stray [[cat]]. \"Well, it was the only rock in the house!\" he said in his defense.\n\nPer the 1960s sitcom, little is known of Fester's childhood, save that his father (Morticia's maternal grandfather) was an excruciatingly strict man who severely disciplined him, paddling him even when he was good and paying him to stay out of public (Fester considered this to be experienced in \"public relations\"). He refused to allow Fester to even touch a battleaxe (a treasured toy among people with the Addams's macabre tastes) until he was eight. As an adult, Fester defended his father's strictness, pointing to his own character as proof of its effectiveness: \"I didn't become what I am by accident! I had an upbringing like no other!\" Sometime prior to Morticia's marriage to Gomez, Fester worked as a newspaper columnist, writing advice for the lovelorn, but left that job because people kept suing him.\n\nFester has also offered contradictory information about his educational background. In the sitcom's first episode, he notes that he never went to school (\"And look how [well] I turned out!\"), but he later claims to have failed [[recess (break)|recess]] three times. As an adult, Fester took correspondence courses in various subjects, and his educational endeavors occasionally formed an episode's main plot. It may be from one such course that he obtained his fraternity paddle, which he once threatened to use on [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] in imitation of his father's punishment style; however, like many an uncle, Fester proved to have more bark than bite in dealing with the children. When he suspects someone of maligning, cheating or otherwise mistreating anyone in the family, Fester is ever ready with his [[blunderbuss]] \"Genevieve\", eager to \"shoot 'em in the back!\" However, he is far less eager in meeting a malefactor in a face-to-face duel; he was briefly enthusiastic about a pistol duel with an enemy until he asked, somewhat timidly, \"Does he get one too?...''Loaded''?\"\n\nAnother prized possession was his cannon, \"Old Reliable\", which he normally kept in his bedroom. Fester maintained a treehouse in the Addams yard and frequently retreated to his closet to think. After receiving the gift of a motorcycle in the episode \"The Addams Family Meets a [[Beatnik]]\", Fester often drove it through the living room, inevitably crashing in the conservatory (several episodes used identical [[stock footage|recycled footage]] of this scenario). Fester also collects three-dollar bills.\n\nThe 1998 live-action series continues the tradition of having Fester (played by Canadian actor [[Michael Roberds]]) as Gomez's biological brother, yet between this version and the 1960s series, this is the only visible difference. In furtherance on the original series running gag of Uncle Fester being able to store electricity, one episode has Uncle Fester nearly kidnapped by aliens so as to be used to power their spaceship; the Aliens leave Uncle Fester behind-but only after \"cloning\" him for their spaceship journey home.\n\n==Animated TV series==\nIn the [[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|first animated series]] by [[Hanna-Barbera]], Jackie Coogan reprised his role as Fester. He also voiced that same character on an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. In the [[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|second animated series]] by [[Hanna-Barbera]], Fester was voiced by [[Rip Taylor]] (as Coogan had died in 1984). In this series, Fester is perhaps the most loving of self-inflicted injury. He would allow other members (usually [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]) to harm him any way they can, but his greatest fondness was blowing himself up. As a running gag, Fester would never believe [[Grandmama (Addams Family)|Grandmama]]'s predictions until she predicts something that causes him great harm (or in his case, great joy). Fester also is very fond of the Addamses' next-door neighbor, Norman Normanmayer, a boring person controlling an [[underwear]] empire, who hates Fester (and the whole Addams family) for his strangeness (on an occasion, Fester comes on a visit through the sewer pipes). Fester seems quite oblivious of the fact that Norman hates him and, possibly due to the Addams family nature, thinks that all the angry and aggressive outbreaks are a sign of affection.\n\nThis Fester also introduces himself, through his self-made [[comic book]]s, as \"Festerman\", a [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] hero with a weakness to chimneys, who gives his flying cape to enemies upon request\u2014so as to fall and would bring villains to their knees...simply by enjoying all the harm they would give him to the point of wearing them out. During this series, he is given a musical-type episode about the \"Fester Way\", his own, strange way of life.\n\n==Film==\nIn the movie, ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', Fester (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]) is the long-lost brother of Gomez Addams. He was believed to have been lost in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] for twenty-five years. A [[loan shark]] named Abigail Craven ([[Elizabeth Wilson]]) conspires to steal the Addams' fortune using her son, Gordon, who displays an eerie resemblance to the missing Fester. On the night that the Addams' hold a [[s\u00e9ance]] to contact Fester's [[spirit]], Gordon shows up at their door, posing as Fester.  Although he is baffled and horrified by the Addams' at first, Gordon begins to take a liking to the family and their strange ways. In the end, he disobeys his mother and helps Gomez and his family get their house back. It is later discovered that Gordon ''is'' actually Fester, found by Abigail; his accident has caused him to suffer from [[amnesia]], which is eventually cured by a lightning strike to his head. As revealed in the movie's ending scene, it is also subsequent to said abnormal [[electric shock]] that Fester acquires his ability to conduct electricity. In Gomez's home movies from their childhood, Fester is shown to be hairless as a child (although in a rather peculiar detail, as Gordon Craven, he is seen shaving his head). \nFester also appears in the film's sequel (again played by Lloyd), ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. This film centers around Fester's marriage to Debbie Jellinsky ([[Joan Cusack]]), the recently hired [[nanny]] who wishes to murder Fester and inherit his share of the Addams fortune.\n\nFester again appears in the direct-to-video film ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', here played by Patrick Thomas. He is portrayed as a mad scientist reminiscent of old Grade-B horror films. He creates a dog named \"Butcher\" as a birthday present for Pugsley\u2014a dog that mutates into a hair-devouring brute whenever someone says \"good boy.\" In the end, Butcher attacks Cousin Itt\u2014who is, understandably, quite nervous around him.\n\nFester is voiced by [[Nick Kroll]] in [[The Addams Family (2019 film)|2019 computer-animated adaptation of ''The Addams Family'']].\n\n==Musical==\nIn the [[The Addams Family (musical)|musical]], Uncle Fester was played by [[Kevin Chamberlin]] in the original broadway cast. Chamberlain received a Tony nomination for the role. He was later played by [[Brad Oscar]], Blake Hammond, [[Russell Dykstra]] and Shaun Rice. This incarnation of Fester serves as the musical's narrator and is in love with the moon. The subject of love is apparently his \"specialty\", and he is able to play the ukulele when he sings a love song to the moon. He also seems to communicate with the ancestors throughout the show more than the other characters.\n\n==Video games==\nUncle Fester has appeared in several Addams Family [[video game]]s as a playable character. He is the protagonist of ''[[Fester's Quest]]'', a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game, and the main playable character in the ''[[Addams Family Values (video game)|Addams Family Values]]'' [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game. He is also the main character in \"[[Nova Productions|Electrifying]]\" arcade machine, where simulated \"electrical shocks\" are passed through the player as they hold on to 2 handles.\n\n==References==\n[[Ningen_Isu|Ningen Isu]]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Addams Family}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fester}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938]]\n[[Category:The Addams Family characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c5:fd80:ee01:ccba:197e:c288:d56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Fester"}

Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated St Patrick's as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the twelve [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|dioceses]] of the Church of Ireland. The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion. The attendance included foreign dignitaries King [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin of the Belgians]], the [[Vice-President of the United States]] ([[Spiro T. Agnew]] representing [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]]), [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] (representing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]), [[British Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] and former British prime minister [[Edward Heath]].\n\nIn 2006, the cathedral's national prominence was used by a group of 18 Afghan migrants seeking asylum, who occupied it for several days before being persuaded to leave without trouble.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Anne-Marie |title=Timeline: how tense drama at St Patrick's unfolded |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/timeline-how-tense-drama-at-st-patricks-unfolded-26385590.html |website=Independent.ie |publisher=Irish Independent |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Dean and chapter===\n[[File:Saint patrick floor.jpg|thumb|250px|Floor of the cathedral]]\nThe cathedral is headed by the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean]] and governed by the entire chapter, originally 13 in number and having been as many as 30, now numbering up to 28, whose foundation and members' rights derive from the charter of 1191 as approved by Pope Celestine in 1192.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of the Church of Ireland, the dean is the \"immediate ordinary of the cathedral for the purpose of directing the clergy and official and ordering the services\". However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals. The Saint Patrick's Cathedral Group of Parishes which dated as a group from 1970 ceased to exist on the retirement of Dean Robert MacCarthy on 25 January 2012.\n\nA new parish, called the Parish of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen, was created by an act of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/2010/statutes/statute_ch_ii.pdf|title = Statute, Chapter II of 2010|date = 2010|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = |publisher = |last = The Church of Ireland|first = General Synod of}}</ref> This new parish is made up of each of the parishes of St Peter, St Matthias and St Audoen; St Catherine and St James; and St Luke and St Kevin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Our New Parish|url = http://cja.dublin.anglican.org/history/our-new-parish/|website = St Catherine and St James with St Audoen|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}</ref> The rector is the Revd Canon M.

Gardner, Prebendary of Maynooth.\n\n===Current offices===\n* Dean: from 1220 to 2007, the dean held the prebend of [[Clondalkin]] (a prebend since 1191), and churches at Kilberry, Clonwanwyr (Cloney) and Clonardmacgory (Tullaghgory), all later in the Parish of Kilberry. In 1228, the Church of [[Tallaght]] was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of [[St Columb's Cathedral]], Londonderry.\n* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of [[Lusk, County Dublin|Lusk]] in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree.

Doogan, Incumbent of Ballyholme (Down).\n* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).\n* Mulhuddart: [[Mulhuddart]] has a history intertwined with the prebend of [[Castleknock]], the two having been designated from at least 1230. The Revd J.M.

Gardner, Rector of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen (Dublin).\n* Howth: [[Howth]] was one of the founding prebends, and at any early stage, the Archbishops removed the prebendal church from [[Ireland's Eye]] to Howth village. The Prebendary of Howth as of January 2018 is Revd. Canon David Crooks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/installation-canon-david-crooks-prebendary-howth/|title=Installation of Canon David Crooks as Prebendary of Howth|date=2017-01-13|website=St Patrick's Cathedral|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n* [[Rathmichael]]: this has been a prebend since 1227 at latest. At July 2013, Prebendary of [[Rathmichael]] is the Revd C. W.

Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes. Parts of it date from a [[Renatus Harris]] instrument of 1695.<ref>\"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]\" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p79: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> The organ was rebuilt in the 1890s by Henry Willis and Son, in consultation with Sir George Martin.

The [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|dean]] is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was [[Jonathan Swift]].\n\n===Status===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:presidentspew.jpg|thumb|250px|State pew of the [[President of Ireland]], still retains a British Standard carving on the front]]\nThere is almost no precedent for a two-cathedral city, and some believe it was intended that St Patrick's, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, \"regular\") cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick's, and was eventually settled, more-or-less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, ''Pacis Compositio''. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:\n* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church \u2013 records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick's only\n* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese\n* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin\n* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise\n* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church\n* The two cathedrals were to act as one, and shared equally in their freedoms.\n\nOver the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the ''cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough'', and one as the ''National Cathedral'', was developed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Reformation period===\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Choir, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg |thumb|right|The choir of St Patrick's Cathedral]]\n\nIn 1192, [[John Comyn (archbishop)|John Comyn]], first Anglo-Norman [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]], beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the [[River Poddle]], to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the City boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the Archbishop's temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to \"God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick\" on 17 March 1191.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 8</ref>\n\nComyn's charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as Chancellor, Precentor and Treasurer), was confirmed by a [[Papal Bull]] (of [[Pope Celestine III]]) within a year. The thirteen [[prebendaries]] attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.\n\nOver time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the Archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the Dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the Archbishop, adjacent.\n\nWhile it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, [[Henry de Loundres]], was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by [[Pope Innocent III]]. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral,<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 9</ref> the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.\n\nThe basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the Baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the [[Magna Carta]], who was also involved in the construction of Dublin's city walls, and [[Dublin Castle]].\n\nAn order from [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The [[Lady Chapel]] was added around 1270.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nIn 1300, [[Richard de Ferings|Archbishop Ferings]] of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the ''Pacis Compositio'', which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provision to accommodate their shared status.<ref>Bernard, 1924: pp. 73\u201374</ref> For more, see ''Status'' below.\n\nIn 1311 the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] was founded here with [[William de Rodyard]], Dean of St Patrick's, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished, and was suppressed at the [[Reformation]].\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north [[transept]] of the building was used as the parish church of [[Church of St Nicholas Without, (Church of Ireland)|St Nicholas Without]] (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).\n\nThe tower (Minot's Tower) and west [[nave]] were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates [[Thomas Minot]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] 1363\u201375, who oversaw the rebuilding.\n\nFrom the very earliest years there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle \u2013 even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5&nbsp;feet) of the floor.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10, note 3</ref> This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 10</ref>\n\n===Reformation period===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012|reason=Only one citation and that appears only to support a single clause of text about the 1555 charter}}\n[[File:St. Patrick's Jones memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to [[Thomas Jones (Archbishop)|Thomas Jones]], Dean of St Patrick's from 1581 to 1585]]\n\nAfter the [[English Reformation]] (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick's, effective from about 1537), St Patrick's became an [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] church. Most Dubliners followed the same line. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under [[Thomas Cromwell]],{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and neglect led to collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally-flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin [[Hugh Curwen]] is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry's non-Reformed church in the 1530s, then of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] full-blown Protestantism c.1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary's]] reversion of the church to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] until 1567.\n\nUnder [[King Edward VI]], St Patrick's Cathedral was formally suppressed, and the building demoted back to the status of parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to \"Sir Edward Basnet\", the Dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of \u00a360 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and \u00a340 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a court house, the Cathedral Grammar School was established in the then vicar's hall and the deanery given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop's Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.\n\nIn 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] and [[Mary I of England|Mary]] restored the cathedral's privileges<ref>Bernard, 1924: p. 13</ref> and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary's reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new Dean, and the Chapter of St Patrick's, of the \"goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.\", belonging to the Cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).\n\nFollowing the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s\u20131570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick's.\n\nIn 1560, one of Dublin's first public clocks was erected in \"St Patrick's Steeple\".\n\n===17th century===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Lady Chapel, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel in Saint Patrick's Cathedral today.]]\nBy the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge [[Luke Gernon]]  referred to the Cathedral's poor state of repair.<ref>Gernon, Luke  ''A Discourse of Ireland'' 1620 edited by C.S Falkiner 1904</ref>\n\nDuring the stay of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in Dublin, during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|conquest of Ireland]] the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]'s [[Lord Protector]] stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell's disrespect for the [[Anglican]] religion, which he associated with [[Roman Catholicism]] and political [[Cavalier|Royalism]].\n\nAfter the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.\n\nIn 1666, the Cathedral Chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking [[Huguenots]] who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as ''L'Eglise Fran\u00e7aise de St Patrick''. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.\n\nIn 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, a new roof being completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688\u201390, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], [[James II of England|James II]] and his fellow [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] briefly repossessed St Patrick's. James attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] services there with his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters for a time.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bust of [[Jonathan Swift]]]]\n[[File:Dublin, St.Patrick's Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mid 18th century floor plan]]\nThroughout its long history the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], author of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who was [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and \"Irish tracts\" (such as the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'') were given during his stay as Dean.<ref>''History of St Patrick's Cathedral'' by Monck Mason</ref>\n\nHis grave and [[epitaph]] can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] in 1742.\n\nIn 1749, the cathedral spire was added by [[George Semple]]; it remains one of Dublin's landmarks.\n\nIn 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2&nbsp;feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.\n\n====Chivalric chapels====\n* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious [[Order of Saint Patrick]], members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the dis-establishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 the installation ceremony moved to [[St. Patrick's Hall (Dublin)|St Patrick's Hall]], [[Dublin Castle]]. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.\n* ''Paris-Malta obedience'' of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910)]]. The Cathedral contains the so-called ''Dunsany''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th [[Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its [[investiture]] ceremonies and the Dean of the Cathedral is an Ecclesiastical [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the order.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral stones.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross discovered near the church in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral Statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bronze statue of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness by John Henry Foley, erected in 1875.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine |title=The Buildings of Ireland: Dublin |isbn=978-0-300-10923-8 |page=606 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005}}</ref>]]\nBy 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.\n\nIn 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick's was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.\n\nAn attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843\u20131864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.\n\nThe major reconstruction, paid for by [[Benjamin Guinness]], in 1860\u201365, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the [[Victorian era]]; medieval [[Chantry|chantries]] were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.\n\nThough the rebuilding ensured the survival of the Cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely [[medi\u00e6val]] and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin's statue by [[John Henry Foley|JH Foley]] is outside the south door. His son [[Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun|Arthur]] (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of '[[Rebecca]] at the well'; its motto read: 'I was thirsty and ye gave me drink'. In 1901 his son [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] created the adjacent \"St Patrick's Park\" from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.\n\nThe other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the \"two cathedral\" issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick's the national cathedral.\n\n==Present==\n[[File:St Patrick's Cathedral Nave 2, Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The nave as viewed from the western end]]\n\nThe cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland's [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies, hosted by the [[Royal British Legion]] and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.\n\nOn Saturdays in autumn the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of [[Technological University Dublin]].\n\nThe funerals of two Irish presidents, [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], took place there in 1949<ref>[http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Irish-Presidents.aspx The State Pew at St Patrick's Cathedral]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2w1004tq&chunk.id=d0e7854&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=ucpress |author1=Dunleavy, Janet Egleson |author2=Gareth W.

At President Hyde's funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and [[Noel Browne]], stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the [[Holy See]] forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Because President Childers died in office, his [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] was a major state occasion.

However, \"All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter\".<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/1028/1224306622399.html \"An ecumenical matter for St Patrick's'', ''The Irish Times'', 28 October 2011.]</ref>\nThe members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four ''dignities'' or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.\n\nOf the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.\n\n===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===\nAs part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals.

In 1228, the Church of [[Tallaght]] was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of [[St Columb's Cathedral]], Londonderry.\n* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of [[Lusk, County Dublin|Lusk]] in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree. After several changes, a portion of Lusk was left. The current precentor is the Revd Peter Campion.\n* Chancellor: from 1218 to 2007, the chancellor held the prebend of [[Finglas]] (from the 1191 charter) and the churches of St Martin's (Dublin) and Killachegar, though the latter ceased by 1280. By 1280, St Martin's also no longer provided revenue but St Werburgh's replaced it. The current chancellor is the Revd Niall Sloane.\n* Treasurer: this office originally held the church of Clonkene and the prebend of [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St Audoen's]] (Dublin), as well as the rectory of St Mary's near Dublin Castle. Ballymore-Eustace later replaced Clonkene, and part of Lusk, St Audoen's. The current treasurer is H. E. Finlay, Canon of Windsor (Royal Peculiar, UK).\n* [[Taney Parish|Taney]]: this prebend, relating to an ancient rural diocese, originated with the 1191 charter, was given to the Archdeacon of Dublin about 1275 and became independent in 1883 when the office of Archdeacon of Dublin ceased to hold a place in the chapter. The current Prebendary of Taney is the Venerable R. W. Carney, Archdeacon of Killaloe and Clonfert.\n* [[Newcastle, County Dublin]]: this is a prebend since at least 1227 and was held by the Archdeacon of Glendalough from 1467 to 1872, when that archdeacon ceased to be a member of the chapter. The current Prebendary of Newcastle is the Revd I. M.

Prebendary of Wicklow as at September 2011 is the Revd S. E. Doogan, Incumbent of Ballyholme (Down).\n* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).\n* Mulhuddart: [[Mulhuddart]] has a history intertwined with the prebend of [[Castleknock]], the two having been designated from at least 1230.

Mullen, dean's vicar .\n* Monmohenock: originally part of the \"Economy Estate\" which supported cathedral operations, this became a lay-appointed prebend but was a regular prebend by circa 1227. The Prebendary of Monmohenock is the Revd T. C. Kinehan, Rector of Helen's Bay (Down).\n* Tipperkevin: Tipperkevin actually comprised two prebendaries from the early 14th century to circa 1600, lying in the remote parts of County Dublin later separate from the main county, between Kildare and Wicklow. As at September 2011, the Prebendary of Tipperkevin is the Revd R. Warren, Rector of Taney Parish (Dublin).\n* Donaghmore: this was a prebend from at least 1267. The Prebendary of Donaghmore as at September 2011 is the Revd E. R. G. West, Rector of Carnteel (Armagh).\n* Stagonil: named as a prebend in the Papal Bull of Celestine III, this does not seem to have functioned independently until 1303. The Prebendary of Stagonil as at December 2015 is the Revd P.A. Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).\n* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.\n* [[Clondalkin]]: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland\n* [[Finglas]]: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Revd Kiaran O'Mahony OSA.\n\n===Ecumenical canons===\nAs noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick's appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[File:Doorreconciliation.jpg|thumb|The Door of Reconciliation, through a hole in which the earls of Kildare and Ormond shook hands in 1492.]]\nThe cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see.<ref name=\"opening-times\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/Opening_Times.aspx | title=St Patrick's Cathedral \u2013 Opening Times and Prices | publisher=St Patrick's Cathedral | accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The Cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.\n\nLegend has it that Saint Patrick's was the place where the expression \"[[chancing your arm]]\" (meaning to take a risk) originated, when [[Gerald M\u00f3r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the [[Butler\u2013FitzGerald dispute]] with James, Earl of Ormond in 1492.\n\nIt was outside St Patrick's that the troops of the Jacob's Garrison assembled after the [[Easter Rising]] to march to [[Richmond Barracks]] where their leader [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and his sub-officers [[John MacBride]] and [[Michael O'Hanrahan]] were condemned to death and moved to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] to be shot.\n\n===Burials===\nOver 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral's floor and in the graveyard outside. \nSome notable individuals include:\n[[File:The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Wheatly Tomb, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin]]\n*[[Richard Northalis]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[John de Sandford]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n* [[Hugh Inge]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]]\n*[[Marcus Beresford (bishop)|Marcus Beresford]]\n* Sir [[John Blennerhassett (judge)|John Blennerhassett]] and his wife\n*[[Thomas Jones (archbishop)|Thomas Jones]] as well as his wife\n*[[Michael Boyle (the younger)|Michael Boyle]]\n*[[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Richard Meredith]]\n*[[Michael Tregury]], Archbishop of Dublin (1450\u20131471)\n*[[Adam Loftus (archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], also the first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] \u2013 in a family vault also containing his wife and two of their children\n*[[John Cradock]], Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772\u20131778)\n* [[Frederick Schomberg]], 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6-1690)\n*[[Jonathan Swift]], author and dean of the cathedral and [[Esther Johnson]] (\"Stella\") his companion of many years.\n*Sir [[Jerome Alexander]] (died 1670), a notoriously severe judge\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 3rd Earl of Ardglass]]\n*[[Lennox Robinson]], Playwright and Director\n\n===Choir school and grammar school===\n[[File:Yoke.JPG|thumb|right|The current [[organ console]]]]\n\nThe choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls' Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick's Grammar School, which provides a secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receive payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months' holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.\n\n===Organ===\nThe organ of St Patrick's Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes. Parts of it date from a [[Renatus Harris]] instrument of 1695.<ref>\"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]\" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p79: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> The organ was rebuilt in the 1890s by Henry Willis and Son, in consultation with Sir George Martin.

For the 1998 direct-to-video picture ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', Grandmama was played by [[Alice Ghostley]].\n\n===In other media===\nIn the 1989 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[Fester's Quest]]'', the instruction booklet says Grandmama's psychic powers foretold the alien invasion that would come and abduct all the people in the city, so she invokes a curse on the family mansion. As a result, when extraterrestrial scouts scan the Addams residence for life forms they find none, thanks to Grandmama's curse.\n\nGrandmama was played by [[Jackie Hoffman]] in the 2010 [[The Addams Family (musical)|Broadway musical]], in which her relation to the family in the storyline is ambiguous.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Addams Family}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938]]\n[[Category:Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:The Addams Family characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional fortune tellers]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in film]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Comics about magic]]\n[[Category:Fictional witches]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c5:fd80:ee01:ccba:197e:c288:d56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmama_(The_Addams_Family)"}

It was in 1890 that the colors buff and blue officially became Punahou's school colors depicting the hues of the sand and the sea. Back in 1890, long before the development of high-rises and hotels in Waikiki, all that was visible in the distance from the top of Punahou's campus was the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach which is probably why the colors buff and blue were chosen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hawaii|Schools}}\n* [[List of Punahou School alumni]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* A.

W. Bush]]; to centrist [[Ray Schoenke]] ('59*), a former Democratic candidate for Maryland Governor who founded the [[American Hunters and Shooters Association]] (an alternative to the [[National Rifle Association]]); to [[Jerry Berman]] ('58), chief counsel of the [[ACLU]].\n\nEllery Chun ('27) invented the [[Aloha Shirt]].\n\n==Punahou in fiction and literature==\n\n* \"He started his scholarly investigation while still at Punahou, although he later took his B.A. at Yale, his M.A. at Harvard, his Ph.D. from Oxford and his D.Litt. from the Sorbonne.  He received honorary degrees from eleven major universities, but when he died in 1914 the Honolulu ''Mail'' announced simply: 'The great scholar was educated at Punahou.'  None of the rest really mattered.\"  (Michener, ''Hawaii'')\n* \"Gramps grabbed me by the arm.  'Hell, Bar,' he whispered, 'this isn't a school.  This is heaven.'\" (Obama, ''Dreams from My Father'')\n* \"... I wanted a station wagon like the family in ''The Brady Bunch.''  I wanted to go steady with someone like Marcia or Jan, girls who dressed mod and spoke cool. My new school was full of girls like Marcia and Jan.  I'd just started seventh grade at Punahou ... .\"  (Wright, ''Punahou Blues'')\n* In the ''Descendants,'' Matt (George Clooney's character) accuses Sid of being \"a hundred miles away from Smartville.\"  Sid responds that he is \"Vice President of the Punahou chess club.\"  \n* In the current ''Hawaii Five O'' TV series, Charlie Fong, the \"extremely capable lab technician\" is revealed to be a Punahou graduate.\n* \"As part of chapel every year, the school held a special memorial day ceremony.  ... The JROTC cadets dressed in full gear and stood at attention the whole time.  Arm in arm, a boy and girl from each grade level ... walked slowly down the aisle with a wreath of flowers ... while the names of all of those in the Punahou family, former students of the school who had been killed in war, were read off. ... By the end, the entire floor at the front of the chapel was filled with flowers.\" (Lum, ''Letting Go'')\n* \"We had attended high school together at Punahou, the most exclusive private school in Hawaii.\"  (Charley Memminger in ''Aloha, Lady Blue'')\n* \"'What do people do here in the evening? The movies?' 'Just at present,' the girl told him, 'everybody visits Punahou ... to see the night-blooming cereus. It's the season now, you know.'\" (Biggers, ''House Without a Key'')\n\n==Alma Mater==\n[[File:Punahou School Carnival.jpg|thumb|right|225px|School carnival in 2007]]\n\nO\u02bbahu A\n\nO\u02bbahu a, O\u02bbahu a<br/>Punahou, our Punahou;<br/>\nMau a Mau, oh mau a mau,<br/>\nPunahou, our Punahou.\n\nThroughout the years we've shown our light,<br/>\nWe glory in O\u02bbahu's might;<br/>\nThe Buff and Blue's a glorious sight,<br/>\nPunahou, our Punahou.<br/>\n\nThe song is sung to the tune of ''[[Maryland, My Maryland]]'' also known as \"O Tannenbaum\". The spelling is from the original words to \"Oahu A\" written in 1902 by a student.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===School shout===\n<blockquote><poem>Ready? Hit it!\nStrawberry Shortcake, Huckleberry Pie\nV-I-C-T-O-R-Y\nAre We In It? Well I Guess!\nPunahou, Punahou, Yes, Yes, Yes!</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis cheer is typically shouted by the marching band and cheerleaders at Punahou, at events such as football games and other sports activities and gatherings following the alma mater.\n\n===School mascot===\nPunahou does not have an official mascot. The symbol that perhaps most closely qualifies as a school mascot is the [[Pandanus tectorius|hala tree]], whose image is used in the school's seal. Fans often refer to athletic teams as the \"Sons of Oahu\", or \"Buff & Blue\". It was in 1890 that the colors buff and blue officially became Punahou's school colors depicting the hues of the sand and the sea. Back in 1890, long before the development of high-rises and hotels in Waikiki, all that was visible in the distance from the top of Punahou's campus was the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach which is probably why the colors buff and blue were chosen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hawaii|Schools}}\n* [[List of Punahou School alumni]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* A.

The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|television series]], Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by \"[[mortician]]\". Morticia's maiden name is \"Frump\" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by [[Carolyn Jones]]). In the television series, her mother (Uncle Fester's sister) was named Hester Frump (played by [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]). Her mother-in-law is [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]]. In the 1990s Addams Family films, familial relationships are changed for the characters of Grandmama and Fester.

In one episode she is seen wearing a black pointed hat. She commonly wears black [[hobble dress]]es to match her hair, tightly form fitting, with a fringe of octopus-like cloth \"tentacles\" at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies [[baking powder]] to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking [[French language|French]] (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese [[shamisen]]. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]], and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt.
