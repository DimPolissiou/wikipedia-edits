It is now largely [[archaism|archaic]], having been replaced in most contexts by ''[[you]]''. It is used in parts of Northern [[England]] and in [[Modern Scots|Scots]] ({{IPA|/\u00f0u/}}), and also in rural parts of [[Newfoundland]], albeit as a recessive feature.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Sandra |date=2010 |title=Newfoundland and Labrador English |location=Scotland |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=89|isbn=9780748631414 }}</ref> ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is '''''thee''''' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), the [[genitive|possessive]] is '''''thy''''' (adjective) or '''''thine''''' (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] is '''''thyself'''''. When ''thou'' is the [[grammatical subject]] of a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]], the verb form typically ends in ''-(e)st'' (e.g., \"thou goest\"; \"thou do(e)st\"), but in some cases just ''-t'' (e.g., \"thou art\"; \"thou shalt\"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in ''-s'', hence the [[Quaker]] habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with \"thee\" as the subject (paralleling the usage of \"you\").\n\nOriginally, ''thou'' was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'', derived from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|ancient Indo-European]] root. In [[Middle English]], ''thou'' was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small \"u\" over the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]]: \u00fe\u0367. Starting in the 1300s, ''thou'' was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, ''you'', the oblique/objective form of ''ye'', was used for formal circumstances (see [[T\u2013V distinction]]).<ref name=\"MED\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=y\u01d2u (pron.) |encyclopedia= Middle English Dictionary |date= |year=2014 |publisher=the Regents of the University of Michigan |location= |id= |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&id=MED54032 |access-date=10 May 2018}}</ref> In the 17th century, ''thou'' fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]],<ref>Shorrocks, 433\u2013438.</ref> as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.\n\nEarly English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to [[God]] in [[French language|French]] (in [[Protestantism in France|Protestantism]] both in past and present, in [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholicism]] since the post-[[Vatican II]] reforms), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and many others (all of which maintain the use of an \"informal\" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] between singular and plural second-person pronouns and verb forms, so they used ''thou'', ''thee'', ''thy'', and ''thine'' for singular, and ''ye'', ''you'', ''your'', and ''yours'' for plural.\n\nIn standard [[modern English]], ''thou'' continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language, and in certain fixed phrases such as \"[[wikt:fare thee well|fare thee well]]\". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of ''thou'' and ''ye'' through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as ''[[yinz]]'', ''yous''<ref>{{Cite book |title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM |last = Kortmann |first = Bernd |publisher = Mouton de Gruyter |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-3110175325 |location = |page = 1117}}</ref> and ''[[y'all]]'' or the colloquial ''you guys''.

(This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -e\u00fe, Russian, \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442, ''znayet'', he knoweth, Latin ''amat'' he loveth.) The {{according to whom|anomalous development|date= February 2020}} from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related [[German language|German]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the [[consonant]] of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du \u2192 liebstu \u2192 liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fennell |first=Barbara A.|title=A history of English: a sociolinguistic approach. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm |title=Frisian (Frysk/Friisk/Seeltersk) |website=Omniglot}}</ref>\n\n==== Comparison ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left\"\n !

English ''you people, you guys'').\n\nIn the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Grammatical mood#Imperative|imperative moods]], the ending in ''-(e)st'' is dropped (although it is generally retained in ''thou wert'', the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb \"to be\"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after \"if\" and the poetic \"and\".\n\n:If thou be Johan, I tell it thee, right with a good advice ...;<ref>Middle English carol:\nIf thou be Johan, I tell it the<br />Ryght with a good aduyce<br />Thou may be glad Johan to be<br />It is a name of pryce.<br /></ref>\n:Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart ...<ref>Eleanor Hull, ''[[Be Thou My Vision]]'', 1912 translation of traditional Irish hymn, ''Rob tu mo bhoile, a Comdi cride''.</ref>\n:I do wish thou wert a dog, that I might love thee something ...<ref>Shakespeare, ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', act IV, scene 3.</ref>\n:And thou bring Alexander and his paramour before the Emperor, I'll be Actaeon ...<ref>[[Christopher Marlowe]], ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Dr. Faustus]]'', act IV, scene 2.</ref>\n:O WERT thou in the cauld blast, ... I'd shelter thee ...<ref>[[Robert Burns]], ''O Wert Thou in the Cauld Blast''(song), lines 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn modern regional English dialects that use ''thou'' or some variant, such as in [[Yorkshire dialect#Vocabulary and grammar|Yorkshire]], it often takes the third person form of the verb ''-s''. This comes from a merging of [[Early Modern English]] second person singular ending ''-st'' and third person singular ending ''-s'' into ''-s'' (the latter a southern [[isogloss|variation]] of ''[[Thorn (letter)|-\u00fe]]'' (''-th'')).\n\nThe present [[indicative]] form ''art'' (\"''\u00feu eart''\") goes back to [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] Old English (see [[OED]] ''s.v. be'' IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (''e.g.'' in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from [[Danelaw|the North]], ''cf.'' [[History of the Icelandic language#The Scandinavian period (550\u20131050)|Icelandic]] ''\u00fe\u00fa ert''. For its ultimate origin, see OED ''be'', etymology section i.\u03b5/\u03b6.

A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.<ref>Entries for ''thou'' and *''tu'', in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Old and Middle English===\n[[File:Adam and Eve, thou abbrev.jpg|thumb|right|''\u00fe<sup>u</sup>'', abbreviation for ''thou'', from ''Adam and Eve'', from a ca. 1415 manuscript, England]]\nIn [[Old English]], ''thou'' was governed by a simple rule: ''thou'' addressed one person, and ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' more than one. Beginning in the 1300s ''thou'' was gradually replaced by the plural ''ye'' as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, ''thou'' remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.<ref name=\"MED\"/>\n\nThe practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the [[T\u2013V distinction]] and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing [[monarch|kings]] and other [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] in the [[plural]]. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, ''tu'' was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form ''vous'' was reserved and formal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===General decline in Early Modern English===\nFairly suddenly in the 17th century, ''thou'' began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] farther from London,<ref>Shorrocks, 433\u2013438.</ref> as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of ''thou'' in the 17th century include the increasing identification of ''you'' with \"polite society\" and the uncertainty of using ''thou'' for inferiors versus ''you'' for superiors (with ''you'' being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.<ref>Nordquist, Richard (2016). \"[https://www.thoughtco.com/notes-on-second-person-pronouns-1692677 Notes on Second-Person Pronouns: Whatever Happened to 'Thou' and 'Thee'?]\" ''ThoughtCo''. About, Inc.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''A Grammar of the English Tongue'', wrote: \"in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular\", implying that ''thou'' was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while ''you'' could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] (specifically, [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire), where the usage of ''thou'' persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of [[Southern English English|southern British English]], ''thou'' had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650.<ref>Entry for ''thou'' in ''[[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]''.</ref> ''Thou'' persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T\u2013V distinction.\n\nOne notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns ''thou'', ''thy'', and ''thee'' is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of [[Early Modern English]] texts, such as many character interactions in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use ''thou'' (rather than ''you'') when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.<ref>Atkins, Carl D. (ed.) (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8buSTBjFyUC&q=%22thou...was...the+pronoun%22 Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary]''. Associated University Presses. p. 55.</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n===Use as a verb===\nMany European languages contain verbs meaning \"to address with the informal pronoun\", such as German ''duzen'', the Norwegian noun ''dus'' refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French ''tutoyer'', Spanish ''tutear'', Swedish ''dua'', Dutch ''jijen en jouen'', Russian ''\u0442\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c (tykat')'', Polish ''tyka\u0107'', Romanian ''tutui'', Hungarian ''tegezni'', Finnish ''sinutella'', etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1603, when Sir [[Edward Coke]], prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to [[insult]] Raleigh by saying,\n\n:''I thou thee, thou traitor!''<ref>Reported, among many other places, in [[H. L. Mencken]], ''[[The American Language]]'' (1921), ch. 9, ss. 4., [http://www.bartleby.com/185/41.html \"The pronoun\"].</ref>\n::In modern English: ''I \"thou\" you, you traitor!''\n\nhere using ''thou'' as a verb meaning ''to call (someone) \"thou\" or \"thee\"''. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in [[Yorkshire dialect]] for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:\n\n:''Don't thee tha them as thas thee!'' \n::In modern English: ''Don't \"thee\" (you) those who \"thee\" you!''\n::In other words:  ''Don't use the familiar form \"thee\" towards those who refer to you as \"thee\".'' (\"tha\" being the local dialectal variant of \"thou\")\n\nAnd similar in [[Lancashire dialect]]:\n\n:''Don't thee me, thee; I's you to thee!''\n::In standard English: ''Don't \"thee\" me, you! I'm \"you\" to you!''\n\nSee further the [[wikt:thou#Verb| Wiktionary page on ''thou'' as a verb]].\n\n===Religious uses===\nAs [[William Tyndale]] [[Tyndale Bible|translated the Bible]] into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] originals. He used ''thou'' for the singular and ''ye'' for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the [[addressee]]. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier [[Wycliffe's Bible]] and the later [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. But as the use of ''thou'' in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jespersen|first1=Otto|authorlink1=Otto Jespersen|title=Progress in Language|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026448203#page/n279/mode/2up|year=1894|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|page=260}}</ref> its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.<ref>David Daniell, ''William Tyndale: A Biography''.

The Church of England. Retrieved on 12 September 2007.</ref>\n\n[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] formerly used ''thee'' as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying ''thee'' for both nominative and accusative cases.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.bartelby.net/248/456.html ''The Quaker Widow''] by [[Bayard Taylor]]</ref> This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by [[George Fox]], who called it \"plain speaking\", as an attempt to preserve the [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] familiarity associated with the pronoun.

In Diana Ross's song \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" (written by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]]) we hear the lyric \"Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'.\" These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of \"Upside Down\", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. \n\nMost modern writers have no experience using ''thou'' in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional [[Grammatical conjugation|verb forms]]. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending ''-eth'' with ''thou'', for example ''thou thinketh''. The converse\u2014the use of the second person singular ending ''-est'' for the third person\u2014also occurs (\"So sayest Thor!\"\u2015spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern [[parody]] and [[pastiche]]<ref>See, for example, [[Rob Liefeld]], \"Awaken the Thunder\" (Marvel Comics, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', vol. 2, issue 1, cover date Nov. 1996, part of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline.)</ref> in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are often transposed.\n\nIn the fictional teenage [[argot]] [[nadsat]], invented for [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]]), [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] and his ''droogs'' regularly use \"thou\", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of \"you\" and \"thou\" for the second person):\n\n:''Well if it isn't fat stinking billygoat Billyboy in poison!

This practice has largely fallen out of use. [[Ernest Hemingway]], in his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', uses the forms \"thou\" and \"you\" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the [[Spanish language]] in which both formal (''usted'') and familiar (''t\u00fa'') second-person pronouns still exist.\n\nIn reading passages with ''thou'' and ''thee'', many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the ''e'' in ''-est'' ought to be unstressed, and ''thou'' and ''thee'' should be no more stressed than ''you''.\n\n==Current usage==\n''You'' is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, ''thou'' has persisted,<ref name=\"northern_england\">{{cite journal | title='You' and 'Thou' in Northern England | first=William | last=Evans | journal=South Atlantic Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=4 |date=November 1969 | pages=17\u201321 | doi=10.2307/3196963 | publisher=South Atlantic Modern Language Association | jstor=3196963}}</ref> and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as ''[[y'all]]'' in the [[Southern United States]] or ''[[yous]]'' by some Australians. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.<ref>{{cite book\n | title=From Elfland to Poughkeepsie\n | author=Le Guin, Ursula K.\n | authorlink = Ursula K.

The word ''thee'' is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the [[Dawley]] area of [[Telford]] and referred to as the Dawley dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telford-live.com/2012/10/the-dawley-dictionary/ |title=The Dawley Dictionary|first=Pete|last=Jackson|publisher=Telford Live|date=October 14, 2012}}</ref> Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The possessive is often written as ''thy'' in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed ''tha'', and the possessive form of ''tha'' has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming ''yours'' or the local{{Specify|date=September 2008}} word ''your'n'' (from ''your one''):{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"width:90%; margin:0 auto 0 auto;\"\n!\n||\n!Nominative\n!Objective\n!Genitive\n!Possessive\n|-\n!2nd Person\n||''singular''\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|tha\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|thee\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|thy (tha)\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|yours / your'n\n|}\n\nThe apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and [[genitive]] forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing ''tha'' to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.\n\nSome other variants are specific to certain areas. In [[Sheffield]], the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the \"dee-dahs\" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, ''ta'' was used as an unstressed shortening of ''thou'', which can be found in the song \"[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]\". These variants are no longer in use.\n\nIn rural North [[Lancashire]] between Lancaster and the [[North Yorkshire]] border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as \"What would ''tha'' like for ''thi'' tea?\" (What would you like for your dinner), and {{\"'}}appen ''tha'' waint\" (\"perhaps you won't\"{{spaced ndash}}'''happen''' being the [[dialect]] word for '''perhaps''') and \"tha knows\" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.\n\nThe use of the word \"thee\" in the hit song \"[[I Predict a Riot]]\" by [[Leeds]] band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] (\"Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee\") caused some comment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml |title=BBC ''Top of the Pops'' web page |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-03-18|archivedate=2010-06-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618075108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml}}</ref> by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]].\n\nThe use of the phrase \"tha knows\" has been widely used in various songs by [[Arctic Monkeys]], a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield.

It is now largely [[archaism|archaic]], having been replaced in most contexts by ''[[you]]''. It is used in parts of Northern [[England]] and in [[Modern Scots|Scots]] ({{IPA|/\u00f0u/}}), and also in rural parts of [[Newfoundland]], albeit as a recessive feature.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Sandra |date=2010 |title=Newfoundland and Labrador English |location=Scotland |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=89|isbn=9780748631414 }}</ref> ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is '''''thee''''' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), the [[genitive|possessive]] is '''''thy''''' (adjective) or '''''thine''''' (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] is '''''thyself'''''. When ''thou'' is the [[grammatical subject]] of a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]], the verb form typically ends in ''-(e)st'' (e.g., \"thou goest\"; \"thou do(e)st\"), but in some cases just ''-t'' (e.g., \"thou art\"; \"thou shalt\"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in ''-s'', hence the [[Quaker]] habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with \"thee\" as the subject (paralleling the usage of \"you\").\n\nOriginally, ''thou'' was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'', derived from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|ancient Indo-European]] root. In [[Middle English]], ''thou'' was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small \"u\" over the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]]: \u00fe\u0367. Starting in the 1300s, ''thou'' was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, ''you'', the oblique/objective form of ''ye'', was used for formal circumstances (see [[T\u2013V distinction]]).<ref name=\"MED\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=y\u01d2u (pron.) |encyclopedia= Middle English Dictionary |date= |year=2014 |publisher=the Regents of the University of Michigan |location= |id= |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&id=MED54032 |access-date=10 May 2018}}</ref> In the 17th century, ''thou'' fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]],<ref>Shorrocks, 433\u2013438.</ref> as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.\n\nEarly English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to [[God]] in [[French language|French]] (in [[Protestantism in France|Protestantism]] both in past and present, in [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholicism]] since the post-[[Vatican II]] reforms), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and many others (all of which maintain the use of an \"informal\" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] between singular and plural second-person pronouns and verb forms, so they used ''thou'', ''thee'', ''thy'', and ''thine'' for singular, and ''ye'', ''you'', ''your'', and ''yours'' for plural.\n\nIn standard [[modern English]], ''thou'' continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language, and in certain fixed phrases such as \"[[wikt:fare thee well|fare thee well]]\". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of ''thou'' and ''ye'' through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as ''[[yinz]]'', ''yous''<ref>{{Cite book |title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM |last = Kortmann |first = Bernd |publisher = Mouton de Gruyter |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-3110175325 |location = |page = 1117}}</ref> and ''[[y'all]]'' or the colloquial ''you guys''.

The {{according to whom|anomalous development|date= February 2020}} from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related [[German language|German]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the [[consonant]] of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du \u2192 liebstu \u2192 liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fennell |first=Barbara A.|title=A history of English: a sociolinguistic approach. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm |title=Frisian (Frysk/Friisk/Seeltersk) |website=Omniglot}}</ref>\n\n==== Comparison ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left\"\n !

English ''you people, you guys'').\n\nIn the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Grammatical mood#Imperative|imperative moods]], the ending in ''-(e)st'' is dropped (although it is generally retained in ''thou wert'', the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb \"to be\"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after \"if\" and the poetic \"and\".\n\n:If thou be Johan, I tell it thee, right with a good advice ...;<ref>Middle English carol:\nIf thou be Johan, I tell it the<br />Ryght with a good aduyce<br />Thou may be glad Johan to be<br />It is a name of pryce.<br /></ref>\n:Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart ...<ref>Eleanor Hull, ''[[Be Thou My Vision]]'', 1912 translation of traditional Irish hymn, ''Rob tu mo bhoile, a Comdi cride''.</ref>\n:I do wish thou wert a dog, that I might love thee something ...<ref>Shakespeare, ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', act IV, scene 3.</ref>\n:And thou bring Alexander and his paramour before the Emperor, I'll be Actaeon ...<ref>[[Christopher Marlowe]], ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Dr. Faustus]]'', act IV, scene 2.</ref>\n:O WERT thou in the cauld blast, ...

This comes from a merging of [[Early Modern English]] second person singular ending ''-st'' and third person singular ending ''-s'' into ''-s'' (the latter a southern [[isogloss|variation]] of ''[[Thorn (letter)|-\u00fe]]'' (''-th'')).\n\nThe present [[indicative]] form ''art'' (\"''\u00feu eart''\") goes back to [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] Old English (see [[OED]] ''s.v. be'' IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (''e.g.'' in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from [[Danelaw|the North]], ''cf.'' [[History of the Icelandic language#The Scandinavian period (550\u20131050)|Icelandic]] ''\u00fe\u00fa ert''. For its ultimate origin, see OED ''be'', etymology section i.\u03b5/\u03b6. The preterite indicative of ''be'' is generally ''thou wast''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Thou'' originates from [[Old English language|Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u016b}}, and ultimately via [[Grimm's law]] from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''tu'', with the expected [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[vowel]] lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an [[open syllable]].

A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.<ref>Entries for ''thou'' and *''tu'', in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Old and Middle English===\n[[File:Adam and Eve, thou abbrev.jpg|thumb|right|''\u00fe<sup>u</sup>'', abbreviation for ''thou'', from ''Adam and Eve'', from a ca. 1415 manuscript, England]]\nIn [[Old English]], ''thou'' was governed by a simple rule: ''thou'' addressed one person, and ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' more than one. Beginning in the 1300s ''thou'' was gradually replaced by the plural ''ye'' as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, ''thou'' remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.<ref name=\"MED\"/>\n\nThe practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the [[T\u2013V distinction]] and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing [[monarch|kings]] and other [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] in the [[plural]]. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, ''tu'' was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form ''vous'' was reserved and formal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===General decline in Early Modern English===\nFairly suddenly in the 17th century, ''thou'' began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] farther from London,<ref>Shorrocks, 433\u2013438.</ref> as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of ''thou'' in the 17th century include the increasing identification of ''you'' with \"polite society\" and the uncertainty of using ''thou'' for inferiors versus ''you'' for superiors (with ''you'' being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.<ref>Nordquist, Richard (2016). \"[https://www.thoughtco.com/notes-on-second-person-pronouns-1692677 Notes on Second-Person Pronouns: Whatever Happened to 'Thou' and 'Thee'?]\" ''ThoughtCo''. About, Inc.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''A Grammar of the English Tongue'', wrote: \"in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular\", implying that ''thou'' was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while ''you'' could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] (specifically, [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire), where the usage of ''thou'' persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of [[Southern English English|southern British English]], ''thou'' had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650.<ref>Entry for ''thou'' in ''[[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]''.</ref> ''Thou'' persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T\u2013V distinction.\n\nOne notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns ''thou'', ''thy'', and ''thee'' is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of [[Early Modern English]] texts, such as many character interactions in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use ''thou'' (rather than ''you'') when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.<ref>Atkins, Carl D. (ed.) (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8buSTBjFyUC&q=%22thou...was...the+pronoun%22 Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary]''. Associated University Presses. p. 55.</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n===Use as a verb===\nMany European languages contain verbs meaning \"to address with the informal pronoun\", such as German ''duzen'', the Norwegian noun ''dus'' refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French ''tutoyer'', Spanish ''tutear'', Swedish ''dua'', Dutch ''jijen en jouen'', Russian ''\u0442\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c (tykat')'', Polish ''tyka\u0107'', Romanian ''tutui'', Hungarian ''tegezni'', Finnish ''sinutella'', etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1603, when Sir [[Edward Coke]], prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to [[insult]] Raleigh by saying,\n\n:''I thou thee, thou traitor!''<ref>Reported, among many other places, in [[H. L. Mencken]], ''[[The American Language]]'' (1921), ch. 9, ss. 4., [http://www.bartleby.com/185/41.html \"The pronoun\"].</ref>\n::In modern English: ''I \"thou\" you, you traitor!''\n\nhere using ''thou'' as a verb meaning ''to call (someone) \"thou\" or \"thee\"''. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in [[Yorkshire dialect]] for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:\n\n:''Don't thee tha them as thas thee!'' \n::In modern English: ''Don't \"thee\" (you) those who \"thee\" you!''\n::In other words:  ''Don't use the familiar form \"thee\" towards those who refer to you as \"thee\".'' (\"tha\" being the local dialectal variant of \"thou\")\n\nAnd similar in [[Lancashire dialect]]:\n\n:''Don't thee me, thee; I's you to thee!''\n::In standard English: ''Don't \"thee\" me, you! I'm \"you\" to you!''\n\nSee further the [[wikt:thou#Verb| Wiktionary page on ''thou'' as a verb]].\n\n===Religious uses===\nAs [[William Tyndale]] [[Tyndale Bible|translated the Bible]] into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] originals. He used ''thou'' for the singular and ''ye'' for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the [[addressee]]. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier [[Wycliffe's Bible]] and the later [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. But as the use of ''thou'' in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jespersen|first1=Otto|authorlink1=Otto Jespersen|title=Progress in Language|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026448203#page/n279/mode/2up|year=1894|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|page=260}}</ref> its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.<ref>David Daniell, ''William Tyndale: A Biography''.

The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending ''-eth'' with ''thou'', for example ''thou thinketh''. The converse\u2014the use of the second person singular ending ''-est'' for the third person\u2014also occurs (\"So sayest Thor!\"\u2015spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern [[parody]] and [[pastiche]]<ref>See, for example, [[Rob Liefeld]], \"Awaken the Thunder\" (Marvel Comics, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', vol. 2, issue 1, cover date Nov. 1996, part of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline.)</ref> in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are often transposed.\n\nIn the fictional teenage [[argot]] [[nadsat]], invented for [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]]), [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] and his ''droogs'' regularly use \"thou\", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of \"you\" and \"thou\" for the second person):\n\n:''Well if it isn't fat stinking billygoat Billyboy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip-oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou!''<ref>{{Cite book | last = Burgess | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | title = A Clockwork Orange | publisher = William Heinemann | year = 1962 | page = 15 | isbn = 0-434-09800-0}}</ref>\n\nSome translators render the T\u2013V distinction in English with \"thou\" and \"you\", particularly in places where ''you'' appears in the place of expected ''thou'', or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. [[Ernest Hemingway]], in his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', uses the forms \"thou\" and \"you\" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the [[Spanish language]] in which both formal (''usted'') and familiar (''t\u00fa'') second-person pronouns still exist.\n\nIn reading passages with ''thou'' and ''thee'', many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the ''e'' in ''-est'' ought to be unstressed, and ''thou'' and ''thee'' should be no more stressed than ''you''.\n\n==Current usage==\n''You'' is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, \"thou\" has persisted,<ref name=\"northern_england\">{{cite journal | title='You' and 'Thou' in Northern England | first=William | last=Evans | journal=South Atlantic Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=4 |date=November 1969 | pages=17\u201321 | doi=10.2307/3196963 | publisher=South Atlantic Modern Language Association | jstor=3196963}}</ref> and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as [[y'all]] in the [[Southern United States]] or [[yous]] by some Australians. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.<ref>{{cite book\n | title=From Elfland to Poughkeepsie\n | author=Le Guin, Ursula K.\n | authorlink = Ursula K.

The word ''thee'' is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the [[Dawley]] area of [[Telford]] and referred to as the Dawley dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telford-live.com/2012/10/the-dawley-dictionary/ |title=The Dawley Dictionary|first=Pete|last=Jackson|publisher=Telford Live|date=October 14, 2012}}</ref> Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The possessive is often written as ''thy'' in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed ''tha'', and the possessive form of ''tha'' has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming ''yours'' or the local{{Specify|date=September 2008}} word ''your'n'' (from ''your one''):{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"width:90%; margin:0 auto 0 auto;\"\n!\n||\n!Nominative\n!Objective\n!Genitive\n!Possessive\n|-\n!2nd Person\n||''singular''\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|tha\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|thee\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|thy (tha)\n| style=\"background:#ccc;\"|yours / your'n\n|}\n\nThe apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and [[genitive]] forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing ''tha'' to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.\n\nSome other variants are specific to certain areas. In [[Sheffield]], the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the \"dee-dahs\" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, ''ta'' was used as an unstressed shortening of ''thou'', which can be found in the song \"[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]\". These variants are no longer in use.\n\nIn rural North [[Lancashire]] between Lancaster and the [[North Yorkshire]] border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as \"What would ''tha'' like for ''thi'' tea?\" (What would you like for your dinner), and {{\"'}}appen ''tha'' waint\" (\"perhaps you won't\"{{spaced ndash}}'''happen''' being the [[dialect]] word for '''perhaps''') and \"tha knows\" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.\n\nThe use of the word \"thee\" in the hit song \"[[I Predict a Riot]]\" by [[Leeds]] band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] (\"Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee\") caused some comment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml |title=BBC ''Top of the Pops'' web page |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-03-18|archivedate=2010-06-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618075108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml}}</ref> by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]].\n\nThe use of the phrase \"tha knows\" has been widely used in various songs by [[Arctic Monkeys]], a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with \"tha knows\" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.\n\nThe use persists somewhat in the [[West Country dialects]], albeit somewhat affected. Some of [[the Wurzels]] songs include \"Drink Up Thy [[Cider|Zider]]\" and \"Sniff Up Thy Snuff\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |title=Cider drinkers target core audience in Bristol |work=Bristol Evening Post |date=April 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405190846/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |archive-date=2010-04-05 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |postscript=,}} and [http://www.wurzelmania.co.uk/ Wurzelmania.] somersetmade ltd.

Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;

Men's World Cup]\n}}\n\nThe '''FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup''' is an international [[volleyball]] competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball}}'' ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]), the sport's global governing body. Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, except for 1973 when no tournament was held, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], which won its third title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by six different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout this article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> have won six times (four as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Cup winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] with 3 titles; [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] with 2 titles; and [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] and [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winners a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\n[[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] (considered as the inheritors of the records of the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] are the only teams that have won the Men's World Cup more than once.\n\nThe Soviets took the gold at the opening edition of the tournament, in 1965. Four years later, the winner was also a socialist nation, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]].\n\nScheduled for [[Uruguay]], the 1973 edition was cancelled. In 1977, competition was resumed in Japan, and the Soviet Union came back for two wins in a row. In 1985, they were once again runners-up, but lost the decisive match to United States in five sets. In 1989, [[Cuba men's national volleyball team|Cuba]] surprised the world and beat a rising [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] to take the gold.\n\nWith the competition now set as a qualifying event for the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union, led by Dmitri Fomin won the title in 1991, at the brink of dissolution. The Italians, who hadn't participated in this edition, finally conquered their gold medal in 1995. Inheriting a large part of the former Soviet volleyball programme, Russia were the winners in 1999.\n\nThe following two editions, played in 2003 and 2007 respectively, were won by favorites Brazil. In 2011, Russia regained the title, while the 2015 edition was won by the United States for the second time. Brazil won the title for the third time in 2019.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*Top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%;

Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C. United]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] to decide the champion of the [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996 season]].\n\nBoth finalists finished in the top two spots of their respective conferences, with D.C. placing second in the East and Los Angeles atop the West. The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.
