After working as a schoolteacher for several years, he became a school administrator, serving as a principal and, later, district superintendent. Evers first ran for Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1993 and again in 2001, losing both elections.

He was reelected twice, in 2013 and 2017.\n\nOn August 23, 2017, Evers announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin, challenging two-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]. Walker was seen as a vulnerable incumbent and had been criticized for his education policies. Evers won the Democratic primary in August 2018. Former [[Wisconsin State Assembly|state representative]] [[Mandela Barnes]] won the primary for [[Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin|lieutenant governor]], becoming Evers's running mate.

The elder Ellerker took part in the useless Spanish expedition in 1512, was an esquire of the king's body, received a salary as one of the king's spears of honour, and died in 1540. Both father and son were knighted in 1513 by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] at [[Flodden Field]]. Whether it was he or his son who represented [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] in the parliament of 1529 is uncertain.\n\nThe younger Ellerker was introduced to the court and demonstrated his prowess at tournaments. He was one of the knights who accompanied Henry VIII to his meeting in 1520 with [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/ellerker-sir-ralph-1489-1546|title=ELLERKER, Sir Ralph (by 1489-1546), of Risby, Yorks.|publisher=History of Parliament Trust|accessdate= 3 August 2019}} </ref>\n\nHe was appointed chief steward of the lordships of Cotingham and Rise in 1522, and from that time onward frequently was on the commission of the peace for the [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]]. He was pricked [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] for 1529\u201330. He was on the royal commission to treat for redress of outrages in the west marches in 1531, when he also served on a commission for the reform of the weirs and fishgarths in Yorkshire. In 1533 he was busy in the north mustering troops and fighting, and in July of that year he was one of the English commissioners who concluded a year's truce with Scotland.\n\nHe was returned as knight of the shire for [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] for the parliament of 1542. In that year he was also head of a commission appointed to survey the waste grounds on the border, to describe the condition of 'all castells, towers, barmekins, and fortresses,' and to advise on the best means for strengthening the defences and peopling the district. The official report of this commission is preserved among the [[Harleian MSS]]. (292, ff. 97-123). In the same year Ellerker was one of the council at [[Calais]], and in 1544 he was marshal of the English army in [[Boulogne-Sur-Mer|Boulogne]] when that town was captured. He distinguished himself by taking the crest from the dauphin of France. He returned to England in January 1545\u20136, but in April was at Boulogne again, and died there in battle in that month.\n\nHe was buried in the church of St. Mary at Boulogne. He had married Joan, daughter of John or Thomas Arden, by whom he had a son, Ralph. Ralph was [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] in 1529, was knighted by [[Henry VIII]] for winning an ensign in France, but was killed by the French on 1 August 1550.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DNB|wstitle=Ellerker, Ralph}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ellerker, Ralph}}\n[[Category:1480s births]]\n[[Category:1546 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rowley, East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of England for constituencies in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:English knights]]\n[[Category:English military personnel killed in action]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1529\u20131536]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1542\u20131544]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Yorkshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|16th-century English politician}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''Sir Ralph Ellerker''' (died 1546) of Risby, Yorkshire was an English soldier, knight and Member of Parliament.\n\nEllerker was the eldest son of Sir Ralph Ellerker of [[Risby, Yorkshire]], by Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Gower of [[Stittenham]]. The elder Ellerker took part in the useless Spanish expedition in 1512, was an esquire of the king's body, received a salary as one of the king's spears of honour, and died in 1540. Both father and son were knighted in 1513 by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] at [[Flodden Field]]. Whether it was he or his son who represented [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] in the parliament of 1529 is uncertain.\n\nThe younger Ellerker was introduced to the court and demonstrated his prowess at tournaments. He was one of the knights who accompanied Henry VIII to his meeting in 1520 with [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/ellerker-sir-ralph-1489-1546|title=ELLERKER, Sir Ralph (by 1489-1546), of Risby, Yorks.|publisher=History of Parliament Trust|accessdate= 3 August 2019}} </ref>\n\nHe was appointed chief steward of the lordships of Cotingham and Rise in 1522, and from that time onward frequently was on the commission of the peace for the [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]]. He was pricked [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] for 1529\u201330. He was on the royal commission to treat for redress of outrages in the west marches in 1531, when he also served on a commission for the reform of the weirs and fishgarths in Yorkshire. In 1533 he was busy in the north mustering troops and fighting, and in July of that year he was one of the English commissioners who concluded a year's truce with Scotland.\n\nHe was returned as knight of the shire for [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] for the parliament of 1542. In that year he was also head of a commission appointed to survey the waste grounds on the border, to describe the condition of 'all castells, towers, barmekins, and fortresses,' and to advise on the best means for strengthening the defences and peopling the district. The official report of this commission is preserved among the [[Harleian MSS]]. (292, ff. 97-123). In the same year Ellerker was one of the council at [[Calais]], and in 1544 he was marshal of the English army in [[Boulogne-Sur-Mer|Boulogne]] when that town was captured. He distinguished himself by taking the crest from the dauphin of France. He returned to England in January 1545-6, but in April was at Boulogne again, and died there in battle in that month.\n\nHe was buried in the church of St. Mary at Boulogne. He had married Joan, daughter of John or Thomas Arden, by whom he had a son, Ralph. Ralph was [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] in 1529, was knighted by [[Henry VIII]] for winning an ensign in France, but was killed by the French on 1 August 1550.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DNB|wstitle=Ellerker, Ralph}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ellerker, Ralph}}\n[[Category:1480s births]]\n[[Category:1546 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rowley, East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of England for constituencies in Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:English knights]]\n[[Category:English military personnel killed in action]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1529\u20131536]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1542\u20131544]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Yorkshire]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1545-6 \u2192 1545\u20136", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Ellerker"}
