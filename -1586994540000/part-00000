An architectural competition to design a permanent church, that of St Albans in Beacon Hill, was held in 1906, and John Duke Coleridge (1879&ndash;1934) was chosen as the architect. The first phase, comprising the chancel, north chapel, transept and the lower stage of a projected bell tower, was completed by 1907, and the church gained its own parish in the same year. A series of windows by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designers [[Karl Parsons]] and [[Christopher Whall]] were installed in the unfinished church between 1908 and 1912. The three eastern bays of the nave were consecrated in 1915, but the two western bays were not built until 1929&ndash;31; the bell-tower was never completed and became in effect a south transept. There followed two additional [[stained-glass]] windows: by Christopher Webb in 1945 and by [[Francis Skeat]] in 1950. A large vestry extension was added in 1964. A fire in 1999 destroyed the original high altar and [[reredos]] paintings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cormack|first=Peter|title=Karl Parsons, 1884-1934: Stained Glass Artist - Exhibition Catalogue|year=1987|publisher=William Morris Gallery|location=London|isbn=9780901974259|pages=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Sir Nikolaus|title=The Buildings of England: Surrey|year=1982|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:UndershawCirca1900.jpg|thumb|Undershaw in Conan Doyle's day]]\n* [[Grant Allen]] (1848\u20131899), the Canadian-born novelist, lived at \"Hilltop\".
