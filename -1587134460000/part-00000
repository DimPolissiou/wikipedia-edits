The Mexican federal government has three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial and functions per the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of the United Mexican States]], as enacted in 1917, and as amended.\nThe [[executive power]] is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the president and his [[Cabinet of Mexico|Cabinet]], which, together, are independent of the legislature. [[Legislative power]] is vested upon the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]], a bicameral legislature comprising the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]]. Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]], the Council of the Federal Judiciary, and the collegiate, unitary, and district courts.\n\n==The powers of the union==\nThe federal government, known as the Supreme Power of the Federation, is constituted by the Powers of the Union: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. [[Mexico City]], as the capital of Mexico, seats all the powers of the Union. All branches of government are independent; no two separate branches must be vested upon a single person or institution, and the legislative power must not be vested upon a single individual.\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n{{main|President of Mexico}}\n[[File:MexCity-palacio.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The [[National Palace (Mexico)|Nationaltree Palace]], symbolic seat of the executive branch.]]\n\nThe President of the United Mexican States is the head of the executive branch of the country. He also the [[head of state]], the [[head of government]], and the supreme commander of the [[Mexican army|Armed Forces]]. The President is elected by direct, popular, and universal suffrage. Once elected, the [[candidate]] assumes the position on December 1st of the election year. But after the Electoral Reform of 2014, the President will take office on October 1st of the election year. His position lasts for a period of six years, with no possibility of reelection, not even in the case of having served as interim, provisional or substitute. The office of President of the Republic is only waived for serious cause, which must be qualified by the Congress of the Union. In case of death, dismissal, or resignation, the [[Secretariat of the Interior]] immediately and provisionally assumes the position (if the absence is the day of the inauguration, it would be the president of the senate, the provisional president). Later, with the reservations contemplated by the constitution, it is up to Congress to appoint a substitute or interim. \n\n[[File:EPN._Grito_de_Independencia_2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grito de Independencia ceremony. Mexico DF. September 15, 2013.]]\nThe current [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]] provides for said position in its third title third chapter and is addressed by fifteen articles. They specify the obligations, powers requirements, and restrictions to the position; specifications ranging from the command of the armed forces; \nownership of foreign, economic policies, social development, and public safety; the promulgation and enforcement of laws issued by the legislative branch; \npropose appointments to positions that require of the Senate or the Supreme Court; and various prerogatives granted in other articles of the same magna letter and federal laws.\n\nThe President is the head of the Federal Public Administration and is assisted by a cabinet composed of several Secretariats of State, federal agencies, decentralized agencies, and parastatals, which are in charge of various public interest portfolios, in addition to various advisers on call to the\nOffice of the Presidency. The President is protected by the Presidential General Staff, which is the military technical body that assists the president in obtaining general information, planning the personal activities of the position, performing safety precautions, and participating in the execution of the activities coming for these purposes.\n\nSince the beginning of his term, the official residence of president [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]] has been the National Palace, a building facing the Mexico City [[Z\u00f3calo]]. The National Palace is also the formal seat of the Executive Power and had been the official seat of power in Mexico since early colonial times, until it was moved in 1937 to [[Los Pinos]].\n\n=== Legislative Branch ===\n{{main|Congress of Mexico}}\n[[File:Mexico_Chamber_of_Deputies_backdrop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The backdrop of the Mexican [[Chamber of Deputies]], covered with the [[Constitution of Mexico]], Flag of Mexico and corbata.

The powers of the Congress include the right to pass laws, impose taxes, declare war, approve the national [[budget]], approve or reject treaties and conventions made with foreign countries, and ratify diplomatic appointments. The Senate addresses all matters that concern foreign policy, approves international agreements, and confirms presidential appointments.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies is formed by 500 representatives of the nation. All deputies are elected in free universal elections every three years, in [[parallel voting]]: 300 deputies are elected in single-seat [[electoral district|constituencies]] by first-past-the-post [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (called uninominal deputies), and the remaining 200 are elected by the principle of [[proportional representation]] (called plurinominal deputies) with closed-party lists for which the country is divided into five constituencies or plurinominal circumscriptions. Deputies cannot be reelected for the next immediate term.\n\n[[File:Mexican Senate.jpg|thumb|250px|Senate]]\nBeing a supplementary system (PM) of [[parallel voting]], proportionality is only confined to the plurinominal seats. However, to prevent a party to be overrepresented, several restrictions to the assignation of plurinominal seats are applied:\n* A party must obtain at least 2% of votes to be assigned a plurinominal seat;\n* A party's percentage of deputies in the Chamber (uninominal and plurinominal together) cannot be more than 8% greater than the percentage of votes the party obtained in the elections;\n* No party can have more than 300 seats (uninominal and plurinominal together), even if the party gets more than 52% of the votes.\n\nThe Senate consists of 128 representatives of the constituent states of the federation. All senators are elected in free universal elections every six years through a parallel voting system as well: 64 senators are elected by first-past-the-post plurality, two per state and two for [[Mexico City]] elected jointly; 32 senators are assigned through the principle of \"first minority\", that is, they are awarded to the first runner-up party for each constituent state and Mexico City; and 32 are elected by proportional representation with closed-party lists, for which the country forms a single constituency.\n\n=== Judicial branch ===\n{{see also|Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation}}\n[[File:Suprema1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Supreme court of Justice of the nation]]\nThe judiciary<ref>The composition, responsibilities and requirements of the judicial power are outlined in articles 94 to 107of the [http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12 Political Constitution of the United Mexican States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113000000/http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12 |date=November 13, 2006 }}</ref> consists of The Supreme Court of Justice, composed of eleven judges or ministers appointed by the President with Congress approval, who interpret laws and judge cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary. The ministers of the Supreme Court will serve for 15 years and cannot be appointed to serve more than once.\n\n=== State and local powers===\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of Mexico|List of current state governors in Mexico}}\n\nThe entities of the Mexican Federation are free and sovereigns, autonomous in its internal regime. They have the power to govern themselves according to their own laws; they have their own constitution that doesn't have to contradict the principles of the federal constitution. The powers of its executive and legislative branches they are understood as those that are the rights of the entities; as the ownership of the command of the public force (state police and national guard attached), direction and regulation of their own economic policies, of social development and public safety; as well as the administration of those resources that arise from their local taxes or own income.\n\n===Internal organization of the states===\n{{See also|Municipalities of Mexico}}\n\nThe states are divided internally into municipalities -- or mayors, in the case of Mexico City. Each municipality enjoys autonomy in its capacity \nto choose its own town hall which is responsible, in most cases; to provide all the public services required by its population. To this concept, which would arise from the Mexican Revolution, it is known as free municipality. The town hall is headed by a municipal president elected every three years.\n\n=== Mexico City (formerly Federal District) ===\n{{Politics of Mexico}}\n[[Mexico City]] does not belong to any state in particular, but to the federation, being the capital of the country and seat of the powers of the Union.

The Mexican federal government has three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial and functions per the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of the United Mexican States]], as enacted in 1917, and as amended.\nThe [[executive power]] is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the president and his [[Cabinet of Mexico|Cabinet]], which, together, are independent of the legislature. [[Legislative power]] is vested upon the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]], a bicameral legislature comprising the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]]. Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]], the Council of the Federal Judiciary, and the collegiate, unitary, and district courts.\n\n==The powers of the union==\nThe federal government, known as the Supreme Power of the Federation, is constituted by the Powers of the Union: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. [[Mexico City]], as the capital of Mexico, seats all the powers of the Union. All branches of government are independent; no two separate branches must be vested upon a single person or institution, and the legislative power must not be vested upon a single individual.\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n{{main|President of Mexico}}\n[[File:MexCity-palacio.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]], symbolic seat of the executive branch.]]\n\nThe President of the United Mexican States is the head of the executive branch of the country. He also the [[head of state]], the [[head of government]], and the supreme commander of the [[Mexican army|Armed Forces]]. The President is elected by direct, popular, and universal suffrage. Once elected, the [[candidate]] assumes the position on December 1st of the election year. But after the Electoral Reform of 2014, the President will take office on October 1st of the election year. His position lasts for a period of six years, with no possibility of reelection, not even in the case of having served as interim, provisional or substitute. The office of President of the Republic is only waived for serious cause, which must be qualified by the Congress of the Union. In case of death, dismissal, or resignation, the [[Secretariat of the Interior]] immediately and provisionally assumes the position (if the absence is the day of the inauguration, it would be the president of the senate, the provisional president). Later, with the reservations contemplated by the constitution, it is up to Congress to appoint a substitute or interim. \n\n[[File:EPN._Grito_de_Independencia_2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grito de Independencia ceremony. Mexico DF. September 15, 2013.]]\nThe current [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]] provides for said position in its third title third chapter and is addressed by fifteen articles. They specify the obligations, powers requirements, and restrictions to the position; specifications ranging from the command of the armed forces; \nownership of foreign, economic policies, social development, and public safety; the promulgation and enforcement of laws issued by the legislative branch; \npropose appointments to positions that require of the Senate or the Supreme Court; and various prerogatives granted in other articles of the same magna letter and federal laws.\n\nThe President is the head of the Federal Public Administration and is assisted by a cabinet composed of several Secretariats of State, federal agencies, decentralized agencies, and parastatals, which are in charge of various public interest portfolios, in addition to various advisers on call to the\nOffice of the Presidency. The President is protected by the Presidential General Staff, which is the military technical body that assists the president in obtaining general information, planning the personal activities of the position, performing safety precautions, and participating in the execution of the activities coming for these purposes.\n\nSince the beginning of his term, the official residence of president [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador]] has been the National Palace, a building facing the Mexico City [[Z\u00f3calo]]. The National Palace is also the formal seat of the Executive Power and had been the official seat of power in Mexico since early colonial times, until it was moved in 1937 to [[Los Pinos]].\n\n=== Legislative Branch ===\n{{main|Congress of Mexico}}\n[[File:Mexico_Chamber_of_Deputies_backdrop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The backdrop of the Mexican [[Chamber of Deputies]], covered with the [[Constitution of Mexico]], Flag of Mexico and corbata.

The powers of the Congress include the right to pass laws, impose taxes, declare war, approve the national [[budget]], approve or reject treaties and conventions made with foreign countries, and ratify diplomatic appointments. The Senate addresses all matters that concern foreign policy, approves international agreements, and confirms presidential appointments.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies is formed by 500 representatives of the nation. All deputies are elected in free universal elections every three years, in [[parallel voting]]: 300 deputies are elected in single-seat [[electoral district|constituencies]] by first-past-the-post [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (called uninominal deputies), and the remaining 200 are elected by the principle of [[proportional representation]] (called plurinominal deputies) with closed-party lists for which the country is divided into five constituencies or plurinominal circumscriptions. Deputies cannot be reelected for the next immediate term.\n\n[[File:Mexican Senate.jpg|thumb|250px|Senate]]\nBeing a supplementary system (PM) of [[parallel voting]], proportionality is only confined to the plurinominal seats. However, to prevent a party to be overrepresented, several restrictions to the assignation of plurinominal seats are applied:\n* A party must obtain at least 2% of votes to be assigned a plurinominal seat;\n* A party's percentage of deputies in the Chamber (uninominal and plurinominal together) cannot be more than 8% greater than the percentage of votes the party obtained in the elections;\n* No party can have more than 300 seats (uninominal and plurinominal together), even if the party gets more than 52% of the votes.\n\nThe Senate consists of 128 representatives of the constituent states of the federation. All senators are elected in free universal elections every six years through a parallel voting system as well: 64 senators are elected by first-past-the-post plurality, two per state and two for [[Mexico City]] elected jointly; 32 senators are assigned through the principle of \"first minority\", that is, they are awarded to the first runner-up party for each constituent state and Mexico City; and 32 are elected by proportional representation with closed-party lists, for which the country forms a single constituency.\n\n=== Judicial branch ===\n{{see also|Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation}}\n[[File:Suprema1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Supreme court of Justice of the nation]]\nThe judiciary<ref>The composition, responsibilities and requirements of the judicial power are outlined in articles 94 to 107of the [http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12 Political Constitution of the United Mexican States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113000000/http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12 |date=November 13, 2006 }}</ref> consists of The Supreme Court of Justice, composed of eleven judges or ministers appointed by the President with Congress approval, who interpret laws and judge cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary. The ministers of the Supreme Court will serve for 15 years and cannot be appointed to serve more than once.\n\n=== State and local powers===\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of Mexico|List of current state governors in Mexico}}\n\nThe entities of the Mexican Federation are free and sovereigns, autonomous in its internal regime. They have the power to govern themselves according to their own laws; they have their own constitution that doesn't have to contradict the principles of the federal constitution. The powers of its executive and legislative branches they are understood as those that are the rights of the entities; as the ownership of the command of the public force (state police and national guard attached), direction and regulation of their own economic policies, of social development and public safety; as well as the administration of those resources that arise from their local taxes or own income.\n\n===Internal organization of the states===\n{{See also|Municipalities of Mexico}}\n\nThe states are divided internally into municipalities -- or mayors, in the case of Mexico City. Each municipality enjoys autonomy in its capacity \nto choose its own town hall which is responsible, in most cases; to provide all the public services required by its population. To this concept, which would arise from the Mexican Revolution, it is known as free municipality. The town hall is headed by a municipal president elected every three years.\n\n=== Mexico City (formerly Federal District) ===\n{{Politics of Mexico}}\n[[Mexico City]] does not belong to any state in particular, but to the federation, being the capital of the country and seat of the powers of the Union.

Schoenberg, ''Mr. Capone,'' HarperCollins Publishers, 1992. {{ISBN|0-688-12838-6}}</ref> (June 30, 1895 - February 23, 1935) was a member of [[Al Capone]]'s [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based criminal organization known as the [[Chicago Outfit]]. He was also an alleged gunman in the famous 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].<ref name=\"Schoenberg\" />\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to his death certificate, Frank Rio was born June 30, 1895 in Lovato, Italy, to Antonio and Rosa (Costa) Rio. It is possible that Rio may have been born in Chicago after his parents had already emigrated to the United States, or that he was brought into the country under a different name.\n\nRio married the former Anna Blanche in the mid-1910s. The couple adopted two children, a boy and a girl.\n\n==Organized crime involvement==\nRio's involvement in crime began early in life, and included [[robbery]], [[burglary]], and [[Motor vehicle theft|auto theft]]. In 1918, he was arrested several times in connection with several different hold-ups. In September 1918, he was arrested for robbing a bank in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], but never convicted. On November 10, 1919, Rio was arrested after [[police]] caught him loading stolen [[Fur clothing|furs]] into a stolen vehicle. On January 17, 1921, Rio\u2014along with Robert O'Neill and Thomas Dyer\u2014robbed a mail train at Chicago's Union Station, stealing bonds worth $482,000. Although indicted for the daring daylight robbery, Rio was never brought to trial and the charges dropped.<ref>\"Mail Robbery Suspects Are Held to Grand Jury,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 4, 1921; \"$1,000,000 Mail Robbery Solved, Inspectors Say,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 3, 1921.</ref> Rio's ability to escape punishment could not be attributed to good luck or innocence but rather to the bribing of judges and the intimidation and murder of witnesses. In time, criminal elements dubbed him \"Slippery\" Frank Rio for his knack at evading trial.<ref>Edwin W. Sims, \"Fighting Crime in Chicago: The Crime Commission,\" ''Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,'' 11:1 (May 1920).</ref>\n\n===Capone gang===\nRio's criminal exploits brought him to the attention of Al Capone, leader of the Chicago Outfit. Capone quickly came to trust Rio's judgment, and Rio became intensely loyal to Capone. Rio eventually became one of Capone's personal bodyguards and took care of some of Capone's personal needs and business. Capone himself is rumored to have said that [[Jack McGurn]] and Rio were his \"golden boys\".\n\nRio became one of Capone's most recognizable and loyal hitmen. He allegedly once threw Capone to the ground during a [[Contract killing|hit]] by [[Hymie Weiss|Earl \"Hymie\" Weiss]].<ref>Jack Kelly, \"Gangster City,\" ''American Heritage,'' 46:2 (April 1995). One other source attributes the saving of Capone's life to [[Tony Accardo]] instead. See: William F. Jr Roemer, ''Accardo: The Genuine Godfather,'' Ivy Books, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8041-1464-1}}</ref> Rio also is said to have foiled a plot by [[Albert Anselmi]], [[John Scalise]] and [[Joseph Guinta]] to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit. Underworld figures later claimed that Rio was one of the trio's executioners.<ref name=\"Wicked\">Curt Johnson and R. Craig Sautter, ''The Wicked City: Chicago from Kenna to Capone,'' paperback ed., Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80821-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Rio was suspected as possibly one of the hitmen who murdered five rival gang members, a gang \"hanger on\" and the gangs occasional auto mechanic in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Posing as police officers, four men entered a warehouse at 2122 N. Clark Street used by [[Bugs Moran|George \"Bugs\" Moran]] and his gang. The men lined their seven victims against a wall as if to frisk and handcuff them. They then pulled [[Thompson submachine gun]]s from their overcoats and murdered the men.<ref name=\"Schoenberg\" />  Two of the men also suffered shotgun blasts to the head. Rio has always been a strong suspect as one of the shooters, but notwithstanding good circumstantial claims for more than a ''dozen'' different men (there were only four shooters), it is still not known for certain who any of the four shooters were.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nRio also attended the 1929 [[Atlantic City Conference]] with Capone. Capone arranged to have himself jailed in Philadelphia after the conference in order to avoid the numerous \"[[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]]\" rackets that were hunting him. Rio served time alongside Capone to protect him and see to his needs.<ref name=\"Wicked\" />\n\nRio was allegedly one of the few members of Capone's gang who understood the seriousness of the [[tax evasion]] charges made against Capone by the federal government in 1931. However, he was unable to convince Capone of this, and Capone was convicted and imprisoned.\n\nAfter Capone was sent to federal prison, Rio was considered as his successor.<ref>Eghigian, p. 211.</ref> But Rio was opposed by many high-level mobsters in the Capone organization. Many thought he had too little leadership experience. Several gangsters also accused Rio of having \"gone soft\" due to his years of \"high living\" he had enjoyed alongside Capone. Rio was eventually passed over in favor of another Capone hitman and lieutenant, [[Frank Nitti]].\n\n===Post-Capone activities===\nAlthough Rio never left the Capone mob, his association with it dwindled over the next several years. In 1932, the Chicago Outfit sent Rio to [[New Jersey]] to offer the mob's assistance in helping [[Charles Lindbergh]] find his [[Charles Lindbergh#Kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr.|kidnapped baby son]]. His assistance was refused.\nRio's health also began to deteriorate. He suffered from [[heart disease]], which caused severe shortness of breath and physical weakness. Beginning in 1933, he rarely left his [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] home. However, he maintained financial interests in a number of cafes, nightclubs and casinos.\n\n==Death==\nFrank Rio died at noon on February 23, 1935. The cause of death was a [[coronary occlusion]], causing a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].\n\nAssociates in the Chicago Outfit took charge of his remains and had him buried. Police later said that gang members became involved in his burial because they wanted to divide up Rio's gang-owned assets before news of his death hit the streets.\n\nAlthough a [[Roman Catholic]], the Church denied Rio a church funeral. A priest said prayers over his body at a local undertakers instead. As befitting a high-level mobster, his funeral was an exceedingly large one. Several hundred automobiles bearing mourners comprised the funeral cortege. He was interred in Mount Carmel Cemetery in [[Hillside, Illinois]].\n\nRio's widow, Anna, got re-married on November 29, 1935 to Charles Taskoski. She died shortly after the marriage in an automobile accident on December 26, 1935. She left behind a large amount of jewelry and cash. According to family members, mobsters later intimidated the family into turning the valuables and cash over to the Chicago Outfit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/355048307/?terms=Charles%20Taskoski&match=1|title=11 Jan 1936, 3 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nFrank Rio was portrayed by [[Ron Smith]] in the 2017 film ''[[Gangster Land]]'' <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7241654/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title='Gangster Land': Full Cast & Crew |website=[[IMDB]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*\"Capone Allies See His Finish and Dispute for Gang Throne.\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune.''

Schoenberg, ''Mr. Capone,'' HarperCollins Publishers, 1992. {{ISBN|0-688-12838-6}}</ref> (June 30, 1895 - February 23, 1935) was a member of [[Al Capone]]'s [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based criminal organization known as the [[Chicago Outfit]]. He was also an alleged gunman in the famous 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].<ref name=\"Schoenberg\" />\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to his death certificate, Frank Rio was born June 30, 1895 in Lovato, Italy, to Antonio and Rosa (Costa) Rio. It is possible that Rio may have been born in Chicago after his parents had already emigrated to the United States, or that he was brought into the country under a different name.\n\nRio married the former Anna Blanche in the mid-1910s. The couple adopted two children, a boy and a girl.\n\n==Organized crime involvement==\nRio's involvement in crime began early in life, and included [[robbery]], [[burglary]], and [[Motor vehicle theft|auto theft]]. In 1918, he was arrested several times in connection with several different hold-ups. In September 1918, he was arrested for robbing a bank in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], but never convicted. On November 10, 1919, Rio was arrested after [[police]] caught him loading stolen [[Fur clothing|furs]] into a stolen vehicle. On January 17, 1921, Rio\u2014along with Robert O'Neill and Thomas Dyer\u2014robbed a mail train at Chicago's Union Station, stealing bonds worth $482,000. Although indicted for the daring daylight robbery, Rio was never brought to trial and the charges dropped.<ref>\"Mail Robbery Suspects Are Held to Grand Jury,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 4, 1921; \"$1,000,000 Mail Robbery Solved, Inspectors Say,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 3, 1921.</ref> Rio's ability to escape punishment could not be attributed to good luck or innocence but rather to the bribing of judges and the intimidation and murder of witnesses. In time, criminal elements dubbed him \"Slippery\" Frank Rio for his knack at evading trial.<ref>Edwin W. Sims, \"Fighting Crime in Chicago: The Crime Commission,\" ''Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,'' 11:1 (May 1920).</ref>\n\n===Capone gang===\nRio's criminal exploits brought him to the attention of Al Capone, leader of the Chicago Outfit. Capone quickly came to trust Rio's judgment, and Rio became intensely loyal to Capone. Rio eventually became one of Capone's personal bodyguards and took care of some of Capone's personal needs and business. Capone himself is rumored to have said that [[Jack McGurn]] and Rio were his \"golden boys\".\n\nRio became one of Capone's most recognizable and loyal hitmen. He allegedly once threw Capone to the ground during a [[Contract killing|hit]] by [[Hymie Weiss|Earl \"Hymie\" Weiss]].<ref>Jack Kelly, \"Gangster City,\" ''American Heritage,'' 46:2 (April 1995). One other source attributes the saving of Capone's life to [[Tony Accardo]] instead. See: William F. Jr Roemer, ''Accardo: The Genuine Godfather,'' Ivy Books, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8041-1464-1}}</ref> Rio also is said to have foiled a plot by [[Albert Anselmi]], [[John Scalise]] and [[Joseph Guinta]] to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit. Underworld figures later claimed that Rio was one of the trio's executioners.<ref name=\"Wicked\">Curt Johnson and R. Craig Sautter, ''The Wicked City: Chicago from Kenna to Capone,'' paperback ed., Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80821-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Rio was suspected as possibly one of the hitmen who murdered five rival gang members, a gang \"hanger on\" and the gangs occasional auto mechanic in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Posing as police officers, four men entered a warehouse at 2122 N. Clark Street used by [[Bugs Moran|George \"Bugs\" Moran]] and his gang. The men lined their seven victims against a wall as if to frisk and handcuff them. They then pulled [[Thompson submachine gun]]s from their overcoats and murdered the men.<ref name=\"Schoenberg\" />  Two of the men also suffered shotgun blasts to the head. Rio has always been a strong suspect as one of the shooters, but notwithstanding good circumstantial claims for more than a ''dozen'' different men (there were only four shooters), it is still not known for certain who any of the four shooters were.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nRio also attended the 1929 [[Atlantic City Conference]] with Capone. Capone arranged to have himself jailed in Philadelphia after the conference in order to avoid the numerous \"[[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]]\" rackets that were hunting him. Rio served time alongside Capone to protect him and see to his needs.<ref name=\"Wicked\" />\n\nRio was allegedly one of the few members of Capone's gang who understood the seriousness of the [[tax evasion]] charges made against Capone by the federal government in 1931. However, he was unable to convince Capone of this, and Capone was convicted and imprisoned.\n\nAfter Capone was sent to federal prison, Rio was considered as his successor.<ref>Eghigian, p. 211.</ref> But Rio was opposed by many high-level mobsters in the Capone organization. Many thought he had too little leadership experience. Several gangsters also accused Rio of having \"gone soft\" due to his years of \"high living\" he had enjoyed alongside Capone. Rio was eventually passed over in favor of another Capone hitman and lieutenant, [[Frank Nitti]].\n\n===Post-Capone activities===\nAlthough Rio never left the Capone mob, his association with it dwindled over the next several years.
