''[[The Guardian]]''. 24 September 2003.</ref>\n\nAlthough composed in 1965, ''The Likes of Us'' was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]]. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected.

He acknowledged a similarity between the Andante movement of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor]] and the ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' song \"[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\n{{quote|\n...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's.

The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from \"Phantom of the Opera\" plays D, C#, C, B, A#, then ascending A#, B, C, C#, D. Pink Floyd's \"Echoes\" plays C#, C, B, A#, A, then ascending A, A#, B, C, C#.

In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].

This [[still life]] painting depicts a variety of French Baroque musical instruments, such as a [[natural horn]], [[transverse flute]], [[Musette de cour|musette]], [[pardessus de viole]], and [[lute]].]]\nA '''musical instrument''' is a device created or adapted to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument\u2014it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a [[horn (music)|horn]] to signal success on the hunt, or a [[drum]] in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of [[melody|melodies]] for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple [[flute]], dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood and other non-durable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far fzjwkfhwisnfbenwlwrom their origin. By the [[Middle Ages]], instruments from [[Mesopotamia]] were in [[maritime Southeast Asia]], and Europeans played instruments originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. \n\nBy 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]]. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. While the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, new electronic instruments such as [[electric guitar]]s and [[synthesizer]]s were invented.\n\nMusical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method, [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]], uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called [[organology]].\n\n==Definition and basic operation==\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Bamileke]] [[slit drum]] drummers in Cameroon's [[West Province (Cameroon)|West Province]].]]\nA musical instrument is used to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies \u2014 for example, by clapping\u2014to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.<ref name=\"Montagu1\">{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=1}}</ref> Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.<ref name=\"Rault9\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=9}}</ref> The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were probably unknown to early players of musical instruments. A person sounding a bone flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of \"making music\".<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\nMusical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from \"found objects\" such as shells and plant parts.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way \u2014 for example, by plucking the strings on a [[string instrument]], striking the surface of a drum, or blowing into an animal horn.<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\n==Archaeology==\nResearchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifying about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.<ref name=\"Blades34\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|Found in [[Slovenia]], the [[Divje Babe Flute]] is considered the world's [[paleolithic flutes|oldest known musical instrument]]]]\nIn July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of [[Slovenia]]. The carving, named the [[Divje Babe Flute]], features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a [[diatonic scale]]. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years old, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the [[Neanderthal]] culture.<ref name=\"SAS\">{{harvnb|Slovenian Academy of Sciences|1997|pp=203\u2013205}}</ref> However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument.<ref name=\"Chase and Nowell\">{{harvnb|Chase|Nowell|1998|p=549}}</ref> German archaeologists have found [[mammoth]] bone and [[swan]] bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the [[Swabian Alps]].

These instruments, one of the first ensembles of instruments yet discovered, include nine [[lyre]]s ( the [[Lyres of Ur]]), two [[harp]]s, a silver double [[flute]], a [[sistra]] and [[cymbal]]s. A set of reed-sounded silver pipes discovered in Ur was the likely predecessor of modern [[bagpipes]].<ref name=\"collinson\">{{harvnb|Collinson|1975|p=10}}</ref> The cylindrical pipes feature three side-holes that allowed players to produce whole tone scales.<ref name=\"Campbell82\">{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=82}}</ref> These excavations, carried out by [[Leonard Woolley]] in the 1920s, uncovered non-degradable fragments of instruments and the voids left by the degraded segments that, together, have been used to reconstruct them.<ref name=\"de Schauensee\">{{harvnb|de Schauensee|2002|pp=1\u201316}}</ref> The graves these instruments were buried in have been [[carbon dated]] to between 2600 and 2500 BC, providing evidence that these instruments were used in Sumeria by this time.<ref name=\"Moorey\">{{harvnb|Moorey|1977|pp=24\u201340}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologists in the [[Jiahu]] site of central [[Henan province]] of China have found flutes made of bones that date back 7,000 to 9,000 years,<ref name=bnl>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/1999/bnlpr092299.html|title=Brookhaven Lab Expert Helps Date Flute Thought to be Oldest Playable Musical Instrument|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref> representing some of the \"earliest complete, playable, tightly-dated, multinote musical instruments\" ever found.<ref name=bnl/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jiah/hd_jiah.htm|title=Jiahu (ca. 7000\u20135700 B.C.)|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nScholars agree that there are no completely reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early [[slit drum]]s involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.<ref name=\"Sachs60\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=60}}</ref>\n\nGerman musicologist [[Curt Sachs]], one of the most prominent [[Musicology|musicologists]]<ref name=\"Brown\">{{harvnb|Brown|2008}}</ref> and [[Ethnomusicology|musical ethnologists]]<ref name=\"Baines37\">{{harvnb|Baines|1993|p=37}}</ref> in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. For example, contemporary [[anthropology|anthropologists]] comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft [[Anthropological theories of value|cannot determine which instruments are more \"primitive\"]].<ref name=\"Sachs61\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=61}}</ref> Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge. Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.<ref name=\"Sachs63\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=63}}</ref> Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.<ref name=\"Sachs63\" />\n\nThe science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better historical picture.<ref name=\"Blades34\" />\n\n===Primitive and prehistoric===\n[[File:Two Teponaztli.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aztec]] slit drums (''[[teponaztli]]''). The characteristic \"'''H'''\" slits can be seen on the top of the drum in the foreground.]]\n[[File:Guitar (molo).jpg|thumb|Guitar (molo)]]\nUntil the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]], descendant of [[Cain]] and \"father of all such as handle the harp and the organ\", [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], inventor of the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who is said to have made a dried [[tortoise]] shell into the first [[lyre]]. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive \"invention\" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term \"musical instrument\" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a ''[[Homo habilis]]'' slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.<ref name=\"Sachs297\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=297}}</ref>\n\nAmong the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], stampers, and various [[drum]]s.<ref name=\"Blades36\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=36}}</ref> These instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.<ref name=\"Sachs26\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=26}}</ref> Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.<ref name=\"Rault34\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=34}}</ref> Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than resemblance to modern instruments.<ref name=Sachs34>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=34\u201352}}</ref> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the [[Chukchi people]] of the [[Russian Far East]], the indigenous people of [[Melanesia]], and many cultures of [[Africa]]. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.<ref name=\"Blades51\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=51}}</ref> One East African tribe, the [[Wahinda]], believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.<ref name=Sachs35>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=35}}</ref>\n\nHumans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments to produce [[melody]], which was previously common only in singing. Similar to the process of [[reduplication]] in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes\u2014one tube would produce a \"clear\" sound and the other would answer with a \"darker\" sound. Such instrument pairs also included [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated them with gender; the \"father\" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the \"mother\" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest [[xylophone]].<ref name=Sachs52>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of [[Southeast Asia]], eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.<ref name=\"Marcuse24\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|pp=24\u201328}}</ref> Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three \"leg bars\" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the [[harp|ground harp]], [[zither|ground zither]], [[musical bow]], and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref name=Sachs53>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=53\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nImages of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylon]]ian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to [[division of labor]] and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.<ref name=Sachs67>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=67}}</ref> Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in [[Mesopotamia]]. Scholars must rely on artifacts and [[cuneiform]] texts written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<ref name=Sachs68>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have distinguished six [[idiophone]]s used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, [[Sistrum|sistra]], bells, cymbals, and rattles.<ref name=Sachs69>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=69}}</ref> Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of [[Amenhotep III]],<ref name=Remnant168>{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=168}}</ref> and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and among the Native American [[Yaqui]] tribe.<ref name=Sachs70>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=70}}</ref> The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the [[violin]].<ref name=Sachs82>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=82}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Egyptian lute players 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb painting depicting lute players, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ({{circa|1350}} BC)]]\nMusical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess.<ref name=Sachs86>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=86}}</ref> However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.<ref name=\"Rault71\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=71}}</ref>\n\nLittle history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the [[Kassites]] destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the [[Hyksos]] destroy the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Under their new cultural influences, the people of the [[New Kingdom]] began using [[oboe]]s, trumpets, [[lyre]]s, [[lute]]s, [[castanets]], and [[cymbal]]s.<ref name=Sachs98>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=98\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in [[Israel]] between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]].<ref name=Sachs105>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=105}}</ref> The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]]: the ''ugab'' (pipes) and ''[[kinnor]]'' (lyre).<ref name=Sachs106>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=106}}</ref> Other instruments of the period included the ''tof'' ([[frame drum]]), ''pa'amon'' (small bells or jingles), [[shofar]], and the trumpet-like ''hasosra''.<ref name=Sachs108>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=108\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of a monarchy in Israel during the 11th&nbsp;century BC produced the first professional musicians and with them a drastic increase in the number and variety of musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs114>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=114}}</ref> However, identifying and classifying the instruments remains a challenge due to the lack of artistic interpretations. For example, stringed instruments of uncertain design called nevals and asors existed, but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them.<ref name=Sachs116>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=116}}</ref> In her book ''A Survey of Musical Instruments'', American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse proposes that the nevel must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to ''nabla'', the Phoenician term for \"harp\".<ref name=\"Marcuse385\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=385}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Greece]], [[Rome]], and [[Etruria]], the use and development of musical instruments stood in stark contrast to those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures.<ref name=Sachs128>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=128}}</ref> Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods.<ref name=Sachs129>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=129}}</ref> Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as ''[[aulos]]'' (reeds) or ''[[syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]]'' (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique.<ref name=Campbell82/> Romans played reed instruments named ''[[tibia (instrument)|tibia]]'', featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes.<ref name=Campbell83>{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=83}}</ref> Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the [[Orient]], lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.<ref name=Sachs149>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=149}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of musical instruments in use by early civilizations of [[India]] is almost completely lacking, making it impossible to reliably attribute instruments to the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs151>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=151}}</ref> A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the [[Indus script]] has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the [[Rigveda]], or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes.<ref name=Sachs152>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=152}}</ref> Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the [[Snake charming|snake charmer's]] [[double clarinet]], [[bagpipes]], barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Sachs161>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=161}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mokugyo.jpg|thumb|A Chinese [[wooden fish]], used in Buddhist recitations]]\nMusical instruments such as [[zither]]s appeared in Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier.<ref name=Sachs185>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=185}}</ref> Early [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophers]] such as [[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 BC), [[Mencius]] (372\u2013289 BC), and [[Laozi]] shaped the development of musical instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music similar to that of the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.<ref name=Sachs162>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=162\u2013164}}</ref>\n\n[[Idiophone]]s were extremely important in Chinese music, hence the majority of early instruments were idiophones.

Wind instruments such as flute, [[pan-pipe]]s, [[pitch-pipe]]s, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period.<ref name=Sachs178>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=178}}</ref> The ''[[Xiao (flute)|xiao]]'' (an [[end-blown flute]]) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the [[Han dynasty]].<ref name=Sachs189>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=189}}</ref>\n\nAlthough civilizations in [[Central America]] attained a relatively high level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations in the development of musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody.<ref name=Sachs192>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=192}}</ref> In contrast, [[pre-Columbian]] [[South America]]n civilizations in areas such as modern-day [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Chile]] were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.<ref name=Sachs196>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=196\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Painting ney.jpg|thumb|A young Persian lady playing a ''[[ney]]'', painted on [[Hasht Behesht]] walls in [[Esfahan]], [[Safavid dynasty]]. ]]\nDuring the period of time loosely referred to as the [[Middle Ages]], China developed a tradition of integrating musical influence from other regions.  The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in [[Turkestan]]. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.<ref name=Sachs207>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=207}}</ref> Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.<ref name=Sachs218>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=218}}</ref> Some of the first [[Bow (music)|bowed]] zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.<ref name=Sachs216>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=216}}</ref>\n\nIndia experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and [[tremolo]]s of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music.<ref name=Sachs221>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=221}}</ref> Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.<ref name=Sachs222>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, idiophones such as [[handbell]]s, cymbals, and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music. The gong-like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet. Tubular drums, stick zithers ([[veena]]), short fiddles, double and triple flutes, coiled trumpets, and curved India horns emerged in this time period.<ref name=Sachs223>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=222\u2013228}}</ref> Islamic influences brought new types of drums, perfectly circular or octagonal as opposed to the irregular pre-Islamic drums.<ref name=Sachs229>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=229}}</ref> Persian influence brought oboes and [[sitar]]s, although Persian sitars had three strings and Indian version had from four to seven.<ref name=Sachs231>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=231}}</ref> The Islamic culture also introduced double-[[clarinet]] instruments as the [[Alboka]] (from Arab, al-buq or \"horn\") nowadays only alive in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Country]].

Keyboards and lutes developed as [[polyphonic]] instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced [[tablature]]. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments.<ref name=\"Sachs297\" /> In the latter half of the sixteenth century, [[orchestration]] came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion.<ref name=Sachs298>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=298}}</ref> The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.<ref name=Sachs351>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Duet c1635 by Saftleven.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Duet'', by Dutch painter [[Cornelis Saftleven]], c. 1635. It shows a [[violin]]ist and a [[cittern]] player.]]\nBeginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s 1511 treatise ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').<ref name=\"Sachs298\" /> Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of \"irregular\" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including [[Arnolt Schlick]]'s ''Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten'' ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.<ref name=Sachs299>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=299}}</ref> Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]], is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs301>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=301}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments \u2013 such as the violin \u2013 the \"classical shapes\" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.<ref name=Sachs302>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=302}}</ref> It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of ''consorts'', or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.<ref name=Sachs303>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=303}}</ref>\n\nInstrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with [[Organ stop|solo stops]] emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.<ref name=Sachs307>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=307}}</ref> Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used [[Mute (music)|mutes]] to properly blend into [[chamber music]].<ref name=Sachs328>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=328}}</ref>\n\n====Baroque====\n[[File:Stainer.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque]] mounted [[Jacob Stainer]] violin from 1658]]\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, composers began writing works to a higher emotional degree. They felt that [[Polyphony|polyphony]] better suited the emotional style they were aiming for and began writing musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.<ref name=Sachs351/> As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.<ref name=Sachs352>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=352}}</ref> Bowed instruments such as the violin, [[viola]], [[baryton]], and various lutes dominated popular music.<ref name=Sachs353>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=353\u2013357}}</ref> Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the [[guitar]].<ref name=Sachs374>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=374}}</ref> As the prevalence of [[string orchestra]]s rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.<ref name=Sachs380>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=380}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an \"art instrument\" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range. The details of this transformation are unclear, but the modern [[French horn|horn]] or, more colloquially, French horn, had emerged by 1725.<ref name=Sachs384>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=384}}</ref> The [[slide trumpet]] appeared, a variation that includes a long-throated mouthpiece that slid in and out, allowing the player infinite adjustments in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it.<ref name=Sachs385>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=385}}</ref> Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals. Sachs viewed this trend as a \"degeneration\" of the general organ sound.<ref name=Sachs386>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=386}}</ref>\n\n====Classical and Romantic====\n\n[[File:Mozart family crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] plays the keyboard while his father, [[Leopold Mozart]], plays violin.]]\nDuring the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, a great deal of musical instruments capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.<ref name=Sachs388>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=388}}</ref>\n\nSome instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes\u2014most of them unsuccessful\u2014in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a \"defective\" range\u2014they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.<ref name=Sachs389>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=389}}</ref> New instruments such as the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], and [[tuba]] became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire \"families\" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.<ref name=Sachs388/>\n\nAccompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average [[concert pitch]] began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.<ref name=Sachs390>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=390}}</ref> Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like [[Hector Berlioz]], no standard could be agreed upon.<ref name=Sachs391>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=391}}</ref>\n\n====Twentieth century to present====\n[[File:FGF museum 01.

Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the [[Range (music)|range]] of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an [[orchestra]] or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.<ref name=Montagu210>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=210}}</ref> The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.<ref name=Montagu211>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=211}}</ref><ref name=Kartomi176>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=176}}</ref> The most common types of instrument classifications are [[String instrument|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n\n===Ancient systems===\nAn ancient Hindu system named the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written by the sage [[Bharata Muni]] and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and \"solid\", or non-skin, percussion instruments.<ref name=Montagu211/> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by [[Johannes de Muris]], who used the terms ''tensibilia'' (stringed instruments), ''inflatibilia'' (wind instruments), and ''percussibilia'' (all percussion instruments).<ref name=\"Rault190\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=190}}</ref> In 1880, [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] adapted the ''Natya Shastra'' and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: ''chordophones'' (stringed instruments), ''membranophones'' (skin-head percussion instruments), ''aerophones'' (wind instruments), and ''autophones'' (non-skin percussion instruments).<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\n===Hornbostel\u2013Sachs===\n[[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie'' in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term ''autophone'' with ''idiophone''.<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\nThe original [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] system classified instruments into four main groups:\n* [[Idiophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as [[claves]], [[xylophone]], [[guiro]], [[slit drum]], [[mbira]], and [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].<ref name=Marcuse3>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=3}}</ref>\n* [[Membranophone]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be [[drums]] (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but [[kazoos]] and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.<ref name=Marcuse117>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=117}}</ref>\n* [[Chordophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a [[zither]] whether it is plucked like an [[autoharp]] or struck with hammers like a [[piano]]. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a [[lute]], whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a [[guitar]] or uses a membrane like a [[banjo]].<ref name=Marcuse177>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=177}}</ref>\n* [[Aerophone]]s, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a [[bullroarer]] or [[whip]], which move freely through the air; reedless aerophones such as [[flute]]s and recorders, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed, including the clarinet and saxophone (this category may be further divided into two classifications: single-reeded and double-reeded instruments. The latter includes oboes and bassoons); and lip-vibrated aerophones such as [[trumpet]]s, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.<ref name=Marcuse549>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=549}}</ref>\n\nSachs later added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.<ref name=\"Sachs447\"/> Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].<ref name=\"Rault190\" /><ref name=\"Campbell39\">{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Schaeffner===\nAndre Schaeffner, a curator at the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme]], disagreed with the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel\u2013Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.<ref name=Kartomi174>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\n{{main|Range (music)}}\nMusical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.\n\nThese terms are named after singing voice classifications:\n* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[violin]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[piccolo]]\n* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto saxophone]], [[french horn]], [[english horn]], [[viola]], [[alto horn]]\n* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[guitar]], [[tenor drum]]\n* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]]\n* [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[contrabassoon]], [[bass saxophone]], [[tuba]], [[bass drum]]\n\nSome instruments fall into more than one category. For example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble. The trombone and French horn may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], [[alto flute]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example the [[sopranino saxophone]] and [[contrabass clarinet]]. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C<sub>3</sub> to F\u266f<sub>6</sub>, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:African music instrument made from a can 01.jpg|thumb|African [[Mbira|kalimba]] made from a food can]]\n<!--[[Musical instrument construction]] redirects directly here.-->\nThe materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]].<ref name=\"Rault184\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=184}}</ref> [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance\u2014instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers.

Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a [[luthier]] makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Rault195\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=195}}</ref> Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop [[experimental musical instrument]]s, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder themself.\n\n==User interfaces==\n[[File:Usnaconsole2.jpg|thumb|The five-manual, 522-stop detached console at the [[Naval Academy Chapel|United States Naval Academy Chapel]] crafted by R.

This [[still life]] painting depicts a variety of French Baroque musical instruments, such as a [[natural horn]], [[transverse flute]], [[Musette de cour|musette]], [[pardessus de viole]], and [[lute]].]]\nA '''musical instrument''' is a device created or adapted to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument\u2014it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a [[horn (music)|horn]] to signal success on the hunt, or a [[drum]] in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of [[melody|melodies]] for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple [[flute]], dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood and other non-durable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the [[Middle Ages]], instruments from [[Mesopotamia]] were in [[maritime Southeast Asia]], and Europeans played instruments originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. \n\nBy 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]]. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. While the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, new electronic instruments such as [[electric guitar]]s and [[synthesizer]]s were invented.\n\nMusical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method, [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]], uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called [[organology]].\n\n==Definition and basic operation==\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Bamileke]] [[slit drum]] drummers in Cameroon's [[West Province (Cameroon)|West Province]].]]\nA musical instrument is used to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies \u2014 for example, by clapping\u2014to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.<ref name=\"Montagu1\">{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=1}}</ref> Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.<ref name=\"Rault9\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=9}}</ref> The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were probably unknown to early players of musical instruments. A person sounding a bone flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of \"making music\".<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\nMusical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from \"found objects\" such as shells and plant parts.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way \u2014 for example, by plucking the strings on a [[string instrument]], striking the surface of a drum, or blowing into an animal horn.<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\n==Archaeology==\nResearchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifying about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.<ref name=\"Blades34\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|Found in [[Slovenia]], the [[Divje Babe Flute]] is considered the world's [[paleolithic flutes|oldest known musical instrument]]]]\nIn July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of [[Slovenia]].

Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early [[slit drum]]s involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.<ref name=\"Sachs60\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=60}}</ref>\n\nGerman musicologist [[Curt Sachs]], one of the most prominent [[Musicology|musicologists]]<ref name=\"Brown\">{{harvnb|Brown|2008}}</ref> and [[Ethnomusicology|musical ethnologists]]<ref name=\"Baines37\">{{harvnb|Baines|1993|p=37}}</ref> in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. For example, contemporary [[anthropology|anthropologists]] comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft [[Anthropological theories of value|cannot determine which instruments are more \"primitive\"]].<ref name=\"Sachs61\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=61}}</ref> Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge. Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.<ref name=\"Sachs63\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=63}}</ref> Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.<ref name=\"Sachs63\" />\n\nThe science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better historical picture.<ref name=\"Blades34\" />\n\n===Primitive and prehistoric===\n[[File:Two Teponaztli.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aztec]] slit drums (''[[teponaztli]]''). The characteristic \"'''H'''\" slits can be seen on the top of the drum in the foreground.]]\n[[File:Guitar (molo).jpg|thumb|Guitar (molo)]]\nUntil the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]], descendant of [[Cain]] and \"father of all such as handle the harp and the organ\", [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], inventor of the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who is said to have made a dried [[tortoise]] shell into the first [[lyre]]. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive \"invention\" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term \"musical instrument\" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a ''[[Homo habilis]]'' slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.<ref name=\"Sachs297\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=297}}</ref>\n\nAmong the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], stampers, and various [[drum]]s.<ref name=\"Blades36\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=36}}</ref> These instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.<ref name=\"Sachs26\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=26}}</ref> Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.<ref name=\"Rault34\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=34}}</ref> Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than resemblance to modern instruments.<ref name=Sachs34>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=34\u201352}}</ref> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the [[Chukchi people]] of the [[Russian Far East]], the indigenous people of [[Melanesia]], and many cultures of [[Africa]]. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.<ref name=\"Blades51\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=51}}</ref> One East African tribe, the [[Wahinda]], believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.<ref name=Sachs35>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=35}}</ref>\n\nHumans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments to produce [[melody]], which was previously common only in singing. Similar to the process of [[reduplication]] in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes\u2014one tube would produce a \"clear\" sound and the other would answer with a \"darker\" sound. Such instrument pairs also included [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated them with gender; the \"father\" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the \"mother\" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest [[xylophone]].<ref name=Sachs52>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of [[Southeast Asia]], eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.<ref name=\"Marcuse24\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|pp=24\u201328}}</ref> Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three \"leg bars\" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the [[harp|ground harp]], [[zither|ground zither]], [[musical bow]], and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref name=Sachs53>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=53\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nImages of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylon]]ian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to [[division of labor]] and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.<ref name=Sachs67>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=67}}</ref> Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in [[Mesopotamia]]. Scholars must rely on artifacts and [[cuneiform]] texts written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<ref name=Sachs68>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have distinguished six [[idiophone]]s used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, [[Sistrum|sistra]], bells, cymbals, and rattles.<ref name=Sachs69>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=69}}</ref> Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of [[Amenhotep III]],<ref name=Remnant168>{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=168}}</ref> and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and among the Native American [[Yaqui]] tribe.<ref name=Sachs70>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=70}}</ref> The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the [[violin]].<ref name=Sachs82>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=82}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Egyptian lute players 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb painting depicting lute players, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ({{circa|1350}} BC)]]\nMusical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another.

This period saw the [[Kassites]] destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the [[Hyksos]] destroy the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Under their new cultural influences, the people of the [[New Kingdom]] began using [[oboe]]s, trumpets, [[lyre]]s, [[lute]]s, [[castanets]], and [[cymbal]]s.<ref name=Sachs98>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=98\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in [[Israel]] between 2000 and 1000 BC.

The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in [[Turkestan]]. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.<ref name=Sachs207>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=207}}</ref> Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.<ref name=Sachs218>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=218}}</ref> Some of the first [[Bow (music)|bowed]] zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.<ref name=Sachs216>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=216}}</ref>\n\nIndia experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and [[tremolo]]s of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music.<ref name=Sachs221>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=221}}</ref> Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.<ref name=Sachs222>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, idiophones such as [[handbell]]s, cymbals, and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music. The gong-like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet.

Keyboards and lutes developed as [[polyphonic]] instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced [[tablature]]. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments.<ref name=\"Sachs297\" /> In the latter half of the sixteenth century, [[orchestration]] came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion.<ref name=Sachs298>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=298}}</ref> The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.<ref name=Sachs351>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Duet c1635 by Saftleven.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Duet'', by Dutch painter [[Cornelis Saftleven]], c. 1635. It shows a [[violin]]ist and a [[cittern]] player.]]\nBeginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s 1511 treatise ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').<ref name=\"Sachs298\" /> Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of \"irregular\" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including [[Arnolt Schlick]]'s ''Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten'' ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.<ref name=Sachs299>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=299}}</ref> Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]], is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs301>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=301}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments \u2013 such as the violin \u2013 the \"classical shapes\" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.<ref name=Sachs302>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=302}}</ref> It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of ''consorts'', or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.<ref name=Sachs303>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=303}}</ref>\n\nInstrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with [[Organ stop|solo stops]] emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.<ref name=Sachs307>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=307}}</ref> Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used [[Mute (music)|mutes]] to properly blend into [[chamber music]].<ref name=Sachs328>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=328}}</ref>\n\n====Baroque====\n[[File:Stainer.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque]] mounted [[Jacob Stainer]] violin from 1658]]\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, composers began writing works to a higher emotional degree. They felt that [[Polyphony|polyphony]] better suited the emotional style they were aiming for and began writing musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.<ref name=Sachs351/> As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.<ref name=Sachs352>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=352}}</ref> Bowed instruments such as the violin, [[viola]], [[baryton]], and various lutes dominated popular music.<ref name=Sachs353>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=353\u2013357}}</ref> Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the [[guitar]].<ref name=Sachs374>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=374}}</ref> As the prevalence of [[string orchestra]]s rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.<ref name=Sachs380>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=380}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an \"art instrument\" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range. The details of this transformation are unclear, but the modern [[French horn|horn]] or, more colloquially, French horn, had emerged by 1725.<ref name=Sachs384>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=384}}</ref> The [[slide trumpet]] appeared, a variation that includes a long-throated mouthpiece that slid in and out, allowing the player infinite adjustments in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it.<ref name=Sachs385>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=385}}</ref> Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals.

The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.<ref name=Sachs388>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=388}}</ref>\n\nSome instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes\u2014most of them unsuccessful\u2014in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a \"defective\" range\u2014they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.<ref name=Sachs389>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=389}}</ref> New instruments such as the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], and [[tuba]] became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire \"families\" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.<ref name=Sachs388/>\n\nAccompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average [[concert pitch]] began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.<ref name=Sachs390>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=390}}</ref> Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge.

Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the [[Range (music)|range]] of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an [[orchestra]] or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.<ref name=Montagu210>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=210}}</ref> The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.<ref name=Montagu211>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=211}}</ref><ref name=Kartomi176>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=176}}</ref> The most common types of instrument classifications are [[String instrument|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n\n===Ancient systems===\nAn ancient Hindu system named the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written by the sage [[Bharata Muni]] and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and \"solid\", or non-skin, percussion instruments.<ref name=Montagu211/> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by [[Johannes de Muris]], who used the terms ''tensibilia'' (stringed instruments), ''inflatibilia'' (wind instruments), and ''percussibilia'' (all percussion instruments).<ref name=\"Rault190\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=190}}</ref> In 1880, [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] adapted the ''Natya Shastra'' and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: ''chordophones'' (stringed instruments), ''membranophones'' (skin-head percussion instruments), ''aerophones'' (wind instruments), and ''autophones'' (non-skin percussion instruments).<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\n===Hornbostel\u2013Sachs===\n[[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie'' in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term ''autophone'' with ''idiophone''.<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\nThe original [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] system classified instruments into four main groups:\n* [[Idiophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as [[claves]], [[xylophone]], [[guiro]], [[slit drum]], [[mbira]], and [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].<ref name=Marcuse3>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=3}}</ref>\n* [[Membranophone]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be [[drums]] (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but [[kazoos]] and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.<ref name=Marcuse117>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=117}}</ref>\n* [[Chordophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a [[zither]] whether it is plucked like an [[autoharp]] or struck with hammers like a [[piano]]. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a [[lute]], whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a [[guitar]] or uses a membrane like a [[banjo]].<ref name=Marcuse177>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=177}}</ref>\n* [[Aerophone]]s, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a [[bullroarer]] or [[whip]], which move freely through the air; reedless aerophones such as [[flute]]s and recorders, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed, including the clarinet and saxophone (this category may be further divided into two classifications: single-reeded and double-reeded instruments. The latter includes oboes and bassoons); and lip-vibrated aerophones such as [[trumpet]]s, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.<ref name=Marcuse549>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=549}}</ref>\n\nSachs later added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.<ref name=\"Sachs447\"/> Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].<ref name=\"Rault190\" /><ref name=\"Campbell39\">{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Schaeffner===\nAndre Schaeffner, a curator at the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme]], disagreed with the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel\u2013Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.<ref name=Kartomi174>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\n{{main|Range (music)}}\nMusical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.\n\nThese terms are named after singing voice classifications:\n* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[violin]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[piccolo]]\n* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto saxophone]], [[french horn]], [[english horn]], [[viola]], [[alto horn]]\n* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[guitar]], [[tenor drum]]\n* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]]\n* [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[contrabassoon]], [[bass saxophone]], [[tuba]], [[bass drum]]\n\nSome instruments fall into more than one category. For example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble. The trombone and French horn may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], [[alto flute]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example the [[sopranino saxophone]] and [[contrabass clarinet]]. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C<sub>3</sub> to F\u266f<sub>6</sub>, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:African music instrument made from a can 01.jpg|thumb|African [[Mbira|kalimba]] made from a food can]]\n<!--[[Musical instrument construction]] redirects directly here.-->\nThe materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]].<ref name=\"Rault184\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=184}}</ref> [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance\u2014instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The [[Yakuts]] believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.<ref name=\"Rault185\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=185}}</ref>\n\nMusical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a [[luthier]] makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Rault195\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=195}}</ref> Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop [[experimental musical instrument]]s, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder themself.\n\n==User interfaces==\n[[File:Usnaconsole2.jpg|thumb|The five-manual, 522-stop detached console at the [[Naval Academy Chapel|United States Naval Academy Chapel]] crafted by R.

Retrieved on 2008-03-04.</ref>]]\nRegardless of how the sound is produced, many musical instruments have a keyboard as the user interface. [[Keyboard instrument]]s are any instruments that are played with a [[musical keyboard]], which is a row of small keys that can be pressed. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means ([[Piano#Pedals|pedals]] for a piano, [[Organ stop|stops]] and a [[pedal keyboard]] for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned ([[organ (music)|organ]]) or pumped ([[accordion]]),<ref name=\"bicknell\">Bicknell, Stephen (1999). \"The organ case\".

The [[theremin]], an [[electrophone]], is played without physical contact by the player. The theremin senses the proximity of the player's hands, which triggers changes in its sound. More recently, a [[MIDI controller]] keyboard used with a [[digital audio workstation]] may have a musical keyboard and a bank of sliders, knobs, and buttons that change many sound parameters of a [[synthesizer]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of musical instruments]]\n* [[Folk instrument]]\n* [[Experimental musical instrument]]\n* [[Recording studio as an instrument]]\n* [[Music instrument technology]]\n* [[Orchestra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last=Baines |first=Anthony |title=Brass Instruments: Their History and Development |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-486-27574-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Bicknell |first=Stephen |title=The History of the English Organ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-65409-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Blades |first=James |title=Percussion Instruments and Their History |publisher=Bold Strummer Ltd |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-933224-61-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame }}\n* {{citation |last=Brown |first=Howard Mayer |title=Sachs, Curt |publisher=Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |year=2008 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/24256 |accessdate=5 June 2008}}\n* {{citation |last1=Campbell |first1=Murray |last2=Greated |first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers |first3=Arnold |title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-816504-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona }}\n* {{citation |last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Archeologists discover ice age dwellers' flute |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 December 2004 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/30/flute-prehistoric041230.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813200036/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/30/flute-prehistoric041230.html |archivedate=13 August 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2009}}\n* {{citation |last1=Chase |first1=Philip G. |last2=Nowell |first2=April |title=Taphonomy of a Suggested Middle Paleolithic Bone Flute from Slovenia |date=August\u2013October 1998 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=39 |issue=4 |page=549 |doi=10.1086/204771}}\n* {{citation |last=Collinson |first=Francis M. |title=The Bagpipe |publisher=Routledge |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7100-7913-8}}\n* {{citation |last=de Schauensee |first=Maude |title=Two Lyres from Ur |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-924171-88-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Grillet |first=Laurent |title=Les ancetres du violon v.1 |year=1901 |publisher=Paris}}\n* {{citation |last=Kartomi |first=Margaret J. |title=On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-42548-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Manning |first=Peter |title=Electronic and Computer Music |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-517085-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Marcuse |first=Sibyl |title=A Survey of Musical Instruments |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-06-012776-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/surveyofmusicali00marc }}\n* {{citation |last=Montagu |first=Jeremy |title=Origins and Development of Musical Instruments |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8108-5657-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Moorey |first=P.R.S. |title=What Do We Know About the People Buried in the Royal Cemetery? |journal=Expedition |volume=20 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=24\u201340}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pinch |first1=Revor |last2=Trocco |first2=Frank |title=Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-674-01617-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/analogdaysinvent00trev }}\n* {{citation |last=Rault |first=Lucie |title=Musical Instruments: A Worldwide Survey of Traditional Music-making |publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-500-51035-3}}\n* {{citation |last=Remnant |first=Mary |title=Musical Instruments: An Illustrated History from Antiquity to the Present |publisher=Batsford |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7134-5169-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen0000remn_h0w6 }}\n* {{citation |last=Sachs |first=Curt |title=The History of Musical Instruments |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-486-45265-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Slovenian Academy of Sciences |title=Early Music |date=11 April 1997 |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5310 |pages=203\u2013205 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5310.203g}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Wade-Matthews |first=Max |title=Musical Instruments: Illustrated Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/musicillustrated00wade |url-access=registration |publisher=Lorenz |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7548-1182-4}}\n* Music Library Association (1974).
