{"title_page": "Mass killings under communist regimes", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{communism sidebar}}\nSeveral [[mass killing]]s occurred under 20th-century [[communist regimes]]. Death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of deaths included. The higher estimates of mass killings account for crimes against civilians by governments, including executions, destruction of population through man-made hunger and deaths during forced deportations, imprisonment and through forced labor. Terms used to define these killings include \"mass killing\", \"[[democide]]\", \"[[politicide]]\", \"[[classicide]]\" and a broad definition of \"[[genocide]]\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{see also|Genocide definitions}}\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|pp=1320-1321}}{{efn|name=Krain terms 1997}}{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005}}{{efn|name=Karlsson terms 2008}}{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a}} and according to Professor Anton Weiss-Wendt there is no consensus in the field of comparative genocide studies on a definition of \"genocide\".{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008}} The following terminology has been used by individual authors to describe mass killings of unarmed civilians by [[communist state|communist governments]], individually or as a whole:\n* [[Genocide]] \u2013 under the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|crime of genocide]] generally applies to mass murder of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] rather than political or social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the [[United Nations]] resolution after a second vote because many states, including [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=137}} anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances.{{sfn|van Schaack|1997|pp=2259\u20122291}}{{sfn|Staub|2000|p=368}} \"Genocide\" is also a popular term for mass political killing, which is studied academically as \"democide\" and \"politicide\".{{sfn|Wayman|Tago|2009|pp=1-17}} Killing by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] has been labeled \"genocide\" or \"auto-genocide\" and the deaths under [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]] in the Soviet Union and [[Maoism]] in [[China]] have been controversially investigated as possible cases. In particular, the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine in the 1930s]] and the [[Great Chinese Famine|famine in China]] during the [[Great Leap Forward]] have been \"depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent\".{{efn|name=Williams terms 2008}}\n* [[Politicide]] \u2013 the term \"politicide\" is used to describe the killing of groups that would not otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention.{{sfn|Harff|Gurr|1988|pp=359-371}} Professor [[Barbara Harff]] studies \"genocide and politicide\", sometimes shortened as \"geno-politicide\", in order to include the killing of political, economic, ethnic and cultural groups.{{efn|name=Wayman terms 2009a}} Professor Manus I. Midlarsky uses the term \"politicide\" to describe an arc of large-scale killing from the western parts of the Soviet Union to China and Cambodia.{{efn|name=Midlarsky terms 2005}} In his book ''The Killing Trap: Genocide in the Twentieth Century'', Midlarsky raises similarities between the killings of Stalin and [[Pol Pot]].{{sfn|Midlarsky|2005|p=321}}\n* [[Holocaust (disambiguation)|Holocaust]] - The term \"communist holocaust\" has been used by some state officials and [[non-governmental organization]]s.{{sfn|US Congress|1993|p=15 at \u00a7905a1}}{{sfn|Rauch|2003}}{{sfn|Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation|2010}} The term \"red Holocaust\" was coined by the ''[[Institute of Contemporary History (Munich)|Munich Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]]''.{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009}}{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1999}} Professor [[Steven Rosefielde]] used \"Red Holocaust\" for communist \"peacetime state killings\", while stating that it \"could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.\"{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010}} According to J\u00f6rg Hackmann, this term is not popular among scholars in Germany or internationally.{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009}} [[Alexandra Laignel-Lavastine]] writes that usage of this term \"allows the reality it describes to immediately attain, in the Western mind, a status equal to that of the [[Final Solution|extermination of the Jews]] by the [[Nazi regime]]\".{{efn|name=Shafir terms 2016}}{{sfn|Rousso|Goslan|2004|p=157}} Michael Shafir writes that the use of the term supports the \"competitive martyrdom component of Double Genocide\", a theory whose worst version is [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] obfuscation.{{sfn|Shafir|2016|pp=64, 74}} George Voicu states that Leon Volovici has \"rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to 'usurp' and undermine a symbol specific to the history of [[European Jews]].\"{{efn|name=Voicu terms 2018}}\n* [[Democide]] \u2013 Professor [[R.

It had its revealed text and its chief interpreters. It had its priests and their ritualistic prose with all the answers. It had a heaven, and the proper behavior to reach it. It had its appeal to faith. And it had its crusades against nonbelievers.

And, thus, this war for the communist utopia had its necessary enemy casualties, the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, wreckers, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, rich, landlords, and noncombatants that unfortunately got caught in the battle. In a war millions may die, but the cause may be well justified, as in the defeat of Hitler and an utterly racist Nazism.

First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to [[economic collapse]], [[epidemic]]s, and, most important, widespread famines. [...] The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations.

The literatures on state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism have been plagued by definitional problems. Terms such as state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism can be (and often are) easily confused and therefore need elaboration. The main difference between state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism, for instance, is one of intentionality. The purpose behind policies of state-sponsored mass murder such as genocide or politicide is to eliminate an entire group (Gurr 1986, 67). The purpose behind policies of state terrorism is to \"induce sharp fear and through that agency to effect a desired outcome in a conflict situation\" (Gurr 1986, 46). The former requires mass killings to accomplish its goal. The latter's success is dependent on the persuasiveness of the fear tactics used. Mass killings may not be necessary to accomplish the particular goal.\" ... \"2. Genocides are mass killings in which the victim group is defined by association with a particular communal group. Politicides are mass killings in which \"victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups\" (Harff and Gurr 1988, 360). Interestingly, many of the instances coded by Harff and Gurr as \"politicide\" are considered by much of the literature to be instances of state terrorism (e.g., Argentina, Chile, El Salvador) (Lopez 1984, 63). Evidently there is some overlap between state terrorism and some kinds of state-sponsored mass murder.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005\n|{{harvnb|Valentino|2005|p=9}}: \"Mass killing and Genocide.

In addition, it is not in keeping with the terms that have long been used by the academic community. Naturally, the work of creating an inventory includes examining the terms used in practice by researchers in their analyses, and it is reasonable to assume that every time, every society and every paradigm has its own terms to refer to the crimes of communist regimes. Nonetheless, it is possible to establish at this early stage that researchers have long used the word terror to describe the crimes of the Soviet communist regime, regardless of the framework of interpretation to which they adhere. Although the extent to which the mass operations and forced deportations of specific ethnic groups ordered by Stalin before and during the Second World War can be defined as genocide is debated, there is agreement among researchers that the term \u2018terror\u2019 is the best reflection of the development of violence in Bolshevik Russia and in the communist Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin. As a result, terror will be the term most frequently used here in analysing the Soviet communist criminal history. On the other hand, the term terror is seldom used to describe the mass killings in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, which may be because it is less clear that the actual intention and stated motive of the Khmer Rouge was to terrorise people into submission. The term genocide, however, is relatively widely accepted and established in describing the systematic and selective crimes of the communist regime in Cambodia, although the use of this term is not entirely uncontroversial. Therefore, in analysing the criminal history of Cambodia, this term will be used in precise contexts dealing with the killing of a category of people, whereas more neutral terms such as mass killing and massacre are used to refer to the general use of violence. The terminology used in the Chinese criminal history is dealt with in detail as part of the section on China.\" ... \"In the Soviet case, as Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson so rightly notes, there is an \u2018established term\u2019 for the crimes of the regime, namely \u2018terror\u2019 \u2013 and this is used almost regardless of the general frameworks of interpretation employed by individual researchers. In the same way, he notes that \u2018the term genocide is established and accepted as a description of the crimes of the Khmer Rouge\u2019. In the case of the People\u2019s Republic of China, however, there are no equivalent terms that are accepted or generally established in the academic community and that can be made use of in a research inventory. Bibliographies and search engines all speak their own clear language: those who carried out research on Maoism in its day made very limited use of words such as terror and genocide, and neither do these terms appear among the key terms that carry implicit clear explanations and are therefore regularly used by current foreign and Chinese historians.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Semelin|2009|p=318}}: \"'Classicide', in counterpoint to genocide, has a certain appeal, but it doesn't convey the fact that communist regimes, beyond their intention of destroying 'classes' - a difficult notion to grasp in itself (what exactly is a 'kulak'?) - end up making political suspicion a rule of government: even within the Party (and perhaps even mainly within the Party). The notion of 'fratricide' is probably more appropriate in this regard. That of 'politicide', which Ted Gurr and Barbara Harff suggest, remains the most intelligent, although it implies by contrast that 'genocide' is not 'political', which is debatable. These authors in effect explain that the aim of politicide is to impose total political domination over a group or a government. Its victims are defined by their position in the social hierarchy or their political opposition to the regime or this dominant group. Such an approach applies well to the political violence of communist powers and more particularly to Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea. The French historian Henri Locard in fact emphasises this, identifying with Gurr and Harff's approach in his work on Cambodia. However, the term 'politicide' has little currency among some researchers because it has no legal validity in international law. That is one reason why Jean-Louis Margolin tends to recognise what happened in Cambodia as 'genocide' because, as he points out, to speak of 'politicide' amounts to considering Pol Pot's crimes as less grave than those of Hitler. Again, the weight of justice interferes in the debate about concepts that, once again, argue strongly in favour of using the word genocide. But those so concerned about the issue of legal sanctions should also take into account another legal concept that is just as powerful, and better established: that of crime against humanity. In fact, legal scholars such as Antoine Garapon and David Boyle believe that the violence perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge is much more appropriately categorised under the heading of crime against humanity, even if genocidal tendencies can be identified, particularly against the Muslim minority. This accusation is just as serious as that of genocide (the latter moreover being sometimes considered as a subcategory of the former) and should thus be subject to equally severe sentences. I quite agree with these legal scholars, believing that the notion of 'crime against humanity' is generally better suited to the violence perpetrated by communist regimes, a viewpoint shared by Michael Mann.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Weiss-Wendt|2008|p=42}}: \"The field of comparative genocide studies has grown beyond recognition over the past two decades, though more quantitatively than qualitatively.

If we are talking numbers, comparative genocide studies are indeed a success. Upon closer examination, however, genocide scholarship is ridden with contradictions. There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole.

Most vulnerable minorities around the world ''had'' been so defined when Lemkin was crafting his genocide framework, and when UN member states were drafting the Genocide Convention. Such groups continued to be targeted in the post-Second World War period, as in East Pakistan/ Bangladesh in 1971, or Guatemala between 1978 and 1984. But it became increasingly apparent that ''political'' groups were on the receiving end of some of the worst campaigns of mass killing, such as the devastating assault on the Indonesian Communist Party in 1965\u20141966 (with half a million to one million killed), and the brutal campaigns by Latin American and Asian military regimes against perceived dissidents in the 1970s and 1980s. \nOne result of this re-evaluation was that the mass killing by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, previously ruled out as genocide or designated an 'auto-genocide' because most victims belonged to the same ethnic-Khmer group as their killers, came to be accepted as a classic instance of twentieth-century genocide. Detailed investigations were also launched into the hecatombs of casualties inflicted under Leninism and Stalinism in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, and by Mao Zedong's communists in China. In both of these cases\u2014and to some degree in Cambodia as well\u2014the majority of deaths resulted not from direct execution, but from the infliction of 'conditions of life calculated to bring about [the] physical destruction' of a group, in the language of Article II(c) of the Genocide Convention. In particular, the devastating famines that struck the Ukraine and other minority regions of the USSR in the early 1930s, and the even greater death-toll\u2014numbering tens of millions\u2014caused by famine during Mao's 'Great Leap Forward' (1958\u20141962), were increasingly, though not uncontroversially, depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Wayman terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Wayman|Tago|2009|pp=1-17}}: \"The two important scholars who have created datasets related to this are Rummel (1995) and Harff (2003).

Rummel (1994, 1995) has a very similar concept, 'democide', which includes such genocide and geno-politicide done by the government forces, plus other killing by government forces, such as random killing not targeted at a particular group. As Rummel (1995: 3-4) says, 'Cold-blooded government killing ... extends beyond genocide'; For example, 'shooting political opponents; or murdering by quota'. Hence, 'to cover all such murder as well as genocide and politicide, I use the concept democide. This is the intentional killing of people by government' (Rummel, 1995: 4).

Although genocide can be understood to be a species of politicide (but not the converse), in practice, genocidal (i.e., ethnoreligious) killings tap into much deeper historical roots of the human condition. In this distinction, I follow Harff and Gurr 1988, 360.\" ... \"Turning to Cambodia, the mass killings in that country during Pol Pot's murderous regime are often characterized with other seemingly identical circumstances. Cambodia and Rwanda, for example, are typically treated as genocides that differ little from each other in essential characteristics. However, the victimization rates for the two countries are similar only when treated as proportions of the ''total'' country population systematically murdered. Although the mass murders in Cambodia are frequently characterized as genocide, I argue that in fact genocidal activity was only a small proportion of the killing and that the vast majority of Cambodians died in a politicide, substantially different in origin from the genocides we have been examining. The matter of etiology lies at the root of my distinction here, not definitional semantics. If we lump the Cambodian case other instances of systematized mass murder, then the sources of all of them become hopelessly muddled.\" ... \"Essentially, I argue that genocides stem from a primitive identification of the \"collective enemy\" in Carl Schmitt's sense, whereas politicides, at least of the Cambodian variety, are attributable to more detailed ideological considerations. Further, the Cambodian case falls under the rubric of state killings, having a particular affinity with earlier practices in the Soviet Union and China. Indeed, an arc of Communist politicide can be traced from the western portions of the Soviet Union to China and on to Cambodia. Not all Communist states participated in extensive politicide, but the particular circumstances of Cambodia in 1975 lent themselves to the commission of systematic mass murder. Because an element of Cambodian state insecurity existed in this period, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Vietnam, a genocidal element is found in the killing of non-Khmer peoples such as the Vietnamese, who comprised a small proportion of the total.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009\n|{{harvnb|Hackmann|2009}}: \"A coining of communism as \u201cred Holocaust,\u201d as had been suggested by the Munich Institut fur Zeitgeschichte, did not find much ground, neither in Germany nor elsewhere in international discussions.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=3}}: \"The Red Holocaust could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.

It also excludes deaths attributable to wartime hostilities after states were founded. As a matter of accounting, the convention excludes Soviet killings before 1929, during World War II (1940-45) and in Germany, occupied Europe, North Korea, Manchuria and the Kuril Islands (1946-53). Killings in China before October 1949 are similarly excluded, as are those in Indochina before 1954. Soviet slaughter of nobles, kulaks, capitalist and the bourgeoisie during War Communism are part of the excluded wartime group, but killings of similar social categories in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia after their civil wars in the process of Communist consolidation are included.

Leon Volovici rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to \"usurp\" and undermine a symbol specific to the history of European Jews. As many of those who use the term \"red Holocaust\" (and other terms along the same lines, such as \"the Holocaust of Romanian culture\" and \"the Holocaust of Romanian people\") do so with antisemitic rancor, claiming that the authors of this \"Holocaust\" are none other than the Jews, the reason for the hijacking of the term becomes clear: to place the blame on Jews and to manufacture an alternate history.\nIt should be noted that the intelligentsia at the top of Romanian culture does not use the expression \"red Holocaust\" systematically, but rather accidentally.

The 'massive number' he selects as the threshold to mass killing is 'at least fifty thousand intentional deaths over the course of five or fewer years' (Valentino, 2004: 11-12), which of course averages to at least 10,000 killed per year.\" ... \" One reason for selecting these thresholds of 10,000 and 1,000 deaths per year is that we find that in the Harff data on geno-politicide, which are one of our key datasets, there are many cases of over 10,000 killed per year, but also some in which between 1,000 and 10,000 are killed per year. Therefore, analyzing at a 1,000-death threshold (as well as the 10,000 threshold) insures the inclusion of all the Harff cases.

Finlay (''ibid.'' p. 378) argues that this is done by 'undermining existing moral norms and suggesting that new ones will be created to suit a new proletarian order.' Marx argues that norms and ethics are determined by the dominating class of the time, as can be illustrated in Lenin's statement that 'Honesty is a bourgeoisie virtue', meaning that honesty is crucial to the existence of bourgeoisie, as other virtues such as loyalty and obedience were necessary virtues during the reign of the feudal aristocracy. This impacts the concept of justice in war dramatically.\nAs there is the assumption that a new social order is to be created, along with a new set of moral and ethical codes, then the current ones may be discarded. Therefore, Finley (''ibid.'') states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the proletariat. Finley also addresses an alternative opinion, that of Shlomo Avineri, who believes that this may be a non-issue when one takes into account the universality of the proletariat. This universality means that it has no active class-based or sectarian interest, or, rather, that its interests represent those of all society. Its major interest is simply to 'eliminate all other special interests on the basis of which it suffers oppression' and is an entirely negative entirely (''ibid.'', p. 379). Therefore, our conception of ethics and morality - the product of a capitalist society - is inaccurate. Being based on the interest of the bourgeoisie rather than a true and authentic reflection of the ethics of a universal class, its contravention is not something to be lamented. Finley understands Avineri as drawing two conclusions. First, that: \n:whatever the bourgeoisie with its individualistic and legalistic conception of political ethics and legality has to say about the morality of violence is likely to be invalid since it reflects the particular class interests and therefore the perverted humanism of its proponents. (''Ibid.'', p. 370)\nand, moreover, that only ethical claims of the proletariat are valid, insofar as they are the true reflections of 'the perspective of the last social class, at its final revolutionary stage of oppression' (''ibid.''). It is only then that morals and ethics can be created authentically, and all other systems ought to be considered as arbitrary. However, this creates a major difficulty for Finlay and, as Marx has inspired many other theorists (\u017di\u017eek, Fanon, Sorel, etc.) this is a difficulty which he identifies in each of their works as well.\nUnderstanding that revolutionary violence is carried out in the hope of future absolution based on a hypothetical social order able to craft a universal system of ethics, Finlay sees this as ''carte blanche'' for revolutionists to carry out any action, however atrocious, so long as it helps bring about this imminent revolution. Finlay's 'permissive doctrine' is a 'philosophical framework within which the possibility of using violence is validated but without setting any clear limits to how much violence can be used and against whom'. Finlay also argue that there is a tendency for excess, as Fanon, Sorel and \u017di\u017eek all see the use of violence as beneficial, since it may act as a spark for the revolution. Finlay sees the total legitimation of violence in revolution, with no principle of restriction, to be both dangerous and unethical.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Singh motive 2014\n|{{harvnb|Jahanbegloo|2014|pp=120-121}}: \"Singh makes a principled argument: that Marx saw the use of violence, even when it is avoidable, as required insofar as that it has a purging quality, believing that only by using violence can all elements of the previous regime be eradicated. Moreover, Singh (''ibid.'', p. 14) considers Marx's references to the use of bourgeoisie democratic institutions to bring about social change only as 'hinting to the possibility of the working class coming into power, in England, through universal suffrage'. Furthermore, he quotes Engels in a letter addressed to the Communist Committee in Brussels in October 1846. In this letter, Engels states that there cannot be any means of carrying out the communist agenda 'other than a democratic revolution by force' (''ibid.'' p. 10). Singh, however, does acknowledge the desire in Marx to avoid a bloody revolution.\nSingh (''ibid.'' p. 11) notes that most Marxist writing that alluded to the possibility of this transition being carried out peacefully took place before the events of 1844-48, which 'showed that a peaceful change was not even remotely possible'. After 1848, Singh notes a return to advocating a violent revolution due to what Singh identifies as the 'practical considerations' of being unable to overcome the existing obstacles to a peaceful transition. Singh (''ibid.'' p. 13) writes that, in 1848, Marx published an article titled ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm The Victory of Counter-Revolution in Vienna]'', where he states 'there is only one means by which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated - and that is by revolutionary terror'.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Magyar essay 1849\n|[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm ''The Magyar Struggle'']: \"Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality \u2014 the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars.

Such, in Scotland, are the Gaels, the supporters of the Stuarts from 1640 to 1745. Such, in France, are the Bretons, the supporters of the Bourbons from 1792 to 1800.

But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.

Dread of political and economic pollution by the survival of antagonistic classes has been for the most extreme communist leaders what fear of racial pollution was for Hitler. There, also, material explanations fail to address the extent of the killings, gruesome tortures, fantastic trails, and attempts to wipe out whole categories of people that occurred in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot's Cambodia. The revolutionary thinkers who formed and led communist regimes were not just ordinary intellectuals. They had to be fanatics in the true sense of that word. They were so certain of their ideas that no evidence to the contrary could change their minds. Those who came to doubt the rightness of their ways were eliminated, or never achieved power. The element of religious certitude found in prophetic movements was as important as their Marxist science in sustaining the notion that their vision of socialism could be made to work. This justified the ruthless dehumanization of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction. The logic of the situation in times of crisis then demanded that these 'bad elements' (as they were called in Maoist China) be killed, deported, or relegated to a permanently inferior status. That is very close to saying that the community of God, or the racially pure volksgemeinschaft could only be guaranteed if the corrupting elements within it were eliminated (Courtois et al. 1999).\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Mann motive 2005\n|{{harvnb|Mann|2005|pp=318, 321}}: \"All accounts of 20th-century mass murder include the Communist regimes.

These saw themselves as belonging to a single socialist family, and all referred to a Marxist tradition of development theory. They murderously cleansed in similar ways, though to different degrees. Later regimes consciously adapted their practices to the perceived successes and failures of earlier ones. The Khmer Rouge used China and the Soviet Union (and Vietnam and North Korea) as reference societies, while China used the Soviet Union. All addressed the same basic problem - how to apply a revolutionary vision of a future industrial society to a present agrarian one.

The ideological conviction of leaders promoting such a political scheme is thus decisive. Nevertheless, it would be far too simplistic an interpretation to assume that the sole purpose of inflicting these various forms of violence on civilians could only aim at instilling a climate of terror in this 'new society'. In fact, they are part of a broader whole, i.e. the spectrum of social engineering techniques implememted in order to transform a society completely. There can be no doubt that it is this utopia of a classless society which drives that kind of revolutionary project. The plan for political and social reshaping will thus logically claim victims in all strata of society. And through this process, communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political imaginaire.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde motive 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=xvi}}: \"The story that emerges from the exercise is edifying.

Yet her encounter with the Gulag medical-sanitary service's Moscow archive \"surprised\" Alexopoulos (1), and she now attempts to challenge the emergent scholarly consensus, with uneven success.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Governments USSR famine\n|{{harvnb|BBC|2008b}}: \"\u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0456\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 19-\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443, \u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u0491\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0439 \u0415\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0456\u044f \u0443\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0456 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0435.\" (translation: Latvia became the 19th country in the world that recognized the Holodomor as the genocide of the Ukrainian people.

Free-fire zones were established in depopulated areas, permitting Soviet troops to shoot anything that moved. In addition to killing tens of thousands in attacks on villages, this policy eventually produced one of the most massive refugee movements in modern history. Approximately 5 million people out of a total prewar population of between 15.5 and 17 million had fled the country by the early 1990s, the great majority across the border to Pakistan.

Such arguments in no way detract from the unique nature of Auschwitz - the mobilization of leading-edge technological resources and their use in an \"industrial process\" involving the construction of an \"extermination factory,\" the use of gas, and cremation. However, this argument highlights one particular feature of many Communist regimes - their systematic use of famine as a weapon. The regime aimed to control the total available food supply and, with immense ingenuity, to distribute food purely on the basis of \"merits\" and \"demerits\" earned by individuals. This policy was a recipe for creating famine on a massive scale. Remember that in the period after 1918, only Communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people. And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist-Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\"\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=The Gulag's Veiled Mortality|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/gulags-veiled-mortality-golfo-alexopoulos|date=January 7, 2013|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag|date=April 25, 2017|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-17941-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSSMDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55750-670-2}}\n* {{citation|last=Amstutz|first=Mark R.|title=International ethics: concepts, theories, and cases in global politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qTYko_PygLYC&pg=PA96&dq=mass+killing+communism#v=onepage&q=starvation%20of%205%20million%20Ukrainian%20peasants&f=false|edition=2nd|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3583-1}}\n* {{citation|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00313-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eSR1rHg5_YC&pg=PA457&dq=half+a+million+Red+Terror+of+1977+and+1978}}\n* {{citation|last=Andjelic|first=Neven|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy|publisher=Frank Cass|year=2003|page=36|isbn=0-7146-5485-X}}\n* {{citation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|title=The Worst of the Madness|publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/worst-madness/?pagination=false}}\n* {{citation|last=Aronson|first=Ronald|title=Review: Communism's Posthumous Trial.

It had its appeal to faith. And it had its crusades against nonbelievers.

First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to [[economic collapse]], [[epidemic]]s, and, most important, widespread famines. [...] The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations.

The literatures on state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism have been plagued by definitional problems. Terms such as state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism can be (and often are) easily confused and therefore need elaboration. The main difference between state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism, for instance, is one of intentionality. The purpose behind policies of state-sponsored mass murder such as genocide or politicide is to eliminate an entire group (Gurr 1986, 67). The purpose behind policies of state terrorism is to \"induce sharp fear and through that agency to effect a desired outcome in a conflict situation\" (Gurr 1986, 46). The former requires mass killings to accomplish its goal. The latter's success is dependent on the persuasiveness of the fear tactics used. Mass killings may not be necessary to accomplish the particular goal.\" ... \"2. Genocides are mass killings in which the victim group is defined by association with a particular communal group. Politicides are mass killings in which \"victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups\" (Harff and Gurr 1988, 360). Interestingly, many of the instances coded by Harff and Gurr as \"politicide\" are considered by much of the literature to be instances of state terrorism (e.g., Argentina, Chile, El Salvador) (Lopez 1984, 63). Evidently there is some overlap between state terrorism and some kinds of state-sponsored mass murder.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005\n|{{harvnb|Valentino|2005|p=9}}: \"Mass killing and Genocide.

In addition, it is not in keeping with the terms that have long been used by the academic community. Naturally, the work of creating an inventory includes examining the terms used in practice by researchers in their analyses, and it is reasonable to assume that every time, every society and every paradigm has its own terms to refer to the crimes of communist regimes. Nonetheless, it is possible to establish at this early stage that researchers have long used the word terror to describe the crimes of the Soviet communist regime, regardless of the framework of interpretation to which they adhere. Although the extent to which the mass operations and forced deportations of specific ethnic groups ordered by Stalin before and during the Second World War can be defined as genocide is debated, there is agreement among researchers that the term \u2018terror\u2019 is the best reflection of the development of violence in Bolshevik Russia and in the communist Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin. As a result, terror will be the term most frequently used here in analysing the Soviet communist criminal history. On the other hand, the term terror is seldom used to describe the mass killings in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, which may be because it is less clear that the actual intention and stated motive of the Khmer Rouge was to terrorise people into submission. The term genocide, however, is relatively widely accepted and established in describing the systematic and selective crimes of the communist regime in Cambodia, although the use of this term is not entirely uncontroversial. Therefore, in analysing the criminal history of Cambodia, this term will be used in precise contexts dealing with the killing of a category of people, whereas more neutral terms such as mass killing and massacre are used to refer to the general use of violence. The terminology used in the Chinese criminal history is dealt with in detail as part of the section on China.\" ... \"In the Soviet case, as Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson so rightly notes, there is an \u2018established term\u2019 for the crimes of the regime, namely \u2018terror\u2019 \u2013 and this is used almost regardless of the general frameworks of interpretation employed by individual researchers. In the same way, he notes that \u2018the term genocide is established and accepted as a description of the crimes of the Khmer Rouge\u2019. In the case of the People\u2019s Republic of China, however, there are no equivalent terms that are accepted or generally established in the academic community and that can be made use of in a research inventory. Bibliographies and search engines all speak their own clear language: those who carried out research on Maoism in its day made very limited use of words such as terror and genocide, and neither do these terms appear among the key terms that carry implicit clear explanations and are therefore regularly used by current foreign and Chinese historians.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Semelin|2009|p=318}}: \"'Classicide', in counterpoint to genocide, has a certain appeal, but it doesn't convey the fact that communist regimes, beyond their intention of destroying 'classes' - a difficult notion to grasp in itself (what exactly is a 'kulak'?) - end up making political suspicion a rule of government: even within the Party (and perhaps even mainly within the Party). The notion of 'fratricide' is probably more appropriate in this regard. That of 'politicide', which Ted Gurr and Barbara Harff suggest, remains the most intelligent, although it implies by contrast that 'genocide' is not 'political', which is debatable. These authors in effect explain that the aim of politicide is to impose total political domination over a group or a government. Its victims are defined by their position in the social hierarchy or their political opposition to the regime or this dominant group. Such an approach applies well to the political violence of communist powers and more particularly to Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea. The French historian Henri Locard in fact emphasises this, identifying with Gurr and Harff's approach in his work on Cambodia. However, the term 'politicide' has little currency among some researchers because it has no legal validity in international law. That is one reason why Jean-Louis Margolin tends to recognise what happened in Cambodia as 'genocide' because, as he points out, to speak of 'politicide' amounts to considering Pol Pot's crimes as less grave than those of Hitler. Again, the weight of justice interferes in the debate about concepts that, once again, argue strongly in favour of using the word genocide. But those so concerned about the issue of legal sanctions should also take into account another legal concept that is just as powerful, and better established: that of crime against humanity. In fact, legal scholars such as Antoine Garapon and David Boyle believe that the violence perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge is much more appropriately categorised under the heading of crime against humanity, even if genocidal tendencies can be identified, particularly against the Muslim minority. This accusation is just as serious as that of genocide (the latter moreover being sometimes considered as a subcategory of the former) and should thus be subject to equally severe sentences. I quite agree with these legal scholars, believing that the notion of 'crime against humanity' is generally better suited to the violence perpetrated by communist regimes, a viewpoint shared by Michael Mann.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Weiss-Wendt|2008|p=42}}: \"The field of comparative genocide studies has grown beyond recognition over the past two decades, though more quantitatively than qualitatively.

If we are talking numbers, comparative genocide studies are indeed a success. Upon closer examination, however, genocide scholarship is ridden with contradictions. There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole.

Most vulnerable minorities around the world ''had'' been so defined when Lemkin was crafting his genocide framework, and when UN member states were drafting the Genocide Convention. Such groups continued to be targeted in the post-Second World War period, as in East Pakistan/ Bangladesh in 1971, or Guatemala between 1978 and 1984. But it became increasingly apparent that ''political'' groups were on the receiving end of some of the worst campaigns of mass killing, such as the devastating assault on the Indonesian Communist Party in 1965\u20141966 (with half a million to one million killed), and the brutal campaigns by Latin American and Asian military regimes against perceived dissidents in the 1970s and 1980s. \nOne result of this re-evaluation was that the mass killing by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, previously ruled out as genocide or designated an 'auto-genocide' because most victims belonged to the same ethnic-Khmer group as their killers, came to be accepted as a classic instance of twentieth-century genocide. Detailed investigations were also launched into the hecatombs of casualties inflicted under Leninism and Stalinism in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, and by Mao Zedong's communists in China. In both of these cases\u2014and to some degree in Cambodia as well\u2014the majority of deaths resulted not from direct execution, but from the infliction of 'conditions of life calculated to bring about [the] physical destruction' of a group, in the language of Article II(c) of the Genocide Convention. In particular, the devastating famines that struck the Ukraine and other minority regions of the USSR in the early 1930s, and the even greater death-toll\u2014numbering tens of millions\u2014caused by famine during Mao's 'Great Leap Forward' (1958\u20141962), were increasingly, though not uncontroversially, depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Wayman terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Wayman|Tago|2009|pp=1-17}}: \"The two important scholars who have created datasets related to this are Rummel (1995) and Harff (2003).

Rummel (1994, 1995) has a very similar concept, 'democide', which includes such genocide and geno-politicide done by the government forces, plus other killing by government forces, such as random killing not targeted at a particular group. As Rummel (1995: 3-4) says, 'Cold-blooded government killing ... extends beyond genocide'; For example, 'shooting political opponents; or murdering by quota'. Hence, 'to cover all such murder as well as genocide and politicide, I use the concept democide. This is the intentional killing of people by government' (Rummel, 1995: 4).

Although genocide can be understood to be a species of politicide (but not the converse), in practice, genocidal (i.e., ethnoreligious) killings tap into much deeper historical roots of the human condition. In this distinction, I follow Harff and Gurr 1988, 360.\" ... \"Turning to Cambodia, the mass killings in that country during Pol Pot's murderous regime are often characterized with other seemingly identical circumstances. Cambodia and Rwanda, for example, are typically treated as genocides that differ little from each other in essential characteristics. However, the victimization rates for the two countries are similar only when treated as proportions of the ''total'' country population systematically murdered. Although the mass murders in Cambodia are frequently characterized as genocide, I argue that in fact genocidal activity was only a small proportion of the killing and that the vast majority of Cambodians died in a politicide, substantially different in origin from the genocides we have been examining. The matter of etiology lies at the root of my distinction here, not definitional semantics. If we lump the Cambodian case other instances of systematized mass murder, then the sources of all of them become hopelessly muddled.\" ... \"Essentially, I argue that genocides stem from a primitive identification of the \"collective enemy\" in Carl Schmitt's sense, whereas politicides, at least of the Cambodian variety, are attributable to more detailed ideological considerations. Further, the Cambodian case falls under the rubric of state killings, having a particular affinity with earlier practices in the Soviet Union and China. Indeed, an arc of Communist politicide can be traced from the western portions of the Soviet Union to China and on to Cambodia. Not all Communist states participated in extensive politicide, but the particular circumstances of Cambodia in 1975 lent themselves to the commission of systematic mass murder. Because an element of Cambodian state insecurity existed in this period, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Vietnam, a genocidal element is found in the killing of non-Khmer peoples such as the Vietnamese, who comprised a small proportion of the total.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009\n|{{harvnb|Hackmann|2009}}: \"A coining of communism as \u201cred Holocaust,\u201d as had been suggested by the Munich Institut fur Zeitgeschichte, did not find much ground, neither in Germany nor elsewhere in international discussions.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=3}}: \"The Red Holocaust could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.

It also excludes deaths attributable to wartime hostilities after states were founded. As a matter of accounting, the convention excludes Soviet killings before 1929, during World War II (1940-45) and in Germany, occupied Europe, North Korea, Manchuria and the Kuril Islands (1946-53). Killings in China before October 1949 are similarly excluded, as are those in Indochina before 1954. Soviet slaughter of nobles, kulaks, capitalist and the bourgeoisie during War Communism are part of the excluded wartime group, but killings of similar social categories in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia after their civil wars in the process of Communist consolidation are included.

Leon Volovici rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to \"usurp\" and undermine a symbol specific to the history of European Jews. As many of those who use the term \"red Holocaust\" (and other terms along the same lines, such as \"the Holocaust of Romanian culture\" and \"the Holocaust of Romanian people\") do so with antisemitic rancor, claiming that the authors of this \"Holocaust\" are none other than the Jews, the reason for the hijacking of the term becomes clear: to place the blame on Jews and to manufacture an alternate history.\nIt should be noted that the intelligentsia at the top of Romanian culture does not use the expression \"red Holocaust\" systematically, but rather accidentally.

The 'massive number' he selects as the threshold to mass killing is 'at least fifty thousand intentional deaths over the course of five or fewer years' (Valentino, 2004: 11-12), which of course averages to at least 10,000 killed per year.\" ... \" One reason for selecting these thresholds of 10,000 and 1,000 deaths per year is that we find that in the Harff data on geno-politicide, which are one of our key datasets, there are many cases of over 10,000 killed per year, but also some in which between 1,000 and 10,000 are killed per year. Therefore, analyzing at a 1,000-death threshold (as well as the 10,000 threshold) insures the inclusion of all the Harff cases.

Finlay (''ibid.'' p. 378) argues that this is done by 'undermining existing moral norms and suggesting that new ones will be created to suit a new proletarian order.' Marx argues that norms and ethics are determined by the dominating class of the time, as can be illustrated in Lenin's statement that 'Honesty is a bourgeoisie virtue', meaning that honesty is crucial to the existence of bourgeoisie, as other virtues such as loyalty and obedience were necessary virtues during the reign of the feudal aristocracy. This impacts the concept of justice in war dramatically.\nAs there is the assumption that a new social order is to be created, along with a new set of moral and ethical codes, then the current ones may be discarded. Therefore, Finley (''ibid.'') states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the proletariat. Finley also addresses an alternative opinion, that of Shlomo Avineri, who believes that this may be a non-issue when one takes into account the universality of the proletariat. This universality means that it has no active class-based or sectarian interest, or, rather, that its interests represent those of all society. Its major interest is simply to 'eliminate all other special interests on the basis of which it suffers oppression' and is an entirely negative entirely (''ibid.'', p. 379). Therefore, our conception of ethics and morality - the product of a capitalist society - is inaccurate. Being based on the interest of the bourgeoisie rather than a true and authentic reflection of the ethics of a universal class, its contravention is not something to be lamented. Finley understands Avineri as drawing two conclusions. First, that: \n:whatever the bourgeoisie with its individualistic and legalistic conception of political ethics and legality has to say about the morality of violence is likely to be invalid since it reflects the particular class interests and therefore the perverted humanism of its proponents. (''Ibid.'', p. 370)\nand, moreover, that only ethical claims of the proletariat are valid, insofar as they are the true reflections of 'the perspective of the last social class, at its final revolutionary stage of oppression' (''ibid.''). It is only then that morals and ethics can be created authentically, and all other systems ought to be considered as arbitrary. However, this creates a major difficulty for Finlay and, as Marx has inspired many other theorists (\u017di\u017eek, Fanon, Sorel, etc.) this is a difficulty which he identifies in each of their works as well.\nUnderstanding that revolutionary violence is carried out in the hope of future absolution based on a hypothetical social order able to craft a universal system of ethics, Finlay sees this as ''carte blanche'' for revolutionists to carry out any action, however atrocious, so long as it helps bring about this imminent revolution. Finlay's 'permissive doctrine' is a 'philosophical framework within which the possibility of using violence is validated but without setting any clear limits to how much violence can be used and against whom'. Finlay also argue that there is a tendency for excess, as Fanon, Sorel and \u017di\u017eek all see the use of violence as beneficial, since it may act as a spark for the revolution. Finlay sees the total legitimation of violence in revolution, with no principle of restriction, to be both dangerous and unethical.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Singh motive 2014\n|{{harvnb|Jahanbegloo|2014|pp=120-121}}: \"Singh makes a principled argument: that Marx saw the use of violence, even when it is avoidable, as required insofar as that it has a purging quality, believing that only by using violence can all elements of the previous regime be eradicated. Moreover, Singh (''ibid.'', p. 14) considers Marx's references to the use of bourgeoisie democratic institutions to bring about social change only as 'hinting to the possibility of the working class coming into power, in England, through universal suffrage'. Furthermore, he quotes Engels in a letter addressed to the Communist Committee in Brussels in October 1846. In this letter, Engels states that there cannot be any means of carrying out the communist agenda 'other than a democratic revolution by force' (''ibid.'' p. 10). Singh, however, does acknowledge the desire in Marx to avoid a bloody revolution.\nSingh (''ibid.'' p. 11) notes that most Marxist writing that alluded to the possibility of this transition being carried out peacefully took place before the events of 1844-48, which 'showed that a peaceful change was not even remotely possible'. After 1848, Singh notes a return to advocating a violent revolution due to what Singh identifies as the 'practical considerations' of being unable to overcome the existing obstacles to a peaceful transition. Singh (''ibid.'' p. 13) writes that, in 1848, Marx published an article titled ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm The Victory of Counter-Revolution in Vienna]'', where he states 'there is only one means by which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated - and that is by revolutionary terror'.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Magyar essay 1849\n|[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm ''The Magyar Struggle'']: \"Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality \u2014 the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars.

Such, in Scotland, are the Gaels, the supporters of the Stuarts from 1640 to 1745. Such, in France, are the Bretons, the supporters of the Bourbons from 1792 to 1800.

But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.

Dread of political and economic pollution by the survival of antagonistic classes has been for the most extreme communist leaders what fear of racial pollution was for Hitler. There, also, material explanations fail to address the extent of the killings, gruesome tortures, fantastic trails, and attempts to wipe out whole categories of people that occurred in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot's Cambodia. The revolutionary thinkers who formed and led communist regimes were not just ordinary intellectuals. They had to be fanatics in the true sense of that word. They were so certain of their ideas that no evidence to the contrary could change their minds. Those who came to doubt the rightness of their ways were eliminated, or never achieved power. The element of religious certitude found in prophetic movements was as important as their Marxist science in sustaining the notion that their vision of socialism could be made to work. This justified the ruthless dehumanization of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction. The logic of the situation in times of crisis then demanded that these 'bad elements' (as they were called in Maoist China) be killed, deported, or relegated to a permanently inferior status. That is very close to saying that the community of God, or the racially pure volksgemeinschaft could only be guaranteed if the corrupting elements within it were eliminated (Courtois et al. 1999).\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Mann motive 2005\n|{{harvnb|Mann|2005|pp=318, 321}}: \"All accounts of 20th-century mass murder include the Communist regimes.

These saw themselves as belonging to a single socialist family, and all referred to a Marxist tradition of development theory. They murderously cleansed in similar ways, though to different degrees. Later regimes consciously adapted their practices to the perceived successes and failures of earlier ones. The Khmer Rouge used China and the Soviet Union (and Vietnam and North Korea) as reference societies, while China used the Soviet Union. All addressed the same basic problem - how to apply a revolutionary vision of a future industrial society to a present agrarian one.

The ideological conviction of leaders promoting such a political scheme is thus decisive. Nevertheless, it would be far too simplistic an interpretation to assume that the sole purpose of inflicting these various forms of violence on civilians could only aim at instilling a climate of terror in this 'new society'. In fact, they are part of a broader whole, i.e. the spectrum of social engineering techniques implememted in order to transform a society completely. There can be no doubt that it is this utopia of a classless society which drives that kind of revolutionary project. The plan for political and social reshaping will thus logically claim victims in all strata of society. And through this process, communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political imaginaire.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde motive 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=xvi}}: \"The story that emerges from the exercise is edifying.

Yet her encounter with the Gulag medical-sanitary service's Moscow archive \"surprised\" Alexopoulos (1), and she now attempts to challenge the emergent scholarly consensus, with uneven success.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Governments USSR famine\n|{{harvnb|BBC|2008b}}: \"\u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0456\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 19-\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443, \u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u0491\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0439 \u0415\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0456\u044f \u0443\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0456 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0435.\" (translation: Latvia became the 19th country in the world that recognized the Holodomor as the genocide of the Ukrainian people.

Free-fire zones were established in depopulated areas, permitting Soviet troops to shoot anything that moved. In addition to killing tens of thousands in attacks on villages, this policy eventually produced one of the most massive refugee movements in modern history. Approximately 5 million people out of a total prewar population of between 15.5 and 17 million had fled the country by the early 1990s, the great majority across the border to Pakistan.

Such arguments in no way detract from the unique nature of Auschwitz - the mobilization of leading-edge technological resources and their use in an \"industrial process\" involving the construction of an \"extermination factory,\" the use of gas, and cremation. However, this argument highlights one particular feature of many Communist regimes - their systematic use of famine as a weapon. The regime aimed to control the total available food supply and, with immense ingenuity, to distribute food purely on the basis of \"merits\" and \"demerits\" earned by individuals. This policy was a recipe for creating famine on a massive scale. Remember that in the period after 1918, only Communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people. And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist-Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\"\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=The Gulag's Veiled Mortality|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/gulags-veiled-mortality-golfo-alexopoulos|date=January 7, 2013|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag|date=April 25, 2017|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-17941-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSSMDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55750-670-2}}\n* {{citation|last=Amstutz|first=Mark R.|title=International ethics: concepts, theories, and cases in global politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qTYko_PygLYC&pg=PA96&dq=mass+killing+communism#v=onepage&q=starvation%20of%205%20million%20Ukrainian%20peasants&f=false|edition=2nd|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3583-1}}\n* {{citation|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00313-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eSR1rHg5_YC&pg=PA457&dq=half+a+million+Red+Terror+of+1977+and+1978}}\n* {{citation|last=Andjelic|first=Neven|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy|publisher=Frank Cass|year=2003|page=36|isbn=0-7146-5485-X}}\n* {{citation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|title=The Worst of the Madness|publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/worst-madness/?pagination=false}}\n* {{citation|last=Aronson|first=Ronald|title=Review: Communism's Posthumous Trial.

It is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] that explains how the [[Sun]] works and how it also plays a huge part in human life. It was first broadcast on television by [[CBS]] in 1956.\n\nThe film starred [[Frank C. Baxter|Frank Baxter]] as \"Dr. Research\", and [[Eddie Albert]] as \"the fiction writer\", the other recurring character in [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series]].<ref name=\"Templeton\" /> [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] voiced the animated sun. [[Sterling Holloway]], who was uncredited, voiced an animated version of [[chlorophyll]]. The film is notable as the last project of actor [[Lionel Barrymore]], who provided the voice of [[Father Time]].<ref name=\"Gould\" /> The film was first broadcast on television two years after Barrymore's death in 1954.\n\n''Our Mr. Sun'', and a companion film ''[[Hemo the Magnificent]]'' (about [[blood]] circulation), were popular favorites for showing in primary and secondary school science classrooms from the late 1950s until the early 1980s. The film is currently available on DVD with another Frank C. Baxter film ''[[The Bell Laboratory Science Series#The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays (1957)|The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays]]'' (1957).\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film opens with Dr. Research ([[Frank C. Baxter|Dr. Frank C. Baxter]]) and the Fiction Writer ([[Eddie Albert]]) meeting Father Time ([[Lionel Barrymore]]) and Mr. Sun ([[Marvin Miller]]) who explain that time started a few billion years ago and that the Sun is a [[star]]. Mr. Sun explains that he was worshipped as various gods ([[Shamash]], [[Mithra]], [[Ra]] and [[Apollo]]) until [[Anaxagoras]] proclaimed the Sun was a very hot stone and not a god. Logic and reasoning were the beginning of the end of worshiping the Sun as [[algebra]] and the [[astrolabe]] were used to study the heavens.\n\nDr. Research explains that the [[Sun]] is 93 million miles away and its light takes 8 minutes to reach the Earth. Light from the next closest star, [[Alpha Centauri]], takes more than 4 years to get to Earth\nat a speed greater  than 186,000 miles per second. The Sun weighs the same as about 330,000 Earths and is 95% [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] gas and is not solid. The Sun is compressed by [[gravity]] so tightly that the gas at the center is more than 100 times heavier than water with a pressure of one billion tons per square inch while the surface is about one pound per square inch. The center of the Sun is 30 million degrees Fahrenheit while the surface is only 10,000 degrees, but the [[solar corona|corona]] is 1 million degrees Fahrenheit though [[Coronal heating problem|nobody knows why]], so scientists study the Sun's corona during each [[solar eclipse]].\n\n[[George Ellery Hale|Dr. George Ellery Hale]] and [[Henri-Alexandre Deslandres|Dr. Henri Deslandres]] both developed the [[spectroheliograph]]\u2014independently\u2014to study the Sun in different [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] related to specific [[atom]]s. [[Robert R. McMath|Dr. Robert R. McMath]] of the [[McMath\u2013Hulbert Observatory]] used a spectroheliograph to make [[time-lapse photography|time-lapse films]] of the [[solar prominence|prominences]] on the Sun. Using pictures from the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], and others, scientists have learned about [[sunspots]] first described by [[Galileo]]. Sunspots often appear in pairs and are about 7,000 degrees rather than the normal 10,000 degrees. The spots increase and decrease in a cycle of about 11.2 years. Studying sunspots has shown the equator rotates faster than the poles at around 25 and 1/3 days per rotation. Halfway between the equator and the poles takes about 27 and 1/2 days per rotation though nobody understands why.\n\n[[File:Zonne47kl.jpg|thumb|alt=image of a large arching solar prominence|The Great Eruptive Solar Prominence of June 4, 1946]]\n[[Bernard Lyot|Dr. Bernard Lyot]] developed the first [[coronagraph]] to study the Sun's corona. Improved coronagraphs are used at the [[High Altitude Observatory]] by [[Walter Orr Roberts|Dr. Walter Roberts]] and at the [[Evans Solar Facility]] by [[John Wainwright Evans|Dr. J. W. Evans]]. [[Donald H. Menzel|Dr. Donald H. Menzel]] was the first to use the coronagraph in America. These coronagraphs are used to film structures on the Sun called [[solar prominence|prominences]] and [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] which show matter flowing on the surface in structures many times the size of the Earth. Often matter appears from nowhere to flow down into a sunspot which is sometimes referred to as [[Coronal Rain]]. The largest recorded prominence was captured at the High Altitude Observatory in Colorado on June 4, 1946 as it left the Sun at 400,000 miles per hour.\n\nThe Sun is also studied in [[radio frequencies]] using [[radio astronomy]]. [[Edward George Bowen|Dr. E. G. Bowen]] helped pioneer radio astronomy which showed that many places in outer space emit radio waves.\n\nWhen [[solar flares]] erupt from sunspots they emit [[ultraviolet radiation]], which reach the Earth in 8 minutes, and [[Plasma (physics)|electrified fragments of atoms]] which take around 30 hours. These fragments of atoms are diverted by the [[Earth's magnetic field]], towards the North and South poles which causes the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]]. [[Carl Witz Gartlein|Dr. C. W. Gartlein]] of Cornell University took some of the first motion pictures of the ''Aurora Borealis''. These solar flares cause disruption in [[Power blackout|electricity]] and radio communications because of disturbances of the [[ionosphere]]. Because of this, the Sun is monitored from 22 stations around the world which send data to the [[Radio Storm Warning Service]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to determine when a [[solar flare|solar storm]] will reach the Earth.\n\nThe Earth receives one billion dollars of [[solar energy]] from the Sun every second when the rate is $0.02 per kilowatt-hour. The Earth receives only one two-billionth of the total energy output by the Sun, which is about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [[horsepower]]. The Sun generates this energy through [[thermonuclear reaction]]s roughly equal to 10,000 [[hydrogen bombs]] going off every second and has been doing so for the last 4 billion years. [[Hans Bethe|Dr. Hans Bethe]], in 1938, was the first to determine this fact. Every second, the Sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with the remaining 4 million tons being converted into energy in the form of [[light]], [[heat]] and [[radiation]].\n\n''Thermo the Magician'' enters to explain the [[carbon cycle]] whereby hydrogen atoms are  converted into helium atoms by fusion reactions with [[carbon]] atoms. At 30 million degrees, one hydrogen and one carbon combine into [[nitrogen]]. Adding two hydrogens to the nitrogen creates [[oxygen]]. The oxygen combines with another hydrogen to create helium and carbon, and in the process releases energy. Dr. Research then mentions combining two hydrogen atoms directly into a helium atom in the [[Proton\u2013proton chain reaction|proton-proton process]].\n\nDr. Research continues, telling how science believes the Sun started as a loose cloud of hydrogen gas compressed by gravity and this compression raised the temperature until it reached 30 million degrees and started the thermonuclear reaction. The nuclear reactions expand the Sun and gravity compresses it until the two forces reach a balance. The Sun has only used small portion of its hydrogen and has about 98% of it left which will take about 50 to 100 billion years until it is gone and the Sun dies.\n\nScience is depending on the Sun for the solution to man's two biggest problems, the first problem being food. The population of the Earth went from 500 million in 1650 to 2.5 billion in 1950. One out of every twenty human beings that ever existed, is currently alive today. Two out of every three people don't have enough to eat which is required for good health and 100 million new humans are born each year becoming a [[population explosion]].\n\nFood is grown by the Sun through [[photosynthesis]], which means ''putting together with light''. Ninety-nine percent of all food and fuel is created by the Sun through photosynthesis. [[Chlorophyll]] is the [[molecule]] responsible for photosynthesis though science isn't exactly sire how it works. They believe chlorophyll uses sunlight to combine [[carbon dioxide]] molecules with [[water]] molecules, along with salts, to create sugars and release oxygen. These sugars form the bulk of a plant including its fruit. Most of these plants are grown in the sea as [[phytoplankton]], which is the food source of [[zooplankton]], which are eaten by fish. All animals survive on food created by the Sun through photosynthesis; either directly by eating plants, or indirectly by eating animals that eat plants. The Sun provided the energy for photosynthesis through its light, which was created at the Sun's core. It takes this light 2000 years to make it from the core to the Sun's surface and another eight minutes from the Sun's surface to the Earth.\n\nThe food problem is being studied by [[Hiroshi Tamiya|Dr. Hiroshi Tamiya]] of the [[Tokugawa Biological Institute]] in his research on [[chlorella]], an algae consisting of [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s and 50% [[protein]]. Chlorella can produce about 10 times the edible material, per unit area, as a typical crop.\n\nThe second biggest problem man faces is that of [[fuel]]. In 1850, the average American used 400 horsepower-hours of fuel. By 1950, the average American used 10,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. It's estimated that by 1975 an average American will use 20,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. [[Solar energy]] will be a likely solution and research by [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Dr. Charles Greeley Abbot]] produced a [[solar powered engine]]. The French [[Mont-Louis Solar Furnace|solar furnace at Mont-Louis]] is used for high-temperature research of metals. The Indian scientist [[Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar|Dr. S. Bhatnagar]] experimented with solar ovens for cooking food and [[M\u00e1ria Telkes|Dr. M\u00e1ria Telkes]] developed a home that used [[Solar heating]] exclusively.\n\nResearch is being conducted by [[Lawrence J. Heidt|Dr. Lawrence J. Heidt]] of [[MIT]] using sunlight along with [[perchloric acid]] to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen so that it can be burned to produce energy. The waste product would be water that can be fed back into the system to create a continuous loop powered by solar energy. [[E. I. Rabinowitz|Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz]] developed a [[photogalvanic]] cell using [[thiamine]] and [[iron salts]] while working at MIT.  [[Thermocouples]] and [[phosphorescent]] wallpaper are other possible solutions to certain energy needs. [[Atomic power plant]]s and especially [[breeder reactor]]s can also provide some energy needs. In the end though, solar power will be the only solution on a long-term scale; otherwise society will have to go back to a muscle-powered existence as it was when humans and animals provided the energy to run things.\n\nIn a slightly updated version of the film, the \"solar battery\" is discussed. Based on the work of scientists Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs, this device can turn sunlight directly into electricity. A cartoon version of Dr. Research dressed as a pastry chef shows how the solar battery can be manufactured by \"cooking-up\" a wafer of silicon with a boron coating. (This became the predecessor of today's ubiquitous solar cells).\n\nThe film ends with Dr. Research and Father Time providing an overview. That human curiosity has helped drive scientific achievements and that it's important to ask questions of both science and religion.\n\n==Cast==\nIn this first film of the series, there are very few on-screen credits. Eddie Albert, Frank Baxter, Marvin Miller and Lionel Barrymore are the only actors credited on-screen.<ref name=\"Gould\" /><ref name=\"Staff\" /> and the vast majority of the film focuses on these four actors.\n\nA number of the characters are animated and thus played by voice actors. Mr. Sun and Father time are both animated. Along with these two, Chloro Phyll (voiced by [[Sterling Holloway]]) and Thermo the Magician are other roles. Dawn is the last of the animated characters and briefly appears at the beginning of the film where she introduces  Mr. Sun to tell his story.\n\nThere is one other on-screen part going to a man throwing his shoe at a radio when the broadcast is interrupted by sunspots. Three other parts in this segment are for the man's wife, radio announcer Sam Johnson and the radio host that introduces him. These last three are voice only parts and not seen on-screen.\n\n;Cast in order of appearance\n*Dr. Research, Dr. Frank C.

The Sun weighs the same as about 330,000 Earths and is 95% [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] gas and is not solid. The Sun is compressed by [[gravity]] so tightly that the gas at the center is more than 100 times heavier than water with a pressure of one billion tons per square inch while the surface is about one pound per square inch. The center of the Sun is 30 million degrees Fahrenheit while the surface is only 10,000 degrees, but the [[corona]] is 1 million degrees Fahrenheit though [[Coronal heating problem|nobody knows why]], so scientists study the Sun's corona during each [[solar eclipse]].\n\n[[George Ellery Hale|Dr. George Ellery Hale]] and [[Henri-Alexandre Deslandres|Dr. Henri Deslandres]] both developed the [[spectroheliograph]]\u2014independently\u2014to study the Sun in different [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] related to specific [[atom]]s. [[Robert R. McMath|Dr. Robert R. McMath]] of the [[McMath\u2013Hulbert Observatory]] used a spectroheliograph to make [[time-lapse photography|time-lapse films]] of the [[solar prominence|prominences]] on the Sun. Using pictures from the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], and others, scientists have learned about [[sunspots]] first described by [[Galileo]]. Sunspots often appear in pairs and are about 7,000 degrees rather than the normal 10,000 degrees. The spots increase and decrease in a cycle of about 11.2 years. Studying sunspots has shown the equator rotates faster than the poles at around 25 and 1/3 days per rotation. Halfway between the equator and the poles takes about 27 and 1/2 days per rotation though nobody understands why.\n\n[[File:Zonne47kl.jpg|thumb|alt=image of a large arching solar prominence|The Great Eruptive Solar Prominence of June 4, 1946]]\n[[Bernard Lyot|Dr. Bernard Lyot]] developed the first [[coronagraph]] to study the Sun's corona. Improved coronagraphs are used at the [[High Altitude Observatory]] by [[Walter Orr Roberts|Dr. Walter Roberts]] and at the [[Evans Solar Facility]] by [[John Wainwright Evans|Dr. J. W. Evans]]. [[Donald H. Menzel|Dr. Donald H. Menzel]] was the first to use the coronagraph in America. These coronagraphs are used to film structures on the Sun called [[solar prominence|prominences]] and [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] which show matter flowing on the surface in structures many times the size of the Earth. Often matter appears from nowhere to flow down into a sunspot which is sometimes referred to as [[Coronal Rain]]. The largest recorded prominence was captured at the High Altitude Observatory in Colorado on June 4, 1946 as it left the Sun at 400,000 miles per hour.\n\nThe Sun is also studied in [[radio frequencies]] using [[radio astronomy]]. [[Edward George Bowen|Dr. E. G. Bowen]] helped pioneer radio astronomy which showed that many places in outer space emit radio waves.\n\nWhen [[solar flares]] erupt from sunspots they emit [[ultraviolet radiation]], which reach the Earth in 8 minutes, and [[Plasma (physics)|electrified fragments of atoms]] which take around 30 hours. These fragments of atoms are diverted by the [[Earth's magnetic field]], towards the North and South poles which causes the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]]. [[Carl Witz Gartlein|Dr. C. W. Gartlein]] of Cornell University took some of the first motion pictures of the ''Aurora Borealis''. These solar flares cause disruption in [[Power blackout|electricity]] and radio communications because of disturbances of the [[ionosphere]]. Because of this, the Sun is monitored from 22 stations around the world which send data to the [[Radio Storm Warning Service]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to determine when a [[solar flare|solar storm]] will reach the Earth.\n\nThe Earth receives one billion dollars of [[solar energy]] from the Sun every second when the rate is $0.02 per kilowatt-hour. The Earth receives only one two-billionth of the total energy output by the Sun, which is about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [[horsepower]]. The Sun generates this energy through [[thermonuclear reaction]]s roughly equal to 10,000 [[hydrogen bombs]] going off every second and has been doing so for the last 4 billion years. [[Hans Bethe|Dr. Hans Bethe]], in 1938, was the first to determine this fact. Every second, the Sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with the remaining 4 million tons being converted into energy in the form of [[light]], [[heat]] and [[radiation]].\n\n''Thermo the Magician'' enters to explain the [[carbon cycle]] whereby hydrogen atoms are  converted into helium atoms by fusion reactions with [[carbon]] atoms. At 30 million degrees, one hydrogen and one carbon combine into [[nitrogen]]. Adding two hydrogens to the nitrogen creates [[oxygen]]. The oxygen combines with another hydrogen to create helium and carbon, and in the process releases energy. Dr. Research then mentions combining two hydrogen atoms directly into a helium atom in the [[Proton\u2013proton chain reaction|proton-proton process]].\n\nDr. Research continues, telling how science believes the Sun started as a loose cloud of hydrogen gas compressed by gravity and this compression raised the temperature until it reached 30 million degrees and started the thermonuclear reaction. The nuclear reactions expand the Sun and gravity compresses it until the two forces reach a balance. The Sun has only used small portion of its hydrogen and has about 98% of it left which will take about 50 to 100 billion years until it is gone and the Sun dies.\n\nScience is depending on the Sun for the solution to man's two biggest problems, the first problem being food. The population of the Earth went from 500 million in 1650 to 2.5 billion in 1950. One out of every twenty human beings that ever existed, is currently alive today. Two out of every three people don't have enough to eat which is required for good health and 100 million new humans are born each year becoming a [[population explosion]].\n\nFood is grown by the Sun through [[photosynthesis]], which means ''putting together with light''. Ninety-nine percent of all food and fuel is created by the Sun through photosynthesis. [[Chlorophyll]] is the [[molecule]] responsible for photosynthesis though science isn't exactly sire how it works. They believe chlorophyll uses sunlight to combine [[carbon dioxide]] molecules with [[water]] molecules, along with salts, to create sugars and release oxygen. These sugars form the bulk of a plant including its fruit. Most of these plants are grown in the sea as [[phytoplankton]], which is the food source of [[zooplankton]], which are eaten by fish. All animals survive on food created by the Sun through photosynthesis; either directly by eating plants, or indirectly by eating animals that eat plants. The Sun provided the energy for photosynthesis through its light, which was created at the Sun's core. It takes this light 2000 years to make it from the core to the Sun's surface and another eight minutes from the Sun's surface to the Earth.\n\nThe food problem is being studied by [[Hiroshi Tamiya|Dr. Hiroshi Tamiya]] of the [[Tokugawa Biological Institute]] in his research on [[chlorella]], an algae consisting of [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s and 50% [[protein]]. Chlorella can produce about 10 times the edible material, per unit area, as a typical crop.\n\nThe second biggest problem man faces is that of [[fuel]]. In 1850, the average American used 400 horsepower-hours of fuel. By 1950, the average American used 10,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. It's estimated that by 1975 an average American will use 20,000 horsepower-hours of fuel. [[Solar energy]] will be a likely solution and research by [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Dr. Charles Greeley Abbot]] produced a [[solar powered engine]]. The French [[Mont-Louis Solar Furnace|solar furnace at Mont-Louis]] is used for high-temperature research of metals. The Indian scientist [[Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar|Dr. S. Bhatnagar]] experimented with solar ovens for cooking food and [[M\u00e1ria Telkes|Dr. M\u00e1ria Telkes]] developed a home that used [[Solar heating]] exclusively.\n\nResearch is being conducted by [[Lawrence J. Heidt|Dr. Lawrence J. Heidt]] of [[MIT]] using sunlight along with [[perchloric acid]] to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen so that it can be burned to produce energy. The waste product would be water that can be fed back into the system to create a continuous loop powered by solar energy. [[E. I. Rabinowitz|Dr. E. I. Rabinowitz]] developed a [[photogalvanic]] cell using [[thiamine]] and [[iron salts]] while working at MIT.  [[Thermocouples]] and [[phosphorescent]] wallpaper are other possible solutions to certain energy needs. [[Atomic power plant]]s and especially [[breeder reactor]]s can also provide some energy needs. In the end though, solar power will be the only solution on a long-term scale; otherwise society will have to go back to a muscle-powered existence as it was when humans and animals provided the energy to run things.\n\nIn a slightly updated version of the film, the \"solar battery\" is discussed. Based on the work of scientists Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs, this device can turn sunlight directly into electricity. A cartoon version of Dr. Research dressed as a pastry chef shows how the solar battery can be manufactured by \"cooking-up\" a wafer of silicon with a boron coating. (This became the predecessor of today's ubiquitous solar cells).\n\nThe film ends with Dr. Research and Father Time providing an overview. That human curiosity has helped drive scientific achievements and that it's important to ask questions of both science and religion.\n\n==Cast==\nIn this first film of the series, there are very few on-screen credits. Eddie Albert, Frank Baxter, Marvin Miller and Lionel Barrymore are the only actors credited on-screen.<ref name=\"Gould\" /><ref name=\"Staff\" /> and the vast majority of the film focuses on these four actors.\n\nA number of the characters are animated and thus played by voice actors. Mr. Sun and Father time are both animated. Along with these two, Chloro Phyll (voiced by [[Sterling Holloway]]) and Thermo the Magician are other roles. Dawn is the last of the animated characters and briefly appears at the beginning of the film where she introduces  Mr. Sun to tell his story.\n\nThere is one other on-screen part going to a man throwing his shoe at a radio when the broadcast is interrupted by sunspots. Three other parts in this segment are for the man's wife, radio announcer Sam Johnson and the radio host that introduces him. These last three are voice only parts and not seen on-screen.\n\n;Cast in order of appearance\n*Dr. Research, Dr. Frank C.

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Writing==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman, [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"].

Again, even this isn\u2019t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus, and also cutting out the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Writing==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman, [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"].

Again, even this isn\u2019t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans. This track should do just the same thing.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus, and also cutting out the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

While their recording failed to crack the Hot 100, it eventually gained notoriety due to its inclusion on the 1972 compilation album ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131968]]''.\n\nIn 1969, the [[psychedelic rock]] band of [[Boston]] [[Ultimate Spinach]] released their unsuccessful cover version as a single and was included in their third and final album ''[[Ultimate Spinach III]]''.\n\n\"(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\" returned to the Hot 100 in 1975 via a remake by [[Sha Na Na]] which, despite falling short of the [[Top 40]] with a #55 peak (and #47 [[Easy Listening]]), would remain the group's most successful single. A rival remake by [[Starz (band)|Fallen Angels]] reached #106 on the bubbling under the Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe song has also been recorded by [[Little Caesar and the Consuls]] (album ''Little Caeser and the Consuls''/ 1965), [[The Outsiders (American band)|The Outsiders]] (album ''Album #2''/ 1966), [[Ultimate Spinach]] (album ''Ultimate Spinach III''/ 1969), and [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] (album ''Blue Guitars''/ 1996).\n\n== Mental's version ==\n\n(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\" was recorded by Australian band [[Mental As Anything]], released in 1980 and it reached number 27 on the [[Kent Music Report]].<ref>[http://www.australianmusicdatabase.com/recordings/just-like-romeo-and-juliet-by-mental-as-anything Australian Music Database - Mental As Anything - (Just Like) Romeo And Juliet]</ref>\n\n{{Infobox single\n| name       = (Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\n| cover      = \n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Mental As Anything]]\n| album      = \n| B-side     = Go Down\n| released   = November 1980 <ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/k8115 45cat - Mental As Anything - (Just Like) Romeo And Juliet]</ref>\n| format     = [[Gramophone record|Vinyl record]], 7\"\n| recorded   = \n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Rock (music)|Rock]]\n| length     = 2:12\n| label      = [[Regular Records]]\n| writer     = Bob Hamilton, <br> [[Freddie Gorman]]\n| producer   = Cameron Allan\n| prev_title = [[Come Around (Mental As Anything song)|Come Around]]\n| prev_year  = 1980\n| next_title = [[If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?]]\n| next_year  = 1981\n}}\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = \n\n| title1          = (Just Like) Romeo And Juliet\n| writer1         = Bob Hamilton, [[Freddie Gorman]]\n| length1         = 2:12\n\n| title2          = Go Down \n| writer2         = [[Martin Plaza]]\n| length2         = 2:44\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n* [[Martin Plaza]] &mdash; lead vocals, guitar    \n* [[Greedy Smith]] &mdash; lead vocals, keyboards, harmonica\n* [[Reg Mombassa]] &mdash; guitar, vocals  \n* [[Peter O'Doherty]] &mdash; bass, guitar, vocals \n* [[David Twohill|Wayne de Lisle]] \u2013 drums\n\n== Chart performance ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1980)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian [[Kent Music Report]]<ref name=\"Kent\">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970&ndash;1992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian) |publisher=Australian Chart Book |location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], NSW |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|-\n|}\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Mental As Anything|state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Just Like) Romeo and Juliet}}\n[[Category:1964 songs]]\n[[Category:1964 singles]]\n[[Category:1980 singles]]\n[[Category:1980 songs]]\n[[Category:Mental As Anything songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Freddie Gorman]]\n[[Category:Regular Records singles]]\n", "name_user": "The Lord of Math", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Reverted edits byJukeboxMan1990(talk) to last version by MarnetteD)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(Just_Like)_Romeo_and_Juliet"}
