{"title_page": "List of stone circles", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nA [[stone circle]] is a monument of stones arranged in a circle or ellipse. Such monuments have been constructed in many parts of the world throughout history for many different reasons. The best known tradition of stone circle construction occurred across the [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|British Isles and Brittany in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age]], with over 1000 surviving examples, including [[Avebury]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and [[Stonehenge]]. Another prehistoric tradition occurred in [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|southern Scandinavia during the Iron Age]], where stone circles were built to be mortuary monuments to the dead. Outside Europe, examples of stone circles include the 6300~6900 BCE [[Atlit Yam]] in Israel and 3000~4000 BCE [[Gilgal Refaim]] nearby, and the [[Stone Circles (Hong Kong)|Bronze Age monuments in Hong Kong]]. Stone circles also exist in a megalithic tradition located in Senegal and the Gambia.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF01118143 | volume=11-11 | title=Field survey in the tumulus zone of Senegal | journal=The African Archaeological Review | pages=73\u2013107|year = 1993|last1 = McIntosh|first1 = Susan Keech| last2=McIntosh | first2=Roderick J. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | jstor = 2843758 | pages=173\u2013228| title=Stone Circles in Gambia| journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| volume=53| last1=Parker| first1=Henry| year=1923}}</ref>\n\nThis is an incomplete photographic list of these [[stone circle]]s.\n\n==Australia==\nSee also [[Aboriginal stone arrangement]]\nStone circles in Australia are sometimes revered as sacred sites by the Australian Aboriginal people. While often small, there are some large stones comparable to their European counterparts, particularly in Victoria.

The site was discovered in 1931, with detailed archaeological excavations taking place in 1946, and in 1951-1952.\n\nThe larger circle, named the \u201cManza\u201d circle has a diameter of 46 meters, and is the largest stone circle found in Japan. A number of reconstructions of Jomon period dwellings have been built around the site. The slightly smaller circle, named the \u201cNonakado\u201d circle, is 42 meters in diameter and is located around 90 meters away, separated from the \u201cManza\u201d circle by Akita Prefectural Route 66. Each circle is made from rounded river stones brought from another river approximately 7 kilometers away. Each circle in concentric, with and inner and an outer ring separated by an open strip approximately 8 meters wide.[2]Each circle contains smaller clusters of stone, including\u00a0standing stones\u00a0surrounded by elongated stones in a radiating orientation, forming a\u00a0sundial\u00a0which points toward the sunset on the\u00a0summer solstice\u00a0and allows for calculation of the\u00a0winter solstice, the\u00a0vernal equinox\u00a0and the sun's movements.[3]\n\nEach circle is surrounded by the remains of buildings, storage pits and garbage dumps, and clay figurines, clayware and stoneware (including everyday pottery), stone swords and objects have been discovered. Although the form of the stone circles made have been based on the shape of circular settlements, there is no indication of permanent settlement on the site.\n\nThe site has been submitted for inscription on the\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage List\u00a0as one of the\u00a0J\u014dmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid\u014d, Northern T\u014dhoku, and other regions\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u014cyu_Stone_Circles\n\n==Poland==\n{| border=\"0\"\n|[[Image:Poland Odry - stone ring.jpg|thumb]]\n|'''Odry''' &ndash; Odry in Poland.\n|}\n\n==Syria==\n{| border=\"0\"\n|[[Image:Gilgal Refa'im - Rujm el-Hiri.JPG|thumb]]\n|'''[[Rujm el-Hiri]] (4~3000 BCE)''' &ndash; Located northeast of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. \n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany]]\n*[[List of Stone Age art]]\n*[[Gobekli Tepe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Stone circles}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiRAdYOjh58 Video and commentary on the Twelve Apostles, Dumfries, Scotland.]\n\n{{Prehistoric technology}}\n{{European Standing Stones}}\n{{Stone Circles of Ireland, Britain, and Brittany}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stone circles}}\n[[Category:Stone circles|*]]\n[[Category:Neolithic]]\n[[Category:Megalithic monuments]]\n[[Category:Rock art]]\n[[Category:Archaeology-related lists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nA [[stone circle]] is a monument of stones arranged in a circle or ellipse. Such monuments have been constructed in many parts of the world throughout history for many different reasons. The best known tradition of stone circle construction occurred across the [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|British Isles and Brittany in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age]], with over 1000 surviving examples, including [[Avebury]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and [[Stonehenge]]. Another prehistoric tradition occurred in [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|southern Scandinavia during the Iron Age]], where stone circles were built to be mortuary monuments to the dead. Outside Europe, examples of stone circles include the 6300~6900 BCE [[Atlit Yam]] in Israel and 3000~4000 BCE [[Gilgal Refaim]] nearby, and the [[Stone Circles (Hong Kong)|Bronze Age monuments in Hong Kong]].

{"title_page": "Braess's paradox", "text_new": "{{short description|paradox related to increasing roadway capacity}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}\n'''Braess' paradox''' is the observation that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall [[road traffic|traffic]] flow through it. The paradox was postulated in 1968 by German mathematician [[Dietrich Braess]], who noticed that adding a road to a particular [[traffic congestion|congested]] road traffic network would increase overall journey time.\n\nThe paradox may have analogies in [[electrical power grid]]s and biological systems. It has been suggested that in theory, the improvement of a malfunctioning network could be accomplished by removing certain parts of it. The paradox has been used to explain instances of improved [[traffic flow]] when existing major roads are closed.\n\n== Discovery and definition ==\nDietrich Braess, a mathematician at [[Ruhr University]], [[Germany]], noticed the flow in a road network could be impeded by adding a new road, when he was working on [[traffic modelling]]. His idea was that if each driver is making the [[optimization|optimal]] self-interested decision as to which route is quickest, a shortcut could be chosen too often for drivers to have the shortest travel times possible. More formally, the idea behind Braess's discovery is that the [[Nash equilibrium]] may not equate with the best overall flow through a network.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129520-600-42nd-st-paradox-cull-the-best-to-make-things-better/  42nd St Paradox: Cull the best to make things better], 16 January 2014 by Justin Mullins</ref>\n\nThe paradox is stated as follows:<blockquote>\"For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions, one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the [[flow density|density of the flow]]. If every driver takes the path that looks most favourable to them, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.\"</blockquote>\n\nAdding extra capacity to a [[network (mathematics)|network]] when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. That is because the [[Nash equilibrium]] of such a system is not necessarily optimal. The network change induces a new game structure which leads to a (multiplayer) [[prisoner's dilemma]]. In a Nash equilibrium, drivers have no incentive to change their routes. While the system is not in a Nash equilibrium, individual drivers are able to improve their respective travel times by changing the routes they take. In the case of Braess' paradox, drivers will continue to switch until they reach Nash equilibrium despite the reduction in overall performance.\n\nIf the latency functions are linear, adding an edge can never make total travel time at equilibrium worse by a factor of more than 4/3.<ref name=\"RoughgardenTardos\">\n{{cite web|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/routing.pdf|title=How Bad is Selfish Routing?|last2=Tardos|first2=\u00c9va|publisher=Journal of the ACM|last1=Roughgarden|first1=Tim|accessdate=2016-07-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409061229/http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/routing.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Possible instances of the paradox in action ==\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nIn 1983, Steinberg and Zangwill provided, under reasonable assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Braess' paradox to occur in a general transportation network when a new route is added.

The travel time in minutes on the Start-A road is the number of travelers (T) divided by 100, and on Start-B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start-A-End route with <math>a</math> drivers would be <math>\\tfrac{a}{100} + 45</math>. The time needed to drive the Start-B-End route with <math>b</math> drivers would be <math>\\tfrac{b}{100} + 45</math>. As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that <math>a + b = 4000</math> can be used to derive the fact that <math>a = b = 2000</math> when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes <math>\\tfrac{2000}{100} + 45 = 65</math> minutes. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route.\n\nNow suppose the dashed line A-B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start-A-B-End. To his surprise he finds that his time is <math>\\tfrac{2000}{100} + \\tfrac{2001}{100} = 40.01</math> minutes, a saving of almost 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start-B-End route, their time will be <math>\\tfrac{2500}{100} + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 65</math> minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to <math> 45 + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 85</math> minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes <math>\\tfrac{4000}{100} + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 80</math> minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A-B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.\n\n=== Existence of an equilibrium ===\nIf one assumes the travel time for each person driving on an edge to be equal, an equilibrium will always exist.\n\nLet <math>L_e(x)</math> be the formula for the travel time of each person traveling along edge <math>e</math> when <math>x</math> people take that edge. Suppose there is a traffic graph with <math>x_e</math> people driving along edge <math>e</math>. Let the energy of e, <math>E(e)</math>, be\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{x_e} L_e(i) = L_e(1) + L_e(2) + \\cdots + L_e(x_e)</math>\n\n(If <math>x_e = 0</math> let <math>E(e) = 0</math>). Let the total energy of the traffic graph be the sum of the energies of every edge in the graph.\n\nTake a choice of routes that minimizes the total energy. Such a choice must exist because there are finitely many choices of routes. That will be an equilibrium.\n\nAssume, for contradiction, this is not the case. Then, there is at least one driver who can switch the route and improve the travel time. Suppose the original route is <math>e_0, e_1, \\ldots, e_n</math> while the new route is <math>e'_0, e'_1, \\ldots, e'_m</math>. Let <math>E</math> be total energy of the traffic graph, and consider what happens when the route <math>e_0, e_1, ... e_n</math> is removed. The energy of each edge <math>e_i</math> will be reduced by <math>L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})</math> and so the <math>E</math> will be reduced by <math>\\sum_{i=0}^n L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})</math>. That is simply the total travel time needed to take the original route. If the new route is then added, <math>e'_0, e'_1, \\ldots, e'_m</math>, the total energy <math>E</math> will be increased by the total travel time needed to take the new route. Because the new route is shorter than the original route, <math>E</math> must decrease relative to the original configuration, contradicting the assumption that the original set of routes minimized the total energy.\n\nTherefore, the choice of routes minimizing total energy is an equilibrium.\n\n=== Finding an equilibrium ===\nThe above proof outlines a procedure known as [[best response]] dynamics, which finds an equilibrium for a linear traffic graph and terminates in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is termed \"best response\" because at each step of the algorithm, if the graph is not at equilibrium then some driver has a best response to the strategies of all other drivers and switches to that response.\n\nPseudocode for Best Response Dynamics:\n  Let ''P'' be some traffic pattern.\n  '''while''' ''P'' is not at equilibrium:\n    compute the potential energy ''e'' of ''P''\n    '''for each''' driver ''d'' in ''P'':\n      '''for each''' alternate path ''p'' available to ''d'':\n         compute the potential energy ''n'' of the pattern when ''d'' takes path ''p''\n         '''if''' ''n'' < ''e'':\n           modify ''P'' so that ''d'' takes path ''p''\n  '''continue''' the topmost '''while'''\n\nAt each step, if some particular driver could do better by taking an alternate path (a \"best response\"), doing so strictly decreases the energy of the graph. If no driver has a best response, the graph is at equilibrium. Since the energy of the graph strictly decreases with each step, the best response dynamics algorithm must eventually halt.\n\n=== How far from optimal is traffic at equilibrium? ===\nIf the travel time functions are linear, that is <math>L_e(x) = a_e x + b_e</math> for some <math>a_e, b_e \\geq 0</math>, then at worst, traffic in the energy-minimizing equilibrium is twice as bad as socially optimal.<ref name=\"EasleyKleinberg\"><!-- please do not point the URL to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch08.pdf, as it does not contain the reference cited by Easley and Kleinberg -->\n{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (8.3 Advanced Material: The Social Cost of Traffic at Equilibrium)|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Jon|publisher=Jon Kleinberg|last1=Easley|first1=David|website=Jon Kleinberg's Homepage|accessdate=2015-05-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316015111/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-16|url-status=live}} \u2013 This is the preprint of {{ISBN|9780521195331}}</ref>\n\nProof:\nLet ''Z'' be some traffic configuration, with associated energy ''E''(''Z'') and total travel time ''T''(''Z'').

The paradox was postulated in 1968 by German mathematician [[Dietrich Braess]], who noticed that adding a road to a particular [[traffic congestion|congested]] road traffic network would increase overall journey time.\n\nThe paradox may have analogies in [[electrical power grid]]s and biological systems. It has been suggested that in theory, the improvement of a malfunctioning network could be accomplished by removing certain parts of it. The paradox has been used to explain instances of improved [[traffic flow]] when existing major roads are closed.\n\n== Discovery and definition ==\nDietrich Braess, a mathematician at [[Ruhr University]], [[Germany]], noticed the flow in a road network could be impeded by adding a new road, when he was working on [[traffic modelling]]. His idea was that if each driver is making the [[optimization|optimal]] self-interested decision as to which route is quickest, a shortcut could be chosen too often for drivers to have the shortest travel times possible. More formally, the idea behind Braess's discovery is that the [[Nash equilibrium]] may not equate with the best overall flow through a network.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129520-600-42nd-st-paradox-cull-the-best-to-make-things-better/  42nd St Paradox: Cull the best to make things better], 16 January 2014 by Justin Mullins</ref>\n\nThe paradox is stated as follows:<blockquote>\"For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions, one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the [[flow density|density of the flow]]. If every driver takes the path that looks most favourable to them, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.\"</blockquote>\n\nAdding extra capacity to a [[network (mathematics)|network]] when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. That is because the [[Nash equilibrium]] of such a system is not necessarily optimal. The network change induces a new game structure which leads to a (multiplayer) [[prisoner's dilemma]]. In a Nash equilibrium, drivers have no incentive to change their routes. While the system is not in a Nash equilibrium, individual drivers are able to improve their respective travel times by changing the routes they take. In the case of Braess' paradox, drivers will continue to switch until they reach Nash equilibrium despite the reduction in overall performance.\n\nIf the latency functions are linear, adding an edge can never make total travel time at equilibrium worse by a factor of more than 4/3.<ref name=\"RoughgardenTardos\">\n{{cite web|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/routing.pdf|title=How Bad is Selfish Routing?|last2=Tardos|first2=\u00c9va|publisher=Journal of the ACM|last1=Roughgarden|first1=Tim|accessdate=2016-07-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409061229/http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/routing.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Possible instances of the paradox in action ==\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nIn 1983, Steinberg and Zangwill provided, under reasonable assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Braess' paradox to occur in a general transportation network when a new route is added. (Note that their result applies to the addition of ''any'' new route, not just to the case of adding a single link.) As a corollary, they obtain that Braess' paradox is about as likely to occur as not occur; their result applies to random rather than planned networks and additions.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1287/trsc.17.3.301| title = The Prevalence of Braess' Paradox| journal = Transportation Science| volume = 17| issue = 3| pages = 301| year = 1983| last1 = Steinberg | first1 = R. | last2 = Zangwill | first2 = W.

The travel time in minutes on the Start-A road is the number of travelers (T) divided by 100, and on Start-B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start-A-End route with <math>a</math> drivers would be <math>\\tfrac{a}{100} + 45</math>. The time needed to drive the Start-B-End route with <math>b</math> drivers would be <math>\\tfrac{b}{100} + 45</math>. As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that <math>a + b = 4000</math> can be used to derive the fact that <math>a = b = 2000</math> when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes <math>\\tfrac{2000}{100} + 45 = 65</math> minutes. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route.\n\nNow suppose the dashed line A-B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start-A-B-End. To his surprise he finds that his time is <math>\\tfrac{2000}{100} + \\tfrac{2001}{100} = 40.01</math> minutes, a saving of 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start-B-End route, their time will be <math>\\tfrac{2500}{100} + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 65</math> minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to <math> 45 + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 85</math> minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes <math>\\tfrac{4000}{100} + \\tfrac{4000}{100} = 80</math> minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A-B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.\n\n=== Existence of an equilibrium ===\nIf one assumes the travel time for each person driving on an edge to be equal, an equilibrium will always exist.\n\nLet <math>L_e(x)</math> be the formula for the travel time of each person traveling along edge <math>e</math> when <math>x</math> people take that edge. Suppose there is a traffic graph with <math>x_e</math> people driving along edge <math>e</math>. Let the energy of e, <math>E(e)</math>, be\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{x_e} L_e(i) = L_e(1) + L_e(2) + \\cdots + L_e(x_e)</math>\n\n(If <math>x_e = 0</math> let <math>E(e) = 0</math>). Let the total energy of the traffic graph be the sum of the energies of every edge in the graph.\n\nTake a choice of routes that minimizes the total energy. Such a choice must exist because there are finitely many choices of routes. That will be an equilibrium.\n\nAssume, for contradiction, this is not the case. Then, there is at least one driver who can switch the route and improve the travel time. Suppose the original route is <math>e_0, e_1, \\ldots, e_n</math> while the new route is <math>e'_0, e'_1, \\ldots, e'_m</math>. Let <math>E</math> be total energy of the traffic graph, and consider what happens when the route <math>e_0, e_1, ... e_n</math> is removed. The energy of each edge <math>e_i</math> will be reduced by <math>L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})</math> and so the <math>E</math> will be reduced by <math>\\sum_{i=0}^n L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})</math>. That is simply the total travel time needed to take the original route. If the new route is then added, <math>e'_0, e'_1, \\ldots, e'_m</math>, the total energy <math>E</math> will be increased by the total travel time needed to take the new route. Because the new route is shorter than the original route, <math>E</math> must decrease relative to the original configuration, contradicting the assumption that the original set of routes minimized the total energy.\n\nTherefore, the choice of routes minimizing total energy is an equilibrium.\n\n=== Finding an equilibrium ===\nThe above proof outlines a procedure known as [[best response]] dynamics, which finds an equilibrium for a linear traffic graph and terminates in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is termed \"best response\" because at each step of the algorithm, if the graph is not at equilibrium then some driver has a best response to the strategies of all other drivers and switches to that response.\n\nPseudocode for Best Response Dynamics:\n  Let ''P'' be some traffic pattern.\n  '''while''' ''P'' is not at equilibrium:\n    compute the potential energy ''e'' of ''P''\n    '''for each''' driver ''d'' in ''P'':\n      '''for each''' alternate path ''p'' available to ''d'':\n         compute the potential energy ''n'' of the pattern when ''d'' takes path ''p''\n         '''if''' ''n'' < ''e'':\n           modify ''P'' so that ''d'' takes path ''p''\n  '''continue''' the topmost '''while'''\n\nAt each step, if some particular driver could do better by taking an alternate path (a \"best response\"), doing so strictly decreases the energy of the graph. If no driver has a best response, the graph is at equilibrium. Since the energy of the graph strictly decreases with each step, the best response dynamics algorithm must eventually halt.\n\n=== How far from optimal is traffic at equilibrium? ===\nIf the travel time functions are linear, that is <math>L_e(x) = a_e x + b_e</math> for some <math>a_e, b_e \\geq 0</math>, then at worst, traffic in the energy-minimizing equilibrium is twice as bad as socially optimal.<ref name=\"EasleyKleinberg\"><!-- please do not point the URL to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch08.pdf, as it does not contain the reference cited by Easley and Kleinberg -->\n{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (8.3 Advanced Material: The Social Cost of Traffic at Equilibrium)|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Jon|publisher=Jon Kleinberg|last1=Easley|first1=David|website=Jon Kleinberg's Homepage|accessdate=2015-05-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316015111/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-16|url-status=live}} \u2013 This is the preprint of {{ISBN|9780521195331}}</ref>\n\nProof:\nLet ''Z'' be some traffic configuration, with associated energy ''E''(''Z'') and total travel time ''T''(''Z''). For each edge, the energy is the sum of an [[arithmetic progression]], and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, one can show that ''E''(''Z'') \u2264 ''T''(''Z'') \u2264 2''E''(''Z''). If <math>Z_o</math> is the socially-optimal traffic flow and <math>Z_e</math> is the energy-minimizing traffic flow, the inequality implies that <math>T(Z_e) \\leq 2E(Z_e) \\leq 2E(Z_o) \\leq 2T(Z_o)</math>.\n\nThus, the total travel time for the energy-minimizing equilibrium is at most twice as bad as for the optimal flow.\n\n=== Dynamics analysis of Braess' paradox ===\nIn 2013, Dal Forno and Merlone<ref name=\"Dal FornoMerlone2013\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Border-collision bifurcations in a model of Braess paradox | journal = [[Mathematics and Computers in Simulation]] | volume = 87 | year = 2013 | pages = 1\u201318 | issn = 0378-4754 | doi = 10.1016/j.matcom.2012.12.001 }}</ref> interpret Braess' paradox as a dynamical ternary choice problem. The analysis shows how the new path changes the problem. Before the new path is available, the dynamics is the same as in binary choices with externalities, but the new path transforms it into a ternary choice problem. The addition of an extra resource enriches the complexity of the dynamics. In fact, there can even be coexistence of cycles, and the implication of the paradox on the dynamics can be seen from both a geometrical and an analytical perspective.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's anomaly]]\n* [[Routing#Path selection|Route choice]]\n* [[Downs\u2013Thomson paradox]]\n* [[Jevons paradox]]\n* [[Marchetti's constant]]\n* [[Induced demand]]\n* [[Lewis\u2013Mogridge position]]\n* [[Hotelling's law]]\n* [[Paradox of enrichment]]: Increasing the food available to an ecosystem may introduce dynamic instability, and even lead to extinction.\n* [[Traffic wave]]\n* [[Apportionment paradox]]\n* [[John Glen Wardrop]]\n* [[Hydra effect]]\n* [[Rat running]]\n* [[Road diet]]\n* [[Bufferbloat]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* D.
