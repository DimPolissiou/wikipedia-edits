{"title_page": "Cuba under Fidel Castro", "text_new": "(follow my tik tok @queenavonni thx continue) Under the rule of [[Fidel Castro]], the nation of [[Cuba]] underwent significant economic, political, and social changes. In the [[Cuban Revolution]], Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of [[Fulgencio Batista]], forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] from 1959 to 1976. He was also the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], the most senior position in the [[Communist state]] from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became [[President of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of State (Cuba)|Council of State]] and [[Prime Minister of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Council of Ministers]]. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, [[Ra\u00fal Castro]], but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011.\n\nFidel Castro's staunch belief in a [[Communism|communist ideology]] and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the [[Cold War]] struggle between the [[United States]] and its allies versus the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Events such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, in which American-connected forces failed to topple Castro's administration, continue to attract attention from historians as well as laypeople worldwide.\n\nCastro died of natural causes in late 2016 in [[Havana]]. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.\n\n=={{vanchor|Premiership}} 1959\u20131976==\n===Consolidating leadership: 1959===\n[[Image:Fidel Castro - MATS Terminal Washington 1959.jpg|thumb|Castro is seen in [[Washington, D.C.]], arriving at the MATS Terminal, in April 1959.]]\n\nOn February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]], and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=173}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=228}}.</ref> Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a [[public relations]] firm for a [[charm offensive]], and presented himself as a \"man of the people\".

He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture.

Angolan President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 276&ndash;281, 284, 287.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 291&ndash;294.</ref>\n\nCastro's government decided to diversify its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 288.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 290, 322.</ref> The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 294.</ref> Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of [[Roman Catholicism]] and the syncretic faith of [[Santeria]].

In the [[Cuban Revolution]], Castro and an associated group of revolutionaries toppled the ruling government of [[Fulgencio Batista]], forcing Batista out of power on 1 January 1959. Castro, who had already been an important figure in Cuban society, went on to serve as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] from 1959 to 1976. He was also the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], the most senior position in the [[Communist state]] from 1961 to 2011. In 1976, Castro officially became [[President of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of State (Cuba)|Council of State]] and [[Prime Minister of Cuba|President]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Council of Ministers]]. He retained the title until 2008, when the presidency was transferred to his brother, [[Ra\u00fal Castro]], but retained his position of Party First Secretary until 2011.\n\nFidel Castro's staunch belief in a [[Communism|communist ideology]] and his criticisms of other international figures elevated the prominence of his rule. He launched a wide range of economic and social changes. Castro's Cuba became a key element within the [[Cold War]] struggle between the [[United States]] and its allies versus the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. Events such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, in which American-connected forces failed to topple Castro's administration, continue to attract attention from historians as well as laypeople worldwide.\n\nCastro died of natural causes in late 2016 in [[Havana]]. He had dealt with severe health problems for the past decade, remarking publicly about struggles with mobility and other issues. Even after his death, Castro's ideas continue to be the foundation of Cuban government.\n\n=={{vanchor|Premiership}} 1959\u20131976==\n===Consolidating leadership: 1959===\n[[Image:Fidel Castro - MATS Terminal Washington 1959.jpg|thumb|Castro is seen in [[Washington, D.C.]], arriving at the MATS Terminal, in April 1959.]]\n\nOn February 16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]], and accepted the position on the condition that the Prime Minister's powers be increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=173}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=228}}.</ref> Between 15 and 26 April Castro visited the U.S. with a delegation of representatives, hired a [[public relations]] firm for a [[charm offensive]], and presented himself as a \"man of the people\".

He additionally forbade further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture.

Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalised in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratisation was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 276&ndash;281, 284, 287.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 291&ndash;294.</ref>\n\nCastro's government decided to diversify its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 288.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 290, 322.</ref> The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.<ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 294.</ref> Economic hardship led many Cubans to turn towards religion, both in the forms of [[Roman Catholicism]] and the syncretic faith of [[Santeria]].

{"title_page": "Baire function", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], '''Baire functions''' are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s obtained from [[continuous functions]] by transfinite iteration of the operation of forming pointwise limits of sequences of functions. They were introduced by [[Ren\u00e9-Louis Baire]] in 1899. A [[Baire set]] is a set whose [[indicator function|characteristic function]] is a Baire function. (There are other, almost equivalent, but inequivalent definitions of Baire sets.)\n\n==Classification of Baire functions==\nBaire functions of class \u03b1, for any countable [[ordinal number]] \u03b1, form a [[vector space]] of [[Real number|real]]-valued functions defined on a [[topological space]], as follows.\n\n*The Baire class 0 functions are the [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s.\n*The Baire class 1 functions are those functions which are the [[Pointwise convergence|pointwise limit]] of a [[sequence]] of Baire class 0 functions.\n*In general, the Baire class \u03b1 functions are all functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions of Baire class less than \u03b1.\n\nSome authors define the classes slightly differently, by removing all functions of class less than \u03b1 from the functions of class \u03b1. This means that each Baire function has a well defined class, but the functions of given class no longer form a vector space.\n\n[[Henri Lebesgue]] proved that (for functions on the [[unit interval]]) each Baire class of a countable ordinal number contains functions not in any smaller class, and that there exist functions which are not in any Baire class.\n\n==Baire class 1==\nExamples:\n*The [[derivative]] of any [[differentiable function]] is of class 1. An example of a differentiable function whose derivative is not continuous (at ''x''&thinsp;=&thinsp;0) is the function equal to <math>x^2 \\sin(1/x)</math> when ''x''&thinsp;\u2260&thinsp;0, and 0 when ''x''&thinsp;=&thinsp;0. An infinite sum of similar functions (scaled and displaced by [[rational number]]s) can even give a differentiable function whose derivative is discontinuous on a dense set. However, it necessarily has points of continuity, which follows easily from The Baire Characterisation Theorem (below; take ''K''&thinsp;=&thinsp;''X''&thinsp;=&thinsp;'''R''').\n*The characteristic function of the set of [[integer]]s, which equals 1 if ''x'' is an integer and 0 otherwise. (An infinite number of large discontinuities.)\n*[[Thomae's function]], which is 0 for [[Irrational number|irrational]] ''x'' and 1/''q'' for a rational number ''p''/''q'' (in reduced form). (A dense set of discontinuities, namely the set of rational numbers.)\n*The characteristic function of the [[Cantor set]], which equals 1 if ''x'' is in the Cantor set and 0 otherwise. This function is 0 for an uncountable set of ''x'' values, and 1 for an uncountable set. It is discontinuous wherever it equals 1 and continuous wherever it equals 0. It is approximated by the continuous functions <math>g_n(x) = \\max(0,{1-nd(x,C)})</math>, where <math>d(x,C)</math> is the distance of x from the nearest point in the Cantor set.\n\nThe Baire Characterisation Theorem states that a real valued function ''f'' defined on a [[Banach space]] ''X'' is a Baire-1 function if and only if for every [[Empty set|non-empty]] [[Metric_space#Open_and_closed_sets,_topology_and_convergence|closed]] subset ''K'' of ''X'', the [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of ''f'' to ''K'' has a point of continuity relative to the [[Topological space|topology]] of ''K''.\n\nBy another theorem of Baire, for every Baire-1 function the points of continuity are a [[comeager]] [[G\u03b4 set|''G''<sub>\u03b4</sub> set]] {{harv|Kechris|1995|loc=Theorem (24.14)}}.\n\n==Baire class 2==\nExamples:\n*An example of a Baire class 2 function on the interval [0,1] that is not of class 1 is the characteristic function of the rational numbers, <math>\\chi_\\mathbb{Q}</math>, also known as the [[Dirichlet function]]. It is discontinuous everywhere. This can be seen by noting that for any finite collection of rationals, the characteristic function for this set is Baire 1: namely the function <math>g_n(x) = \\max(0,{1-nd(x,K)})</math> converges identically to the characteristic function of <math>K</math>, where <math>K</math> is the finite collection of rationals. Since the rationals are countable, we can look at the pointwise limit of these things over <math>K_n = \\{r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n\\}</math>, where <math>r_n</math> is an enumeration of the rationals.

An [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] co-production, it is based on the [[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|2013 video game of the same name]], with some elements of [[Rise of the Tomb Raider|its sequel]] by [[Crystal Dynamics]], and is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' film series. The film stars [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Lara Croft]], who embarks on a perilous journey to her father's last-known destination, hoping to solve the mystery of his disappearance. [[Dominic West]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Daniel Wu]], and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n[[Principal photography]] lasted from January to June 2017, and took place at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, and in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The first ''Tomb Raider'' film not to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], it was released in the United Kingdom on March 14, 2018, and in the United States on March 16, 2018, by [[Warner Bros.

Vikander's performance and the characterization of Croft drew a polarized response; some described her as a \"capable, powerful, and unobjectified heroine\", while others called her bland, and a \"punching bag and onlooker.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=March 14, 2018 |title= 'Tomb Raider': What the Critics Are Saying |first= Katie |last= Kilkenny |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher= [[Prometheus Global Media]] |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tomb-raider-review-roundup-1094464 |accessdate= October 24, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180314224426/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tomb-raider-review-roundup-1094464 |archive-date= March 14, 2018 }}</ref> A sequel is scheduled to be released in March 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- As per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nFollowing the disappearance of her father, Lord Richard Croft, [[Lara Croft]] makes a living as a [[bike courier]]. When she is arrested after a bike accident involving a police car, Richard's business partner Ana Miller posts her bail. Lara has never claimed her inheritance for many years as she believes her father to still be alive, but Miller warns Lara that if she does not claim it, her father's country estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb. There she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into [[Himiko]], the mythical Queen of [[Yamatai]] who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy all of his research, but she ignores his warnings so that she can investigate further.\n\nLara travels to [[Hong Kong]] where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship ''Endurance'', to sail into the [[Devil's Sea]] and the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She awakens only to encounter Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity, which seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Vogel takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and revealing that he intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu Ren to his slave force; eventually, the two of them try to escape, and Lara is the only one successful.\n\nAfter surviving rapids and narrowly avoiding going over a waterfall with the wreck of a wartime airplane, Lara is forced to kill a Trinity guard after nightfall. She follows a mysterious figure through the jungle, and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off the next morning to steal Vogel's satellite phone. Lara makes contact with Lu Ren, and he, along with the other slaves, stage a distraction that allows Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and take the phone. In the ensuing chaos, Lu Ren commandeers an assault rifle, provides cover for the escapees and guns down several Trinity soldiers, while Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb and is captured by Vogel, who persuades Lara to open the tomb, something she has prepared for since she was a child. At that point, the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away, thus enabling the party to enter that which has not been seen for at least two thousand years.\n\nThe party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's [[sarcophagus]]. When a Trinity soldier attempts to remove her corpse, he is infected by a highly infectious pathogen that reduces those infected to an aggressive zombie-like state. Lara realizes that Himiko was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, who chose to entomb herself so that she could not infect others. Vogel concludes that he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for detaching a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, although Vogel escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Vogel as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts and kills Vogel by infecting him with the finger. She escapes the tomb as it collapses, regrouping with Lu Ren and the slaves; they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.\n\nLara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's [[front company]], Patna, is actually a [[subsidiary]] of Croft Holdings. She proceeds to investigate Trinity further and begins to suspect that Ana is one of their agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance; this was to have Lara sign over control of Croft Holdings' business operations to her when Richard stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity's ruthlessness firsthand, she prepares for her next adventure.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Lara returns to Alan's pawn shop to buy weapons and decides to take two identical pistols.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Lara Croft]]\n** Maisy De Freitas as 7-year-old Lara\n** [[Emily Carey]] as 14-year-old Lara\n* [[Dominic West]] as Lord Richard Croft, Lara's archaeologist father.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Mathias Vogel, a rival archaeologist of Richard Croft, and a member of Trinity, a shadowy organization.\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Lu Ren, the ship captain who helps Lara to search for her father.\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Ana Miller, an associate at Richard Croft's company, Croft Holdings.\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Mr. Yaffe, an associate at Croft Holdings.\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Alan, a pawn shop owner.\n* [[Jaime Winstone]] as Pamela, Alan's wife\n* [[Hannah John-Kamen]] as Sophie, Lara's friend\n\nAdditionally, [[Antonio Aakeel]] play Lara's friend Nitin.

When she is arrested after a bike accident involving a police car, Richard's business partner Ana Miller posts her bail. Lara has never claimed her inheritance for many years as she believes her father to still be alive, but Miller warns Lara that if she does not claim it, her father's country estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb. There she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into [[Himiko]], the mythical Queen of [[Yamatai]] who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy all of his research, but she ignores his warnings so that she can investigate further.\n\nLara travels to [[Hong Kong]] where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship ''Endurance'', to sail into the [[Devil's Sea]] and the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She awakens only to encounter Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity, which seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Vogel takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and revealing that he intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu Ren to his slave force; eventually, the two of them try to escape, and Lara is the only one successful.\n\nAfter surviving rapids and narrowly avoiding going over a waterfall with the wreck of a wartime airplane, Lara is forced to kill a Trinity guard after nightfall. She follows a mysterious figure through the jungle, and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off the next morning to steal Vogel's satellite phone. Lara makes contact with Lu Ren, and he, along with the other slaves, stage a distraction that allows Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and take the phone. In the ensuing chaos, Lu Ren commandeers an assault rifle, provides cover for the escapees and guns down several Trinity soldiers, while Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb and is captured by Vogel, who persuades Lara to open the tomb, something she has prepared for since she was a child. At that point, the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away, thus enabling the party to enter that which has not been seen for at least two thousand years.\n\nThe party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's [[sarcophagus]]. When a Trinity soldier attempts to remove her corpse, he is infected by a highly infectious pathogen that reduces those infected to an aggressive zombie-like state. Lara realizes that Himiko was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, who chose to entomb herself so that she could not infect others. Vogel concludes that he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for detaching a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, although Vogel escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Vogel as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts and kills Vogel by infecting him with the finger. She escapes the tomb as it collapses, regrouping with Lu Ren and the slaves; they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.\n\nLara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's [[front company]], Patna, is actually a [[subsidiary]] of Croft Holdings. She proceeds to investigate Trinity further and begins to suspect that Ana is one of their agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance; this was to have Lara sign over control of Croft Holdings' business operations to her when Richard stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity's ruthlessness firsthand, she prepares for her next adventure.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Lara returns to Alan's pawn shop to buy weapons and decides to take two identical pistols.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Lara Croft]]\n** Maisy De Freitas as 7-year-old Lara\n** [[Emily Carey]] as 14-year-old Lara\n* [[Dominic West]] as Lord Richard Croft, Lara's archaeologist father.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Mathias Vogel, a rival archaeologist of Richard Croft, and a member of Trinity, a shadowy organization.\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Lu Ren, the ship captain who helps Lara to search for her father.\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Ana Miller, an associate at Richard Croft's company, Croft Holdings.\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Mr. Yaffe, an associate at Croft Holdings.\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Alan, a pawn shop owner.\n* [[Jaime Winstone]] as Pamela, Alan's wife\n* [[Hannah John-Kamen]] as Sophie, Lara's friend\n\nAdditionally, [[Antonio Aakeel]] play Lara's friend Nitin.

In the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from [[McMurdo Station]] in the Antarctic. It was carried by the [[Polar vortex]] winds in a circle around the [[South Pole]], returning after two weeks. From this phenomenon the telescope took its name.\n\nThe BOOMERanG team was led by [[Andrew E.
