At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km|order=flip}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}|order=flip} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

[[Thai Airways International]] cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's [[fuel fraction]] just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, [[Air France-KLM]] SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\".<ref>Michaels, Daniel.

The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. [[Lufthansa]], which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340 more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue.<ref name=\"reedbusinessinformationlimited\"/><ref>Haria, Rupa. \"Weight in Waiting.\" ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 14 April 2014. pp. 54-55.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Snecma]] announced that they planned to use the A340 as a flying testbed for the development of a new [[Propfan|open rotor engine]]. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered a replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=17 October 1981|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%203243.html|accessdate=23 January 2011|title=Commercial Aircraft of the World part 2|journal=Flight International}}</ref>\n\nTo differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same [[wing]] and [[airframe]]; the projected savings were estimated at US$500&nbsp;million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million).<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=22}}</ref> The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

[[Thai Airways International]] cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's [[fuel fraction]] just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, [[Air France-KLM]] SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\".<ref>Michaels, Daniel.

The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. [[Lufthansa]], which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340 more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue.<ref name=\"reedbusinessinformationlimited\"/><ref>Haria, Rupa. \"Weight in Waiting.\" ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 14 April 2014. pp. 54-55.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Snecma]] announced that they planned to use the A340 as a flying testbed for the development of a new [[Propfan|open rotor engine]]. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines.

Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n, also known as [[Guatemala City]].\n\nThe territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]]. Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.\n\nFrom the mid- to late-19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. In 1944, the authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}\n\nFrom 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3\u201315}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGuatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes many endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guatemala\" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n'' [[:nah:Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n|(nahwiki)]], or \"place of many trees\", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for \"many trees\"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or perhaps more specifically for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]].

The project applied Lidar technology on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is overwhelming finding in over 150 years of Maya archaeology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/archaeologists-find-ancient-lost-cities-using-lasers/ar-BBNIdqB|title=Archaeologists Find Ancient Lost Cities Using Lasers|website=msn.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=1 February 2018|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/archaeologists-find-ancient-cities-using-lasers-1145042|title=ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ANCIENT MAYAN LOST CITIES IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|website=BBC News|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/ancient-maya-structures-guatemala-lasers|title=Lasers Reveal 60,000 Ancient Maya Structures in Guatemala|last=Little|first=Becky|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hidden-ancient-mayan-apos-megalopolis-110002872.html|title=Hidden Ancient Mayan 'Megalopolis' With 60,000 Structures Discovered in Guatemala Using Lasers|website=yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/60000-lost-mayan-structures-found-beneath-guatemalan-jungle-2018-2|title=Archaeologists found thousands of hidden structures in the Guatemalan jungle \u2013 and it could re-write human history|last=Berke|first=Jeremy|website=Business Insider|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hidden-ancient-mayan-megalopolis-60000-structures-discovered-guatemala-using-797865|title=HIDDEN ANCIENT MAYAN 'MEGALOPOLIS' WITH 60,000 STRUCTURES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olodonation.com/2018/09/30/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mayan-lost-city-in-northern-guatemala-using-lasers/|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Mayan Lost City in Northern Guatemala Using Lasers|last=Chukwurah|first=Precious|date=30 September 2018|website=Nigeria's Entertainment News, Music, Video, Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/09/27/this-major-discovery-upends-long-held-theories-about-maya-civilization/?_ga=2.164638527.1462411402.1566373807-1089594517.1566373807&noredirect=on|title=This major discovery upends long-held theories about the Maya civilization|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2018/02/02/mayan-megacity-discovered-guatemala-jungle/|title=Archaeologists discovered an ancient Mayan megacity hidden in a Guatemalan jungle|last=Wehner|first=Mike|date=2 February 2018|website=BGR|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Colonial era (1519\u20131821) ===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|upright|The ''Conquistador'' [[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial Spanish efforts to conquer Guatemala.<ref name=\"Lovell05p58\">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>|alt=Painting of a bearded man in early 16th-century attire including prominent ruff collar, wearing a decorative breastplate, with his right hand resting on his hip and his left hand grasping a cane, or riding crop.]]\n\nAfter they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519.

Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].\n\nIn 1854 Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.\n\nHis rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.\n\n=== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865\u20131871) ===\n[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of Guatemala from 1865 to 1871.]]\n{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of Guatemala]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |title       = Vicente Cerna\n |author      = prensalibre.com\n |accessdate  = 5 September 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175325/http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |archivedate = 6 January 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Liberal author {{ILL|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} {{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|s.f.|p=106}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n{{quote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military.

During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p = 82}}\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first \"[[Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana]]\" (\"Central American Fair\") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.\n\nHis administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920) ===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\n[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\n=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931\u20131944) ===\n{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}\nThe [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for \"efficiency and cruelty\" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12\u201315}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10\u201311}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29\u201332}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}\n\nUbico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67\u201371}}\n\nUbico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US declared war against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be \"another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]\".{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38\u201339}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances.

Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains.\n\nAll major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Pet\u00e9n is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.\n\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Sarstoon River|Sarst\u00fan,]] which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Pet\u00e9n and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\n[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]\nGuatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.\n\nGuatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1]].\n\nNatural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world.

As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html As Biofuel Demands Grows, So Do Guatemala's Hunger Pangs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108075322/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html |date=8 January 2013 }}.

Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.\n\nIn 1945, in order to overcome \"the Indian problem\", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201386, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanizaci\u00f3n|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Guatemala}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in Guatemala}}\n[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]\n\n[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.\n\nSince the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity.

Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}\nSince the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Reflecting Guatemala's colonial and post-colonial history, encounters with multiple global art movements also have produced a wealth of artists who have combined the traditional [[Primitivism|primitivist]] or [[Na\u00efve art|naive aesthetic]] with European, North American, and other traditions.\n\nThe [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas \"Rafael Rodr\u00edguez Padilla\"]] is Guatemala's leading art school, and several leading indigenous artists, also graduates of that school, have work in the permanent collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno \"Carlos M\u00e9rida\"|Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno]] in the capital city.

Many contemporary music groups in Guatemala play [[Caribbean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]]-influenced [[punta]], [[Latin pop]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican regional]], and [[mariachi]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Guatemalan cuisine}}\n[[File:091225 tamales.JPG|thumb|Black and red [[tamale]]s in Guatemala]]\nMany traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Football ====\n{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]].

Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.\n\n==== Futsal ====\n\n[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].\n\nGuatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round. It has also participated in every [[Grand Prix de Futsal]] since [[2009 Grand Prix de Futsal|2009]], reaching the semifinals in [[2014 Grand Prix de Futsal|2014]].\n\n==== Olympics ====\n{{Further|Guatemala at the Olympics}}\nThe [[Guatemalan Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1947 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year. Guatemala participated in the [[Guatemala at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]], and in every edition since the [[Guatemala at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]]. It has also appeared in a single [[Winter Olympics]] edition, in [[Guatemala at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].\n\n[[Erick Barrondo]] won the only Olympic medal for Guatemala so far, silver in [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 20 kilometres walk|race walking]] at the [[Guatemala at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==== Other sports ====\nGuatemala also keeps [[National sports teams of Guatemala|national sports teams]] in several disciplines.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Guatemala|Latin America}}\n* [[Index of Guatemala-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Guatemala]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aguirre |first=Lily |title=The land of eternal spring: Guatemala, my beautiful country |year=1949 |publisher=Patio Press |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LodnAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|title=\u00a1Ecce Pericles!|publisher= Tipograf\u00eda Nacional|location=Guatemala|year= 1945|ref=harv|language=Spanish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190285559/Arevalo-Martinez-Ecce-Pericles#scribd}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concordatoen00unseguat|last=Aycinena|first=Pedro de|author-link=Pedro de Aycinena|title=Concordato entre la Santa Sede y el presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Guatemala|publisher=Imprenta La Paz|year=1854|location=Guatemala|language=Latin, Spanish|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Banco de Guatemala |url=http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/en/currency%20and%20bills/Monedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&e=18108 |title=Ilustraciones de Cada una de las 11 Denominaciones.

Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n, also known as [[Guatemala City]].\n\nThe territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]]. Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.\n\nFrom the mid- to late-19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. In 1944, the authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms.

The project applied Lidar technology on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is overwhelming finding in over 150 years of Maya archaeology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/archaeologists-find-ancient-lost-cities-using-lasers/ar-BBNIdqB|title=Archaeologists Find Ancient Lost Cities Using Lasers|website=msn.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=1 February 2018|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/archaeologists-find-ancient-cities-using-lasers-1145042|title=ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ANCIENT MAYAN LOST CITIES IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|website=BBC News|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/ancient-maya-structures-guatemala-lasers|title=Lasers Reveal 60,000 Ancient Maya Structures in Guatemala|last=Little|first=Becky|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hidden-ancient-mayan-apos-megalopolis-110002872.html|title=Hidden Ancient Mayan 'Megalopolis' With 60,000 Structures Discovered in Guatemala Using Lasers|website=yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/60000-lost-mayan-structures-found-beneath-guatemalan-jungle-2018-2|title=Archaeologists found thousands of hidden structures in the Guatemalan jungle \u2013 and it could re-write human history|last=Berke|first=Jeremy|website=Business Insider|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hidden-ancient-mayan-megalopolis-60000-structures-discovered-guatemala-using-797865|title=HIDDEN ANCIENT MAYAN 'MEGALOPOLIS' WITH 60,000 STRUCTURES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olodonation.com/2018/09/30/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mayan-lost-city-in-northern-guatemala-using-lasers/|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Mayan Lost City in Northern Guatemala Using Lasers|last=Chukwurah|first=Precious|date=30 September 2018|website=Nigeria's Entertainment News, Music, Video, Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/09/27/this-major-discovery-upends-long-held-theories-about-maya-civilization/?_ga=2.164638527.1462411402.1566373807-1089594517.1566373807&noredirect=on|title=This major discovery upends long-held theories about the Maya civilization|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2018/02/02/mayan-megacity-discovered-guatemala-jungle/|title=Archaeologists discovered an ancient Mayan megacity hidden in a Guatemalan jungle|last=Wehner|first=Mike|date=2 February 2018|website=BGR|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Colonial era (1519\u20131821) ===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n}}\n[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|upright|The ''Conquistador'' [[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial Spanish efforts to conquer Guatemala.<ref name=\"Lovell05p58\">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>|alt=Painting of a bearded man in early 16th-century attire including prominent ruff collar, wearing a decorative breastplate, with his right hand resting on his hip and his left hand grasping a cane, or riding crop.]]\n\nAfter they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519.

Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts \u2013 Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitep\u00e9quez as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n went to [[Antigua, Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm\u00e1n defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzm\u00e1n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: \"Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!\"{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera.

Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named \"La Monta\u00f1a\" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].\n\nIn 1854 Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.\n\nHis rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.\n\n=== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865\u20131871) ===\n[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of Guatemala from 1865 to 1871.]]\n{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of Guatemala]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |title       = Vicente Cerna\n |author      = prensalibre.com\n |accessdate  = 5 September 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175325/http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |archivedate = 6 January 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Liberal author {{ILL|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} {{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|s.f.|p=106}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n{{quote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military.

During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p = 82}}\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first \"[[Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana]]\" (\"Central American Fair\") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.\n\nHis administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920) ===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\n[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\n=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931\u20131944) ===\n{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}\nThe [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for \"efficiency and cruelty\" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12\u201315}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10\u201311}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29\u201332}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}\n\nUbico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67\u201371}}\n\nUbico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US declared war against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be \"another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]\".{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38\u201339}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances.

He is celebrated for challenging the Mexican president to a gentleman's [[duel]] on the bridge on the south border to end a feud on the subject of illegal fishing by Mexican boats on Guatemala's Pacific coast, two of which were sunk by the Guatemalan Air Force. Ydigoras authorized the training of 5,000 anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cubans]] in Guatemala.

However a coup from within the military, backed by the [[Kennedy Administration]], prevented the election from taking place, and forestalled a likely victory for Arevalo.

The government's failure to respond rapidly to the aftermath of the earthquake and to relieve homelessness gave rise to widespread discontent, which contributed to growing popular unrest. General [[Romeo Lucas Garc\u00eda]] assumed power in 1978 in a fraudulent election.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of two new guerrilla organizations, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and the Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). They began guerrilla attacks that included urban and rural warfare, mainly against the military and some civilian supporters of the army.

The Guatemalan government arraigned her, since it had enough evidence to suspect her involvement in the \"La Linea\" scandal. The prominence of US Ambassador Todd Robinson in the Guatemalan political scene once the scandal broke led to the suspicion that the US government was behind the investigation, perhaps because it needed an honest government in Guatemala to counter the presence of China and Russia in the region.<ref name=porras2015>\n{{cite news\n|last=Porras Castej\u00f3n\n|first=Gustavo\n|title=Los Estados Unidos y su nueva forma de colonialismo en la que no hay necesidad de tropas\n|url=http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/eeuu-y-su-nueva-forma-de-colonialismo-en-la-que-no-hay-necesidad-de-tropas\n|newspaper=Plaza P\u00fablica\n|location=Guatemala\n|date=19 June 2015\n|accessdate=19 June 2015\n|language=es\n|ref=harv\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924074450/http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/eeuu-y-su-nueva-forma-de-colonialismo-en-la-que-no-hay-necesidad-de-tropas\n|archive-date=24 September 2015\n|url-status=live\n\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe UN anti-corruption committee has reported on other cases since then, and more than 20 government officials have stepped down.

Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains.\n\nAll major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Pet\u00e9n is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.\n\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Sarstoon River|Sarst\u00fan,]] which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Pet\u00e9n and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\n[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]\nGuatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.\n\nGuatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1]].\n\nNatural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world.

Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.\n\nIn 1945, in order to overcome \"the Indian problem\", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201386, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanizaci\u00f3n|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Guatemala}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in Guatemala}}\n[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]\n\n[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.\n\nSince the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries.

To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle.

Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It also boasts private museums such as the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]] and the [[Museo Popol Vuh]], which focuses on Maya archaeology.

Many contemporary music groups in Guatemala play [[Caribbean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]]-influenced [[punta]], [[Latin pop]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican regional]], and [[mariachi]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Guatemalan cuisine}}\n[[File:091225 tamales.JPG|thumb|Black and red [[tamale]]s in Guatemala]]\nMany traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Football ====\n{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]]. However, the team has failed to qualify to a [[FIFA World Cup]] so far. Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.\n\n==== Futsal ====\n\n[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].\n\nGuatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round.

It is regarded as one of the seven great cemeteries of the time (now known as the [[Magnificent Seven, London|\"Magnificent Seven\"]]). It is open 24 hours a day.<ref>https://www.fothcp.org/find-us</ref>\n\nIt was originally named '''The City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery''' but was called '''Bow Cemetery''' by locals. The cemetery pre-dates the creation of the modern Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965, and instead takes its name from the original, older and somewhat larger, [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets (or Tower division)]] \u2013 from which the modern borough also takes its name. The historic parish boundary which defines the [[Mile End]] and [[Bromley-by-Bow]] areas runs north to south through the park, with Mile End to the west and Bromley-by-Bow to the east.\n\n==Location==\nThe Main Gate is on Southern Grove (on the crossing with Hamlets Way). There are also small gates on Hamlet Way and Cantrell Road. The nearest tube stations are [[Mile End tube station|Mile End]] and [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[Victorian Era]], all of London's dead were buried in small urban churchyards, which were so overcrowded and so close to where people lived, worked, and worshipped that they were causing disease and ground water contamination.\n\nAn [[Act of Parliament]] was passed which allowed joint-stock companies to purchase land and set up large cemeteries outside the boundaries of the City of London. There were seven great cemeteries (the [[Magnificent Seven, London|\"Magnificent Seven\"]]) laid out about the same time (1832&ndash;41). [[Highgate Cemetery]] is the most well known; the others are [[Nunhead Cemetery|Nunhead]], [[West Norwood Cemetery|West Norwood]], [[Kensal Green Cemetery|Kensal Green]], [[Brompton Cemetery|Brompton]], [[Abney Park Cemetery|Abney Park]].\n\nThe City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company was made up of eleven wealthy directors whose occupations reflected the industries of the day: corn merchant, merchant ship broker and ship owner, timber merchant, and [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]]. The company bought {{convert|27|acre|m2|0}} of land and the cemetery was divided into a consecrated part for [[Anglican]] burials and an unconsecrated part for all other denominations.\n\nTower Hamlets Cemetery was formally consecrated by the [[Bishop of London]] on Saturday 4 September 1841 prior to being opened for burials. The cemetery was consecrated in the morning; the first burial took place in the afternoon.<ref>[http://www.fothcp.org/PDFs/THCP_LEAFLET_02.pdf According to the leaflet produced by the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park]</ref>\n[[File:Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park.jpg|right|thumb|Walking in the Park]]\n\nTower Hamlets Cemetery was very popular with people from the East End and by 1889 247,000 bodies had been interred; the cemetery remained open for another 77 years. In the first two years 60% of the burials were in public graves and by 1851 this had increased to 80%. Public graves were the property of the company and were used to bury those whose families could not afford to buy a plot.  Several persons, entirely unrelated to each other, could be buried in the same grave within the space of a few weeks. Allegedly some graves were dug 40 feet deep and contained up to 30 bodies.\n\nThe cemetery itself did not remain in a tidy and elegant state for long. Only 55 years after it was opened it was reported to be in a neglected state. During the [[Second World War]] the cemetery was bombed five times during raids on the City of London; both cemetery chapels were damaged<ref name=cwgc>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/41902/CITY%20OF%20LONDON%20AND%20TOWER%20HAMLETS%20CEMETERY] CWGC Cemetery Report.</ref> and [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] damage can be seen on the graves by the 1994 Soanes Centre in the north-west corner of the park.  Burials continued taking place until 1966, when the [[Greater London Council]] (G.L.C.) bought the company for \u00a3100,000 under the G.L.C.(General Powers) Act and the ground was closed for burials.  The intention was to create an open space for the public and relevant parts of the cemetery were freed from the effects of [[consecration]]. In October 1967 a further \u00a3125,000 was spent clearing the chapels and {{convert|0.68|acre|m2|0}} of graves. Strong local opposition and problems of funding stopped the clearance.\n\n==Today==\n[[Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]] took over the ownership of the park in 1986.  It was declared a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in May 2000 along with adjacent open land on Cantrell Road and Ackroyd Drive.
