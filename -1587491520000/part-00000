school. The school was established in 1963 by Mr. Murari Mohan Laha and others. The school is sometimes called '''Boys' School. ' Chayan Adhikary vs Kalyan'''.\n\n==History==\nNabapally Boys' High School is a higher secondary school in [[Barasat]], [[India]]. The first headmaster of the school was Mr. Murari Mohan Laha. On the outermost fringe of the area known as Old Nabapally, in the mauza of West Ichhapur, stands Nabapally Boys' High School. The school was established in 1963; temporarily run on the premises of the nearby Jogendranath Girls' School, to be shifted later to the school's present arena. In 1966 the school was upgraded to the status of a junior high school and some years later in 1970 and 1999, the school was accorded the statuses of a 'Madhyamik School' and a 'Higher Secondary School'.\n\nThe school is a three-storey construction with two two-storey sides housing the primary and the secondary/higher-secondary sections. At the higher secondary level the school teaches the three streams of Commerce, Science and Arts, the latter being the newest addition to the curriculum after being introduced from the 2010-11 session.\n\n==Faculty==\n*Sujit kumar Roy  - Headmaster\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe school is a higher secondary school, from class 1 to 12. The curriculum is as per \"[[West Bengal Board of Secondary Education]]\"(till class 10) and \"[[West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education]]\" (Class 11 and 12). The common curriculum is followed till class 10. In class 11 and 12, there are 3 streams: Science, Commerce and Arts.\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-style: solid; border-color: #aaccee; border-width: 1px; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 1.5em;\">\n\n'''Subjects offered: Grade I to V'''\n\n{|\n|-----\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\" |\n*[[Bengali language|Bengali]]\n* English\n* History\n* Geography\n* Mathematics\n* Sciences\n* Art\n* Physical Education\n|}\n'''Subjects offered: Grade VI to X'''\n\n<td valign=top width=30%>\n<td valign=top width=30%>\n* English\n* Bengal\n* Mathematics\n* History\n* Geography\n* Physical Sciences\n* Life Sciences\n* Computer science\n* Physical Education\n* Work Education including arts\n</td>\n<td valign=top width=30%>\nAdditional subjects:\n* Additional Mathematics\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* [[Mechanics]]\n* Computer science\n* Book kepping and accounts\n* Additional Biology\n* Pisciculture\n* [[Sanskrit]]\n* [[Arabic]]\n* Work Education & Physical Education\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n'''Subjects offered:Grades XI \u2013 XII '''\n\n{|\n|-----\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\" |\n* English\n* Bengali\n* Sanskrit\n* Geography\n* History\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\" |\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Physics\n* Mathematics\n* Statistics\n* Computer Science\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\" |\n* Accounting\n* Business mathematics\n* Economic Geography\n|}\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Category:Schools in Colonial India]]\n[[Category:Boys' schools in India]]\n[[Category:Primary schools in West Bengal]]\n[[Category:High schools and secondary schools in West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Schools in North 24 Parganas district]]\n[[Category:Barasat]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1846]]\n[[Category:1846 establishments in British India]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors.

For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur.\n\nA population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low [[fertility rate]]. The broad base of the pyramid means a relative majority of the population lies between ages 0\u201314, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population [[sub-replacement fertility]] level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter [[life expectancy]] of sixty years.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/population-pyramids.aspx|title=From Population Pyramids to Pillars|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'' women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The [[dependency ratio]] refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15\u201364). According to Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. [[Population momentum]], when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term [[doubling time]], which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the [[age stratification]]  since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population.\n\nIn the [[demographic transition]] model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone.  In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.\n\n==Types==\nEach country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.<ref name=osu>[http://www.fsl.orst.edu/pnwerc/wrb/Atlas_web_compressed/5.Human_Populations/5h.pyramids_web.pdf Population Pyramids] - Oregon State University</ref>\n\n;\"Stationary\" pyramid\n:A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remains constant over time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Population An Introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|isbn=978-1305094505|location=|pages=309}}</ref> Stationary population is when a population contains equal birth rates and death rates.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;\"Expansive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with high birth rate and low life expectancy.<ref name=osu/> The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort gets larger than the size of the previous year.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Korenjak-C\u02c7 erne, Kej\u017ear, Batagelj|year=2008|title=Clustering of Population Pyramids|url=|journal=Informatica|volume=32|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n;\"Constrictive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom.

For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur.\n\nA population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low [[fertility rate]]. The broad base of the pyramid means a relative majority of the population lies between ages 0\u201314, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population [[sub-replacement fertility]] level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter [[life expectancy]] of sixty years.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/population-pyramids.aspx|title=From Population Pyramids to Pillars|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'' women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The [[dependency ratio]] refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15\u201364). According to Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. [[Population momentum]], when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term [[doubling time]], which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the [[age stratification]]  since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population.\n\nIn the [[demographic transition]] model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone.  In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.\n\n==Types==\nEach country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.<ref name=osu>[http://www.fsl.orst.edu/pnwerc/wrb/Atlas_web_compressed/5.Human_Populations/5h.pyramids_web.pdf Population Pyramids] - Oregon State University</ref>\n\n;\"Stationary\" pyramid\n:A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remains constant over time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Population An Introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|isbn=978-1305094505|location=|pages=309}}</ref> Stationary population is when a population contains equal birth rates and death rates.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;\"Expansive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with high birth rate and low life expectancy.<ref name=osu/> The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort gets larger than the size of the previous year.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Korenjak-C\u02c7 erne, Kej\u017ear, Batagelj|year=2008|title=Clustering of Population Pyramids|url=|journal=Informatica|volume=32|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n;\"Constrictive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom.

The Republican alliance took 45 of Spain's 52 provincial capitals.<ref>Mary Vincent, p.117</ref> The Republican alliance perceived the religious question at this time as a matter of trying to define a new, subordinate place of the Catholic Church. Many of the constitutional articles were modeled on the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese Constitution of 1911]] \u2013 separation of church and state; freedom of worship became a fundamental civic right; civil marriage and divorce were introduced; schools and cemeteries were secularized. Catholic schools continued, but outside the state system, and in 1933 further legislation banned all [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] and male congregations from teaching. ''State education would be secular, obligatory, free of charge, and available to all.''<ref>Mary Vincent, Spain 1833\u20132002, p.122</ref> Also, the [[Jesuit]]s were expelled from Spain. \n\nReligion was to be placed in the private sphere, religious worship confined to religious buildings \u2013 the public world of the Republic was to be determinedly secular. Establishing a secular state was a fundamental tenet of Republicanism, but the alliance was 'a hybrid of traditions', encompassing liberals, radicals, federalists, anarchists \u2013 and there was less unanimity as to other anti-religious policies. The Socialist minister of justice [[w:es:Fernando de los Rios|Fernando de los Rios]], argued that the deputies should not deprive communities of their traditional festivities and that processions like [[Holy Week in Seville]] or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] transcended a purely religious significance \u2013 but was ignored.<ref>Vincent, p.122</ref> At [[Pentecost]] in 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded [[restitution]]. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the perceived injustices.\n\n==Nationalization of Church properties==\nOn 3 June 1933, Pius issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis|''Dilectissima Nobis'']], in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes in order to continuously use these properties. \"Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her.\"<ref>Dilectissima Nobis,  9\u201310</ref> Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 12</ref>\n\n==Expropriation of private Catholic schools==\nThe churches were not spared in the expropriation. Numerous churches and temples were destroyed by burning, after they were nationalized. Jesuits were prohibited from teaching. Private Catholic schools of Religious Orders and Congregations were expropriated, without regard to the free will of founders and benefactors. The purpose was to create solely secular schools.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 21</ref>\n\n==Beginning of the Civil War==\nThe Civil War in Spain started in 1936, during which thousands of churches were destroyed and thirteen bishops and some 7000 clergy and religious Spaniards were assassinated.<ref>Franzen  397</ref> Another estimate is that in the course of the Red Terror, 6,832&nbsp;members of the Catholic clergy were killed.<ref name=\"Cueva 355\">{{Harvnb|de la Cueva|1998|p=355}}</ref> Though many right-wing Catholics, including the majority of bishops, had always been opposed to the Republic and \" bore a considerable responsibility for the growing friction that culminated in open warfare\", the wave of persecution of religion that swept across the Republican zone, where the rebellion had failed, during the first months of the war, helped to assure \"Franco of the highly useful support of the ecclesiastical establishment throughout the whole of the Civil War.\"<ref>Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense, p.51</ref> ([[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] for example, handed money, collected from Ireland for the reconstruction of churches and replacement of liturgical articles, to Franco's rebel army.)<ref>Raguer, p.74</ref>\n\n==The speech at Castelgandolfo, 14 September 1936==\nIn the first bloody months of the Civil War some ecclesiastics managed to escape to [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], or Rome and these brought news reports with them, with which they sought to apply pressure to the organs of the Vatican Curia with whom they maintained regular relations. (Hilari Raguer, a [[Benedictines]] writer on religious history, points out that they necessarily delivered a biased report \u2013 bishops and aristocrats carry more weight than peasants and workers \u2013 and poor workers had no means of escape to take them from the Francoist zone to Rome). [[Wlodimir Ledochowski|Father Ledochowski]], the superior general of the Jesuits, ordered the Jesuit press all over the world to support the rebels. It became known that Pius XI would grant an audience, at his summer residence at [[Castelgandolfo]], to a large group of Spanish refugees and deliver an address to them. Expectation rose amongst the Spanish clergy in Rome. Though it should have fallen to Cardinal [[Francisco Vidal y Barraquer]] to lead the group of Spanish clergy, there was great animosity to him from the majority of Spanish ecclesiastics and the Pope instructed him to say he judged it wiser not to attend. Some 500 Spaniards, mostly priests and religious, as well as some secular supporters of the Uprising, did attend. The content of the speech disappointed the more fanatical among the supporters of the military rising. He read it in Italian and a Spanish translation was distributed as a leaflet. Entitled ''La vostra presenza'' (Your Presence Here), it began with lamentation for the fate of the victims and condemned communism. This part of the speech was used from this point on in Francoist propaganda. He quoted from the [[Book of Revelation]], telling the refugees they ''came out of great tribulation'' (Rev. 7, 14). Yet whilst some hoped and expected that the Insurgent cause would be declared a Holy War or Crusade \u2013 it had already been so designated by various bishops and generals \u2013 Pius XI expressed horror at fratricidal war and exhorted the insurgents to love their enemies. He thanked those who had tried to alleviate the miseries of war, though their effect had been minimal. This too may have displeased the fervent supporters of Franco who were present, for the insurgents had always obstructed intervention of this kind by governments or neutral organisations such as the [[International Red Cross]]<ref>Raguer, p.83</ref>\n\n==Reactions to Pius XI's Castelgandolfo speech==\nFour days after the speech [[Eugenio Pacelli]] wrote to Vidal y Barraquer to say the Pope had wanted to comfort the refugees but not to identify himself with the warlike attitude of the side that called itself Catholic. In the so-called 'National' zone however, the Francoists widely publicized the speech \u2013 but only those paragraphs which seemed to endorse the idea of a Crusade, the second part being suppressed. The Spanish bishops acted upon the impulse suggested by the propagandist version of the speech and \"let loose a cascade of Pastoral Letters in favour of Franco.\"<ref>Raguer, p.85</ref> So, for example, [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the [[Bishop of Salamanca]], on receiving a version of Pius XI's speech from the military, published his Pastoral Letter, ''Las Dos ciudades'',(''The Two cities''), dated 30 September, an attempt at a theological justification for Franco's cause. The moral weight of the Vatican was considered of great significance to the generals of the Uprising \u2013 for one thing it was wanted at this time to aid the suppression of the separatist nationalisms in Spain. In 1936 it was [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalism which particularly troubled the Francoists as it presented to the world the sight of Catholics who were loyal to the Republic and resisting with arms the invasion of the ''Crusaders''.<ref>Raguer, p.86</ref>\n\n==Magaz, Goma, and Pius XI==\nThe [[Holy See]] maintained relations with the Republic in 1936 \u2013 thereafter they grew weaker. Relations began with [[Burgos]], the base of Franco's Nationalists, with the appointment of an unofficial Charg\u00e9. The Junta de Defensa at Burgos appointed a monarchist, Antonio de Magaz y Pers, the [[w:es:Marquesado de Magaz|Marqu\u00e9s de Magaz]] to establish contact with the Vatican. Magaz had been ambassador to the Holy See in the late 1920s and had sought to enroll the assistance of Pius XI in the suppression of ''catalanismo'' and ''bizcaitarrismo'' (Catalan and Basque nationalism) \u2013 and the removal of Cardinal Vidal y Barraquer from the Primatial Archiepiscopal seat of [[Tarragona]]. Magaz did not succeed in removing the Catalan cardinal but did get decrees prohibiting the use of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in pastoral matters and ordering the expulsion from the seminaries of all teachers and pupils suspected of separatism.<ref>Raguer, p.88</ref>\n\nMagaz's second mission to the Vatican in 1936 lasted barely a year. He endlessly demanded the canonical condemnation of the Basque nationalists, who refused to surrender to the rebels. He made complaints and threats against what he called the ''neutralism'' of the Vatican in the face of a war of religion. Pius XI met Magaz in a papal audience on 23 November 1936. Pius had just received a report from the Bishop of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[w:es:Mateo Mugica|Mateo Mugica Urresterazu]], telling him how the Franco insurgents had expelled him from his seat and telling him that 14 priests of his diocese had been shot, and many more jailed or banished from their parishes. According to a report of J.A. Gimenez Arnau, who asked Magaz about the audience, Magaz told him Pius XI replied to his complaints about the Vatican's attitude to the Nationalist authorities by declaring, \"In the National Spain, priests are shot just as they are in the Spain of the other side.\" In another account, when Magaz said that the slight sympathy for the National government of the Pope's words caused him great distress, Pius XI was thrown into a fury and declared; ''\"''How can anyone dare to speak of our slight sympathy when on many different and public occasions we have condemned Communism and conferred our benevolence on those who fight it?\" From that moment Magaz had condemned himself in the eyes of both the Vatican and Franco.<ref>Raguer, p.95</ref> Pius XI appointed [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] as his unofficial and confidential representative at Franco's headquarters, a role he performed from 19 December 1936 to 18 September 1937, while Monsignore [[Ildebrando Antoniutti|Antoniutti]], who had arrived in Spain in October 1936 on another mission, was named as the Papal Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Goma's influence on the attitude of Pius XI was powerful. Having met with [[Eugenio Pacelli]] and Pius XI on December 19, 1936, Goma wrote in his diary; \" the unfriendly attitude towards Spain was abandoned after my report to Pacelli had been read and a formula was found to create close ties with the government of Franco.\"\n\nGoma was a man of the Church, unlike Magaz, and suspicious of some of those surrounding Franco \u2013 an anti-clerical sector which could stain the perceived Christian spirit of the Franco movement. This anti-clerical sector he confronted in his Pastoral Letter of 28 January 1938, to mark the fourteenth anniversary of the coronation of Pius XI. In the third part, entitled 'Pius XI and Spain' he spoke of the Pope's love for Spain and in the fourth part, ''Prevengamonos'' ('Let us prevent'), he challenged those who attacked Pius XI for not intervening more determinedly in favour of the Francoist Uprising. In the fifth he confronted anti-Vatican sentiment in the Movement; \"We have heard and read, 'Catholics, yes; Vaticanists, no'; and it is with pain that we have seen it expressed in more sophisticated terms by a section of the press.\" Franco, since 1 October 1936, had taken over all the powers of the junta and sought to gain the full support of Pius XI. The policy of Pius XI, which Goma first and afterwards Antoniutti and [[Gaetano Cicognani|Cicognani]] maintained, towards Franco's government, was characterised by a strong anticommunism on the one hand, and on the other a suspicion of [[falangism]] and of the influence of Franco's German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies; the Vatican policy sought to guide the regime into the repeal of the anti-clerical laws of the Republic and away from 'pagan' and imported totalitarian temptations. Goma was received by Franco on 29 December 1936 and six basic points were established at the meeting \u2013 points that were the seeds of the Concordat of 1953.\n\n==''The Divini Redemptoris'' encyclical, March 1937==\nPius XI's 'third way' policy of neither communism nor fascism was illustrated by the publication in early 1937 of one encyclical against Communism and another against Nazism. The ''Divini Redemptoris'' devoted a paragraph to ''the horrors of communism in Spain'', and dwelt on the assassination of priests and religious. In Franco's Spain this encyclical against Communism received wide circulation, but the publication of ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' was prohibited. Franco told von Faupel, German Ambassador, that while Pius XI was recognised as the highest religious authority in Spain, any interference in internal Spanish affairs had to be rejected. He told the German ambassador that he too, Franco, had to fight against the Vatican. He had instructed the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], Goma, that no mention should be made in Spain of the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' and that in this way any criticism of Germany would be cut off.<ref>Raguer, p.103</ref>\n\nIn 1937 there was dual representation with the Salamanca government, raised to the level of Charg\u00e9s d'Affaires, with Antoniutti at Salamanca and Churruca at Rome, and mention of the Valencia (Republican) government reduced to a line of dots in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. By 1938 relations with Franco reached the level of full Ambassador and [[Nuncio]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope Pius Xi And Spain}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past.

The key differences are in the pricing plans, storage space and number of features.\n\nAs noted by ''[[TechRepublic]]'' in 2013, pricing plans differ in that \"Google Apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard Google Apps for Business package: $5 per user per month or $50 per user per year ... In contrast, Office 365 has a multitude of plans (six as of September, 2013) which can be both good and bad since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice\". Storage space varies because \"Office 365 gives users 50&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of space in [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] and 1&nbsp;TB in [[OneDrive]]. Google Apps provides 30&nbsp;GB of space which is spread among [[Gmail]], [[Google Drive|Drive]] and [[Picasa]]\". And regarding features, it states that \"Office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with Word, Excel and the rest of the gang for years; there is less of a learning curve than with Google Apps if the latter represents a brand new experience ... However, it's also true that Office is notorious for being loaded with complex, unused features which can cause confusion, so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price, especially if companies are paying for advanced packages not all employees will use. By contrast, Google Apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive, but may feel too awkward for those who are hard-coded to work in Office.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Matteson |title=10 comparisons between Google Apps and Office 365 |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/10-comparisons-between-google-apps-and-office-365/ |website=[[TechRepublic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Stephen Shankland of ''[[CNET]]'' wrote in 2014 that \"It's hard to compare Google Apps' success to that of Microsoft Office since Google doesn't release revenue or user figures\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Shankland |title=Google to offer schools, students unlimited storage for free |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-offers-schools-students-unlimited-storage-for-free/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|03}}, Microsoft has 60&nbsp;million commercial customers signed up for its Office 365 product offering, with \"50,000 small business customers added to Office 365 each month\".<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Callahan |title=There are now 1.2 billion Office users and 60 million Office 365 commercial customers |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers |website=Windows Central |date=March 31, 2016 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Google Cloud Platform]]\n* [[Google Drive#Google Drive for Work|Google Drive for Work]]\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]\n* [[Online office suite]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Beswick | first = James | title = Getting Productive With Google Apps | publisher = 415 Systems | location = San Francisco, CA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4404-8676-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Conner | first = Nancy | title = Google Apps: The Missing Manual | publisher = Pogue Press | location = Sebastopol | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-596-51579-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/googleappsmissin00conn }}\n* {{cite book | last = Granneman | first = Scott | title = Google Apps Deciphered: Compute in the Cloud to Streamline Your Desktop | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-13-700470-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/googleappsdeciph0000gran }}\n* [http://www.networkworld.com/article/2212301/applications/meet-the-father-of-google-apps--who-used-to-work-at-microsoft-.html Meet the father of Google Apps (who used to work at Microsoft)]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://apps.google.com/ Official website (US)]\n* [https://apps.google.com/intx/en_uk/ Official website (UK)]\n* [http://google.com/a/partnersearch Official Google Apps Partner Search]\n* [https://apps.google.com/driveforwork/ Official Google Drive for Work]\n* [https://apps.google.com/marketplace/ Official Google Apps Marketplace]\n\n{{Cloud computing}}\n{{Google Cloud}}\n\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Google Cloud|Suite]]\n[[Category:Mobile software]]\n[[Category:Online office suites]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Google Apps|applications developed by Google|List of Google products}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name = G Suite\n| logo = File:Gsuite logo.svg\n| logo size = 220\n| logo alt = gsuite logo\n| developer = [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]]\n| released = {{start date and age|2006|8|28}} (as Google Apps for Your Domain)\n| platform = [[Gmail]], [[Google Calendar|Calendar]], [[Google Currents|Currents]], [[Google Hangouts|Hangouts]], [[Google Drive|Drive]], [[Google Docs|Docs]], [[Google Sheets|Sheets]], [[Google Slides|Slides]], [[Google Keep|Keep]], [[Google Forms|Forms]], [[Google Sites|Sites]], [[Jamboard]], App Maker and Vault.\n| genre = Business Productivity, [[Brand]] and Software Suite\n| license = [[Trialware]] ([[Retail software|Retail]], [[volume licensing]], [[Software as a service]])\n| website = {{URL|gsuite.google.com}} {{URL|gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com}}\n}}\n\n'''G Suite''' is a suite of [[cloud computing]], [[Productivity software|productivity]] and [[Collaborative software|collaboration]] tools, [[software]] and products developed by [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]], first launched on August 28, 2006 as '''Google Apps for Your Domain'''.<ref name=\"Google Apps for Your Domain launch\"/> G Suite comprises [[Gmail]], [[Google Hangouts|Hangouts]], [[Google Calendar|Calendar]], and [[Google Currents|Currents]] for communication;

Bradley praised Google's collaborative apps, writing that it was \"besting what Microsoft offers in [[Office 365]]\". Regarding the price, he wrote that \"Google's package is the best value.

Conclusively, he wrote: \"The progress made between the first Google App release and now has been considerable. As the world moves to more and more mobile computing, Google has a distinct advantage.

The key differences are in the pricing plans, storage space and number of features.\n\nAs noted by ''[[TechRepublic]]'' in 2013, pricing plans differ in that \"Google Apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard Google Apps for Business package: $5 per user per month or $50 per user per year ... In contrast, Office 365 has a multitude of plans (six as of September, 2013) which can be both good and bad since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice\". Storage space varies because \"Office 365 gives users 50&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of space in [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] and 1&nbsp;TB in [[OneDrive]]. Google Apps provides 30&nbsp;GB of space which is spread among [[Gmail]], [[Google Drive|Drive]] and [[Picasa]]\". And regarding features, it states that \"Office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with Word, Excel and the rest of the gang for years; there is less of a learning curve than with Google Apps if the latter represents a brand new experience ... However, it's also true that Office is notorious for being loaded with complex, unused features which can cause confusion, so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price, especially if companies are paying for advanced packages not all employees will use. By contrast, Google Apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive, but may feel too awkward for those who are hard-coded to work in Office.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Matteson |title=10 comparisons between Google Apps and Office 365 |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/10-comparisons-between-google-apps-and-office-365/ |website=[[TechRepublic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Stephen Shankland of ''[[CNET]]'' wrote in 2014 that \"It's hard to compare Google Apps' success to that of Microsoft Office since Google doesn't release revenue or user figures\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Shankland |title=Google to offer schools, students unlimited storage for free |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-offers-schools-students-unlimited-storage-for-free/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|03}}, Microsoft has 60&nbsp;million commercial customers signed up for its Office 365 product offering, with \"50,000 small business customers added to Office 365 each month\".<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Callahan |title=There are now 1.2 billion Office users and 60 million Office 365 commercial customers |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers |website=Windows Central |date=March 31, 2016 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Google Cloud Platform]]\n* [[Google Drive#Google Drive for Work|Google Drive for Work]]\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]\n* [[Online office suite]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Beswick | first = James | title = Getting Productive With Google Apps | publisher = 415 Systems | location = San Francisco, CA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4404-8676-0 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Conner | first = Nancy | title = Google Apps: The Missing Manual | publisher = Pogue Press | location = Sebastopol | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-596-51579-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/googleappsmissin00conn }}\n* {{cite book | last = Granneman | first = Scott | title = Google Apps Deciphered: Compute in the Cloud to Streamline Your Desktop | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-13-700470-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/googleappsdeciph0000gran }}\n* [http://www.networkworld.com/article/2212301/applications/meet-the-father-of-google-apps--who-used-to-work-at-microsoft-.html Meet the father of Google Apps (who used to work at Microsoft)]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://apps.google.com/ Official website (US)]\n* [https://apps.google.com/intx/en_uk/ Official website (UK)]\n* [http://google.com/a/partnersearch Official Google Apps Partner Search]\n* [https://apps.google.com/driveforwork/ Official Google Drive for Work]\n* [https://apps.google.com/marketplace/ Official Google Apps Marketplace]\n\n{{Cloud computing}}\n{{Google Cloud}}\n\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Google Cloud|Suite]]\n[[Category:Mobile software]]\n[[Category:Online office suites]]\n", "name_user": "103.80.3.2", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(01728285771)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_Suite"}
