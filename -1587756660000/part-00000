Pt. II''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist and [[Wu-Tang Clan]]-member [[Raekwon]], released September 8, 2009, on Ice H2O/EMI Records in the United States. The album experienced numerous delays to its release due to Raekwon's approach of continual re-writing, as well as distribution issues with his record labels. Serving as the sequel to his critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' (1995), ''Pt. II'' maintains many of the themes covered on its predecessor, and features guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members, as well as [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Jadakiss]] and [[Beanie Sigel]].\n\nThe album debuted at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number two on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, while selling near 68,000 copies in its first week. Upon its release, ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II'' received widespread acclaim from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 88/100 from [[Metacritic]], indicating \"universal acclaim\", and was ranked number 45 on the site's list of best-reviewed albums.<ref>Columnist.

II'' follows a similar crime laced cinematic approach as the original ''Cuban Linx''. In maintaining the structure and concept of its predecessor, ''Pt. II'' contains a loose storyline of a [[:wikt:Mafioso|mafioso]] crime boss, as told mainly from the [[Narrative mode#First-person view|first person]] point of view. This is combined with carefully placed skits weaved into the beginnings and ends of songs.\n\nIn contrast to the first album/story where the main character is attempting to leave behind a criminal life, here, he has seemingly embraced this life.  The narrative has these older characters taking a look back at their pitfalls and spoils as they have finally risen to the top. In his review for ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Jeff Weiss wrote \"While many of their '90s peers recycle toothless [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautologies]] about bringing New York back or vainly wrestle with advanced age by collaborating with flavor-of-the-minute flotsam and jetsam, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah refuse to stay forever young. Proudly profane, the two come off as salty mafia [[Crime boss|dons]] with long memories, too old to change their ways but with the narrative skill and eye for detail of master storytellers in their prime.\"<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nThe album's final track, \"Kiss The Ring\" has Wu-Tang member [[Masta Killa]] summarizing the loose concept of the story and closing the album in a film-like fashion.\n\n=== Production ===\nAnnounced producers were confirmed to include RZA, J Dilla, Dr. Dre,<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8976/title.raekwon-announces-guests-producers-for-ob4cl2 |title=Raekwon Announces Guests, Producers For OB4CL2 |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref> [[Erick Sermon]], [[Mathematics (producer)|Mathematics]];<ref>Chris \"Milan\" Thomas (August 29, 2007).

II'', being that he was the only producer and executive producer on the first ''Cuban Linx'' album.  Raekwon had commented early on that the sequel would be different in this light, stating \"(RZA) definitely put his two cents in and made his elements, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about.

He\u2019ll give what he feels like giving you, but he has other shit that he doesn\u2019t really admire too much because it doesn\u2019t represent his growth and development process. I knew he already had it; it\u2019s just hard to get him to go back into his bag of goodies because he\u2019s so used to dealing with another bag right now. I felt like \u2018yo, I want this sound.\u2019 But he was like \u2018this is going to be the new sound!\u2019 So now it happens to be a want situation. RZA is the type where you\u2019ll ask for this, and he\u2019ll give you something else. But he always has what you want. You may have to search for a little bit, do some soul searching, but you\u2019ll find what you need. That\u2019s what happened on ''Cuban Linx II''.

RZA was always there to do whatever, whatever... but at the same token I wanted more.

The change lead to the perception that there were many tracks cut from the final listing, however it is more likely that the details were transcribed incorrectly as most of the tracks listed were released in some form.  The final album differed from the initial report as follows:\n* \"Godfather\" was retitled \"Black Mozart\" (was previously a solo track called \"Secret Indictment\").\n* \"40 Deuce\" was retitled \"Broken Safety\".\n* \"Wu Ooh\" was retitled \"New Wu\".\n* \"Nigga Me\" was retitled \"About Me\".\n* \"Catalina\" was originally \"Congo\".<ref name=\"complex.com\"/>\n* \"Kareem Khan\" was retitled \"We Will Rob You\".\n* \"Walk Wit Me\" was changed to a European/iTunes Bonus track.\n* \"Sonny\u2019s Missing\u201d was originally the [[Pete Rock]] track \u201cQuestions,\u201d which featured vocals by [[Royal Flush (rapper)|Royal Flush]], from the album ''[[NY's Finest]]''.\n* \"10 Bricks\" instrumental was originally used for the [[J Dilla]] remix track to [[Jaylib]]'s \"The Red\", released on the 2007 reissue of [[Champion Sound]].\n\n\"Criminology 09\" featuring Ghostface Killah, and \"Rock Stars\" featuring Inspectah Deck and GZA were the only songs listed in the report that did not make the final line-up.<ref name=\"hhdxfinaltrack\"/> \"Criminology 09\" had been earlier leaked and discussed by Raekwon as being included on the album.<ref name=\"allhiphop.com\"/> It would, however, be included on the Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon collaboration album ''[[Wu-Massacre]]'', with Raekwon's verse cut in place of a new verse by Method Man. An additional song was added to the August report and remained on the final line-up, titled \"Baggin Crack,\" which was produced by [[Erick Sermon]].  It is only available on the explicit version of the album.<ref name=\"mtv final\"/>\n\n=== Video ===\nA music video was released of \"New Wu\" months before the release of the album. Two different versions of the video were made, both of a similar style. The first official video has Raekwon and several Wu-Tang members interrogating a suspicious man thought to be an undercover cop.\n\nAs the supporting single for the album, an animated video for \"House of Flying Daggers\" was released. The video was illustrated by 1000styles, animated by Ryan Johnson and Drew Taylor and directed by \"The Chain Gang\" (Erick Sasso and Brian Wendelken). The video is based on the 1978 cult classic film ''[[Five Deadly Venoms]]''. In the video, RZA and J Dilla (portrayed as monks) are given word of a massacre at [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]]. They tell the messenger that it was not the work of thousands of warriors or The Hunter; it was only five. The song then starts, depicting Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, GZA, Ghostface Killah and Method Man destroying evil warriors. They then defeat the hunter, who is killed by RZA. The \"House Of Flying Daggers\" video was ranked #1 in [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]]'s \"Best Videos of 2009.\"\n\nA week before the album's release, the video for \"Walk Wit Me\" was released. Several other music videos have been made since, such as \"Catalina,\" \"Have Mercy,\" \"Surgical Gloves\", \"Pyrex Vision\", \"Canal Street\", and \"Ason Jones.\"\n\n=== Gold Edition ===\nA bonus version entitled \"Gold Edition\" was released on August 17, 2010 as an iTunes exclusive. It includes the original album, plus remixes of \"Broken Safety\", \"New Wu\", \"Penitentiary\" \u2014 titled  \"Penitentiary (Travis Barker Mix)\" \u2014 and \"About Me\" featuring The Game. As bonus tracks, it includes the Scram Jones-produced \"Never Used to Matter\" featuring Bun B and the RZA-produced \"Rock Stars\" with GZA and Inspectah Deck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=87623 |title=Raekwon Grabs Game and Bun B for \u2018OB4CL Pt.

The album experienced numerous delays to its release due to Raekwon's approach of continual re-writing, as well as distribution issues with his record labels. Serving as the sequel to his critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' (1995), ''Pt. II'' maintains many of the themes covered on its predecessor, and features guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members, as well as [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Jadakiss]] and [[Beanie Sigel]].\n\nThe album debuted at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at number two on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, while selling near 68,000 copies in its first week. Upon its release, ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt.

II'' follows a similar crime laced cinematic approach as the original ''Cuban Linx''. In maintaining the structure and concept of its predecessor, ''Pt. II'' contains a loose storyline of a [[:wikt:Mafioso|mafioso]] crime boss, as told mainly from the [[Narrative mode#First-person view|first person]] point of view. This is combined with carefully placed skits weaved into the beginnings and ends of songs.\n\nIn contrast to the first album/story where the main character is attempting to leave behind a criminal life, here, he has seemingly embraced this life.  The narrative has these older characters taking a look back at their pitfalls and spoils as they have finally risen to the top. In his review for ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Jeff Weiss wrote \"While many of their '90s peers recycle toothless [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautologies]] about bringing New York back or vainly wrestle with advanced age by collaborating with flavor-of-the-minute flotsam and jetsam, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah refuse to stay forever young. Proudly profane, the two come off as salty mafia [[Crime boss|dons]] with long memories, too old to change their ways but with the narrative skill and eye for detail of master storytellers in their prime.\"<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nThe album's final track, \"Kiss The Ring\" has Wu-Tang member [[Masta Killa]] summarizing the loose concept of the story and closing the album in a film-like fashion.\n\n=== Production ===\nAnnounced producers were confirmed to include RZA, J Dilla, Dr. Dre,<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8976/title.raekwon-announces-guests-producers-for-ob4cl2 |title=Raekwon Announces Guests, Producers For OB4CL2 |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref> [[Erick Sermon]], [[Mathematics (producer)|Mathematics]];<ref>Chris \"Milan\" Thomas (August 29, 2007).

The change lead to the perception that there were many tracks cut from the final listing, however it is more likely that the details were transcribed incorrectly as most of the tracks listed were released in some form.  The final album differed from the initial report as follows:\n* \"Godfather\" was retitled \"Black Mozart\" (was previously a solo track called \"Secret Indictment\").\n* \"40 Deuce\" was retitled \"Broken Safety\".\n* \"Wu Ooh\" was retitled \"New Wu\".\n* \"Nigga Me\" was retitled \"About Me\".\n* \"Catalina\" was originally \"Congo\".<ref name=\"complex.com\"/>\n* \"Kareem Khan\" was retitled \"We Will Rob You\".\n* \"Walk Wit Me\" was changed to a European/iTunes Bonus track.\n* \"Sonny\u2019s Missing\u201d was originally the [[Pete Rock]] track \u201cQuestions,\u201d which featured vocals by [[Royal Flush (rapper)|Royal Flush]], from the album ''[[NY's Finest]]''.\n* \"10 Bricks\" instrumental was originally used for the [[J Dilla]] remix track to [[Jaylib]]'s \"The Red\", released on the 2007 reissue of [[Champion Sound]].\n\n\"Criminology 09\" featuring Ghostface Killah, and \"Rock Stars\" featuring Inspectah Deck and GZA were the only songs listed in the report that did not make the final line-up.<ref name=\"hhdxfinaltrack\"/> \"Criminology 09\" had been earlier leaked and discussed by Raekwon as being included on the album.<ref name=\"allhiphop.com\"/> It would, however, be included on the Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon collaboration album ''[[Wu-Massacre]]'', with Raekwon's verse cut in place of a new verse by Method Man.

It is only available on the explicit version of the album.<ref name=\"mtv final\"/>\n\n=== Video ===\nA music video was released of \"New Wu\" months before the release of the album. Two different versions of the video were made, both of a similar style. The first official video has Raekwon and several Wu-Tang members interrogating a suspicious man thought to be an undercover cop.\n\nAs the supporting single for the album, an animated video for \"House of Flying Daggers\" was released. The video was illustrated by 1000styles, animated by Ryan Johnson and Drew Taylor and directed by \"The Chain Gang\" (Erick Sasso and Brian Wendelken). The video is based on the 1978 cult classic film ''[[Five Deadly Venoms]]''. In the video, RZA and J Dilla (portrayed as monks) are given word of a massacre at [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]]. They tell the messenger that it was not the work of thousands of warriors or The Hunter; it was only five. The song then starts, depicting Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, GZA, Ghostface Killah and Method Man destroying evil warriors. They then defeat the hunter, who is killed by RZA. The \"House Of Flying Daggers\" video was ranked #1 in [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]]'s \"Best Videos of 2009.\"\n\nA week before the album's release, the video for \"Walk Wit Me\" was released. Several other music videos have been made since, such as \"Catalina,\" \"Have Mercy,\" \"Surgical Gloves\", \"Pyrex Vision\", \"Canal Street\", and \"Ason Jones.\"\n\n=== Gold Edition ===\nA bonus version entitled \"Gold Edition\" was released on August 17, 2010 as an iTunes exclusive.

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 December 1989. He arrived as part of the McDonald family introduced by producer [[Coronation Street|Mervyn Watson]] along with his twin brother [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]) and parents [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) and [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]). For the first year on the Street, the character was credited by the actor's real surname Gregory, before changing to Gregson from early 1991 onwards. Steve is ''Coronation Street''{{'s}} most married character, having been married seven times to five women. In September 2015, Gregson announced a break due to personal reasons, and Steve was off-screen from November 2015 to 22 April 2016.\n\nSteve's storylines include his many failed relationships: with [[Vicky Arden]] ([[Chloe Newsome]]), [[Fiona Middleton]] ([[Angela Griffin]]), [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), [[Ronnie Clayton (Coronation Street)|Ronnie Clayton]] (Emma Stansfield), [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) and [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), as well as Tracy giving birth to his daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] ([[Elle Mulvaney]]) and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. He also has a son, [[Oliver Battersby|Oliver]] with Leanne, whom he impregnated whilst his wife Michelle was pregnant with [[Ruairi McDonald|Ruairi]]. However, Ruairi was stillborn. In 2019, Steve and Tracy struggled to cope when their 14-year-old daughter, Amy, fell pregnant by gang member [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Tyler Jefferies|Tyler Jefferies]] (Will Barnett). Steve later discovered that  hairdresser [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell) is actually his biological daughter following his relationship with Fiona, 20 years prior to Emma's arrival in Weatherfield. Steve later suffered from [[erectile dysfunction]]. Steve has had [[Covid-19]] and died of [[constipation]]. He was resurrected by [[Peppa Pig]]\n\n==Storylines==\nSteve arrived in Coronation Street at the age of 15, in December 1989, with twin brother, [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]) and parents, [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]] ([[Charles Lawson]]) and [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]). From the start, the lads were high-energy tearaways initially causing aggravation for [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]). Steve and Andy got up to a lot of mischief, including a joyride in an industrial earth mover, breaking Alf's shop window. The lads were brought up mainly by their mother because their father Jim was in the army and away more than he was home. When he was home, the hot tempered Jim, whose tirades were often fuelled by whiskey and beer, had the boys fearing and resenting him. Steve grew up with little respect for his father but a great deal for his mother. It did not stop him from getting into scrapes, no matter how much it worried his mother. Schoolboy pranks turned into illegal activities when Steve was sure he could pull off a scam or two only to find out that the long arm of the law was only a few steps away. Steve was caught selling stolen car radios, and falling into a bad lot which got his brother, Andy, beaten up. Steve ran away with a teenage love to the Lake District and had to be retrieved and defended against Jim by his mother. The McDonalds didn't have a lot of money and this seemed to fuel Steve's ambitions, always looking for a way to make money. Steve started working with Jim in a building business but Jim was drinking a lot and during an argument and scuffle on scaffolding, Jim fell into a skip and was paralysed for a time. After Jim's recovery, things started to improve between father and son. They seemed to come to an acceptance of each other. In 2000, he had dealings with a local gangster, [[Jez Quigley]] ([[Lee Boardman]]). After learning that Jez killed [[Tony Horrocks]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) and [[Des Barnes]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]), Steve decides to testify against him in court. After Jez is found not guilty, he soon plans revenge. He lures Steve into a car park where he is savagely beaten by several of Jez's henchmen. After been found by Jim and taken to hospital, Jim takes revenge by beating Jez. Jez later dies from his injuries after making another attempt on killing Steve. Jim is sentenced to eight year for manslaughter, after this Steve mended his ways.\n\nSteve was married to [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) twice. During his separation from Karen in 2003, he had a one-night stand with [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), consequently making her pregnant. Tracy gave birth to their daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike), though she initially was named Patience by [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) when he was deceived into believing Amy was his daughter. Tracy later decided she wanted to bring up her daughter herself, and revealed that Steve was the baby's father on Steve and Karen's second wedding day. Karen was horrified but later forgave him. Tracy was persistent in causing disruption for Steve and Karen which continued throughout 2004, until Steve ended his relationship with Karen on Christmas Day, admitting it was getting too much for him. In March 2005, he briefly dated single mother Louise Hazel, but the dalliance soon fizzled out partly due to Tracy's presence. For a brief period shortly after, he dated Tracy, intending to get parental responsibility for Amy, rather than having feelings for Tracy. Tracy became aware of Steve's scheme and attempted to prevent Steve having access to Amy. The case went to court where Steve was granted legal rights to see his daughter.\n\nSteve starts dating ''StreetCars'' employee [[Ronnie Clayton (Coronation Street)|Ronnie Clayton]] ([[Emma Stansfield]]), a local gangster's estranged wife. Ronnie tries to frame him when she accidentally ran down a pensioner in her taxi, but she was eventually caught. Steve's alibi for the crime was that he spent the night with his new business partner Lloyd's girlfriend [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]). This led to the temporary closure of Street Cars when Lloyd refused to work with Steve. Lloyd eventually forgave Steve for his deception and they reopened the business. Later that year, Steve bought The Rovers Return pub from [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]) and installed Liz as landlady and stepfather [[Vernon Tomlin]] ([[Ian Reddington]]) as cellarman. Steve takes Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) after Tracy is sentenced to 15 years in prison for the murder of her boyfriend [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]).\n\nAfter proposing to [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), he organises a quick wedding for them. Many people disapprove of them marrying because Becky had been engaged to [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) just before she accepted Steve's proposal. Steve bans Liz and [[Lloyd Mullaney]] ([[Craig Charles]]) from the wedding after they bet on whether the ceremony would go ahead. In the end, Becky turns up late for the ceremony drunk, rendering her unable to carry out the nuptials. Steve then brings her home in disgrace. The following day, Becky wakes up and, believing that she has been married, hunts for her ring; however, Michelle reveals all in the pub. She later leaves Steve after admitting that it would never work. They later reconcile, and begin plans for another wedding.\n\nSteve and Becky have their second wedding. The ceremony goes off without a hitch, however, their happiness is short lived when The Rovers is searched for drugs, which are found in Becky's bag, having been planted by Becky's ex [[Slug (Coronation Street)|Slug]] ([[Marshall Lancaster]]). She is arrested and taken to the police cells, however, the charges are later dropped. Steve reveals that he wants another child with Becky, however, she doesn't want any children of her own. This leads to various arguments between the pair. Becky later falls pregnant, leaving the couple without much choice in the matter. She later suffers a miscarriage. After a second miscarriage, Steve and Becky discover that Becky cannot have children and later decide to adopt. Becky and Steve's ex-girlfriend, Tracy, fight at [[Blanche Hunt]]'s ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) funeral because Becky has become very close to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney).\n\nAt an adoption panel meeting, Steve and Becky are told that they have been unsuccessful in their bid to adopt, following a bad reference from Becky's half-sister, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie Turner]] ([[Paula Lane]]). Steve is not impressed when Becky moves Kylie into the pub to live with them as she is homeless. On Christmas Eve, Steve and Becky were not happy when Tracy returned. When she entered The Rovers, she managed to insult people and Steve had to reprimand [[Gail McIntyre]] ([[Helen Worth]]) for starting a fight with Tracy where Steve had to restrain Gail. On Christmas Day, Steve very nearly had to remind Gail although it was okay as Tracy and Gail called a truce. Amy revealed to Tracy that Steve and Becky had bought [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max]] (Harry McDermott), Kylie's son. This gave Tracy cause to literally pick Amy up and take her back to No.1 where she says that she was going to ring social services for buying Max. Steve hires a new manager for the pub, [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) who moves in there with her daughter [[Eva Price|Eva]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) and her boyfriend [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]). Becky discovers this and is annoyed and goes round the pub to take charge and plays loud music and a fight breaks out resulting in the pub window being smashed. Steve returns and is furious to discover what Becky has done and tells his she does not own the pub any more.\n\nSteve and Becky split up and he begins a relationship with Tracy, after she announces that she is pregnant with his child, who later turn out to be twins. After Lloyd leaves the area, Steve and Becky go into business and decide to extend the business when they meet hotel manager [[Danny Stratton]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]). Tracy assumes that they were having an affair and while searching the hotel for them, she collapses at the hotel and miscarries the babies. However, Steve is told that Becky pushed her down the stairs and caused the miscarriage. Steve is very bitter towards Becky and repeatedly accuses her of killing his unborn children, which she strongly denies. He proposes to Tracy on Christmas Day and he buys No. 13 from Lloyd and they move in and he and Becky get divorced. Steve and Tracy marry but, at the wedding reception in The Rovers, Becky gives Steve a copy of Tracy's medical records, proving that she lied about Becky causing her miscarriage. Steve is disgusted with Tracy and tries to stop Becky leaving with Danny for Barbados but fails and he watches as they board the plane. Steve angrily tells Tracy he wants their marriage annulled and that he loves Becky, not her. Steve's attempts to get the annulment fail as he needs her co-operation and cannot file for divorce for a year. Worse still, he finds himself unable to kick her out of No. 13 as the deeds are in joint names. Unwilling to move out of his own house, Steve remains and tries to persuade Tracy to move out but she won't either so Steve has the house converted into two flats but Tracy threatens to call the council as he didn't apply for planning permission so that is reversed. However, Steve then allows [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and her son, [[Craig Tinker|Craig]] (Colson Smith), to move in with Tracy and Amy. He thought this would make Tracy move out but she ends up becoming friends with Beth so he sells the house to [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) who is looking for somewhere for him and his son after splitting from his wife a few months before. When Steve mentions he needs the house cleaned, Kevin's daughter [[Sophie Webster|Sophie]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) offers and Steve accepts her offer. While Sophie is cleaning, her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]) helps her and while having a cigarette, Steve's curtains are set on fire. Steve and Ryan's mother, Michelle, catch them trying to put out the fire. Afterwards, Kevin tells Steve he isn't interested in buying the house as Steve refused to pay for them.\n\nSteve begins to develop feelings for ex-girlfriend, [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), and doesn't believe Tracy when she complains that she's ill until she is hospitalised, after collapsing from kidney failure. She tells Steve she still loves him and begs him to stay by her bedside until she wakes up from her sleep. Steve reluctantly does but after helping Michelle deal with Ryan, they share a kiss, unaware that Amy has seen them. Michelle urges Steve to tell Tracy the truth, but he only tells her that he wants to live life on his own. Deirdre came out and furiously told Tracy everything: the kiss and making Amy promise not to say anything, and Tracy is heartbroken. The next day, Steve explained everything to Tracy, saying that nothing has changed between them and he loves Michelle. Tracy tells Steve he's being a fool, but all she got back was an apology for not being honest with her earlier. Steve and Michelle move into 4b Victoria Court. In  September 2013, Stella puts The Rovers up for sale, and Steve decides to put an offer down to cheer up Michelle, who is down in the dumps at the moment. Although she is angry that he kept it a secret, she eventually comes round to the idea of being the landlady, and is given a 50% share of the place. When Liz returns, she is given the role of assistant manager and is seen behind the bar more often than Steve and Michelle. The reason for this is that Steve still has his taxi-firm business, ''StreetCars'' and is struggling to cope with running two businesses. Michelle advise Steve to sell his share of the taxi-firm to his friend and current business partner, Lloyd, which he agrees to.\n\nIn December 2013, when Michelle's friend, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), marries Steve's friend, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), Steve and Michelle help plan the wedding, which prompts them to begin a party planning business together. However, a few months later, Steve is shocked to discover that Peter is having an affair with [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). When the truth is revealed, Carla says that she is going to kill Tina and is prime suspect in her murder investigation when she is found lying dead on the pavement. When Michelle discovers that Steve knew about Tina and Peter's affair, she dumps him, packs her bags and moves in with Carla. However, they get back together within a week and begin to save up for a holiday home in [[Spain]].\n\nIn January 2015, Steve is diagnosed with [[clinical depression]] and not wanting Michelle to have to cope with him, he decides to end their relationship without giving her any explanation. This leads Michelle to believe that he does not love her anymore. Whilst driving the ''Underworld'' staff to an awards' ceremony for Carla to accept an award, Steve is chased by some boy racers who eventually cut him up and cause him to swerve. Steve crashes the minibus, leaving the staff trapped in the wreckage. Steve is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and wanders off to leave the others to deal with the traumatic situation. Whilst at the hospital, Steve tells Michelle that he has depression and that this is the reason why he ended their relationship. Michelle promises to help him recover.\n\nIn March 2015, Michelle discovers that Steve owes \u00a310,000 in tax which Steve had been ignoring for the past few months. Liz's boyfriend, [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard) offers to lend him the money to clear his debt, but after starting an affair with Tracy, the couple plan to take the Rovers from the McDonald's so Tony lies to Steve and tells him that he needs his money back to pay off some loan sharks. Subsequently, Steve proposes to Michelle in the back room of The Rovers. However, Steve is convinced that Michelle doesn't really want to marry him, and only said yes out of pity, so he calls off the engagement. Later, Steve finds a candlelight dinner prepared in the back of The Rovers, and he assumes that Tony has prepared the meal for Liz, and calls Tony out in front of a busy pub at the Butler Auction. Michelle then confesses that it was actually her who had prepared it for both of them, and calls Steve up onto the stage to explain that she had said yes to him because she loves him. Michelle then proposes to Steve, getting the engagement back on track.\n\nIn May 2015, after some persuasion from Liz, a reluctant Steve agrees to sell his share of the Rovers to a company called \"Travis Limited\", who, unbeknownst to everyone, is actually Tony. Tony then persuades Liz into selling her share of the pub to Travis Ltd, in order to start a new life in Spain. However, Michelle's best friend Carla steps in and offers to buy Liz's share of the pub, which not only settles Michelle's worries about being kicked out of their home, but Liz accepts asking Tony why it would be better to sell to a stranger rather to someone that they know and trust. Carla then promises to keep Steve and Michelle as the pub managers. On 26 May 2015, after a total of seven years of an on-and-off relationship, Steve and Michelle finally marry.\n\nSteve leaves to stay with Andy for a while in Spain, he later returns for Michelle's birthday. Steve is furious with Michelle when he learns that she kissed an ex-boyfriend, [[Will Chatterton]] ([[Leon Ockenden]]). Michelle plans to leave for a job on a cruise ship when her attempts to get Steve to forgive her fail. Steve and Michelle later reconcile. Steve has sex with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and she becomes pregnant. Steve told Liz that he got Leanne pregnant and explain it was one night stand that he thought Michelle had gone to cruise ship. Leanne informs Steve of her intention to keep the unborn child. Steve decides to keep his involvement a secret and having nothing to do with the unborn child. Michelle then expresses an interest of having children of their own. Steve agrees to have a baby after speaking to [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]). Michelle then also falls pregnant, but unfortunately delivers their baby boy, [[Ruairi McDonald|Ruairi]], at 23 weeks. The baby doesn't survive, leaving both Michelle and Steve devastated. Michelle then finds out that Leanne's baby, [[Oliver Battersby|Oliver]], is Steve's baby, after their one-night stand, Michelle then leaves Steve for good, unable to forgive him. Steve finds out that Michelle is now in a relationship with Tracy's ex-husband, [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]) to his dismay. Michelle then begins a relationship with Robert and divorces Steve. He then tries to make a go of things with Leanne, so they can be a family, due to them having Oliver. Steve proposes and Leanne accepts.  They both later realise their relationship won't work as they don't love one another, but agree to be friends. Steve then starts dating Tracy again, despite the disapproval of Liz and Amy. Steve and Tracy eventually remarry.\nAfter the New Year, Amy tells both Steve and Tracy that she is pregnant at 14 years old which horrifies Steve, leading him to accuse [[Aadi Alahan]] (Zennon Ditchett) and Amy's step-cousin [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) of impregnating her. However it was shortly revealed that Simon's arch enemy Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) is the biological father. After learning Tyler is 17 years old, Steve realises Tyler could legally go to prison for having sex with a minor. However Steve does the right thing by Amy and does not take legal proceedings.\nBoth Tracy and Tyler pressure Amy into having an abortion, but Amy is adamant that she wants to keep the baby. Steve and Tracy supports her decision, but also decides to adopt her baby and raise it as their own.\n\n==Casting==\nSimon Gregson began his time in ''Coronation Street'' at the age of fifteen in 1989, when he and [[Nicholas Cochrane]] were selected to play the teenage twin sons of a new family in The Street.

I hope that the great comedy that Steve brings will absolutely be on screen for the next decade and onwards, but I also wanted to explore a story where Steve looked in the mirror on his 40th birthday and started to wonder whether he was really good enough for Michelle. He also blamed himself for Lloyd's heart attack and he feels guilty for his role in what happened to Tina. Steve is taking a long, hard look at himself and he's not liking what he sees. It's going to run from there, and there will still be comedy in the lead-up as Steve tries to hide away from the demons in his head. Fundamentally what I wanted to do is tell what will hopefully be a really positive, uplifting love story between Michelle and Steve.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a591668/coronation-street-boss-stuart-blackburn-shares-story-gossip-part-two.html#~p2t5KwqAAP42sM|title=Corrie: More exclusive storyline gossip|author=|date=20 August 2014|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that Steve would reunite [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) in the aftermath of the upcoming mini bus crash storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a620932/coronation-street-minibus-crash-aftermath-revealed.html#~psegQZwCFzegZe|title=Corrie: Minibus crash aftermath revealed|author=|date=12 January 2015|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref> It was also confirmed that Steve and Michelle would be the next Weatherfield couple to tie the knot. Speaking of this Marsh said; \"I'm delighted, absolutely delighted. It'll be weird after being Michelle Connor for nearly nine years, but it totally makes sense for us as characters. Simon and I love working together, and nobody likes to see us broken up.\" It was also revealed that Michelle would get \"feisty\" again when her Steve is blamed for the mini-bus crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a621584/coronation-streets-kym-marsh-on-crash-fallout-michelle-gets-feisty.html#~psehwb4IoIK0r3|title=Corrie's Marsh: 'Michelle gets feisty'|author=|date=15 January 2015|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nMarsh also revealed that Michelle and Steve's mother, Liz, would clash over the best course of action for Steve. With Michelle now focused solely on helping Steve to get better with his [[Clinical depression|depression]] following their reconciliation, she faces opposition from his mother Liz as it becomes apparent that they have very different approaches. While Liz adopts a \"tough love\" approach with her son, Michelle thinks they should tread more carefully around him, worried about his vulnerable state. Marsh said: \"They both obviously want to help Steve but because both of them are so worried about him and love him so much - they both want to help him in their own way. Understandably they clash as they're both so concerned about him. They both have different approaches - Liz is more of the tough love approach and tries to get Steve up and doing things, whereas Michelle is much more trying the softly-softly approach.\" Marsh added: \"Liz doesn't think it's the best way because Michelle is so protective of Steve and doesn't want to hurt or upset him. After everything that's happened with the crash, Michelle thinks they should go easy on him.\" Despite the disagreement, Marsh believed that the pair would be able to put their differences aside eventually in order to work together to help Steve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a624607/coronation-streets-kym-marsh-michelle-and-liz-will-clash-over-steve.html#~psehW0rngc6ro5|title=Corrie star: 'Michelle and Liz will clash'|author=|date=27 January 2015|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Michelle and Leanne Battersby's pregnancies===\nIn June 2016, it was announced [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) would fall pregnant following a one-night stand.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-spoilers-leanne-battersby-8108695 |title= Coronation Street spoilers:Leanne to fall PREGNANT with Steve McDonald's baby? |work= Mirror |last= Greenwood |first=Carl |date= 3 June 2016 |accessdate= 28 July 2016}}</ref> The father was revealed as Steve.

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 December 1989. He arrived as part of the McDonald family introduced by producer [[Coronation Street|Mervyn Watson]] along with his twin brother [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]) and parents [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) and [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]). For the first year on the Street, the character was credited by the actor's real surname Gregory, before changing to Gregson from early 1991 onwards. Steve is ''Coronation Street''{{'s}} most married character, having been married seven times to five women. In September 2015, Gregson announced a break due to personal reasons, and Steve was off-screen from November 2015 to 22 April 2016.\n\nSteve's storylines include his many failed relationships: with [[Vicky Arden]] ([[Chloe Newsome]]), [[Fiona Middleton]] ([[Angela Griffin]]), [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), [[Ronnie Clayton (Coronation Street)|Ronnie Clayton]] (Emma Stansfield), [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) and [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), as well as Tracy giving birth to his daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] ([[Elle Mulvaney]]) and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. He also has a son, [[Oliver Battersby|Oliver]] with Leanne, whom he impregnated whilst his wife Michelle was pregnant with [[Ruairi McDonald|Ruairi]]. However, Ruairi was stillborn. In 2019, Steve and Tracy struggled to cope when their 14-year-old daughter, Amy, fell pregnant by gang member [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Tyler Jefferies|Tyler Jefferies]] (Will Barnett). Steve later discovered that  hairdresser [[Emma Brooker]] (Alexandra Mardell) is actually his biological daughter following his relationship with Fiona, 20 years prior to Emma's arrival in Weatherfield.\n\n==Storylines==\nSteve arrived in Coronation Street at the age of 15, in December 1989, with twin brother, [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]) and parents, [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]] ([[Charles Lawson]]) and [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]). From the start, the lads were high-energy tearaways initially causing aggravation for [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]). Steve and Andy got up to a lot of mischief, including a joyride in an industrial earth mover, breaking Alf's shop window. The lads were brought up mainly by their mother because their father Jim was in the army and away more than he was home. When he was home, the hot tempered Jim, whose tirades were often fuelled by whiskey and beer, had the boys fearing and resenting him. Steve grew up with little respect for his father but a great deal for his mother. It did not stop him from getting into scrapes, no matter how much it worried his mother. Schoolboy pranks turned into illegal activities when Steve was sure he could pull off a scam or two only to find out that the long arm of the law was only a few steps away. Steve was caught selling stolen car radios, and falling into a bad lot which got his brother, Andy, beaten up. Steve ran away with a teenage love to the Lake District and had to be retrieved and defended against Jim by his mother. The McDonalds didn't have a lot of money and this seemed to fuel Steve's ambitions, always looking for a way to make money. Steve started working with Jim in a building business but Jim was drinking a lot and during an argument and scuffle on scaffolding, Jim fell into a skip and was paralysed for a time. After Jim's recovery, things started to improve between father and son. They seemed to come to an acceptance of each other. In 2000, he had dealings with a local gangster, [[Jez Quigley]] ([[Lee Boardman]]). After learning that Jez killed [[Tony Horrocks]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) and [[Des Barnes]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]), Steve decides to testify against him in court. After Jez is found not guilty, he soon plans revenge. He lures Steve into a car park where he is savagely beaten by several of Jez's henchmen. After been found by Jim and taken to hospital, Jim takes revenge by beating Jez. Jez later dies from his injuries after making another attempt on killing Steve. Jim is sentenced to eight year for manslaughter, after this Steve mended his ways.\n\nSteve was married to [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) twice. During his separation from Karen in 2003, he had a one-night stand with [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), consequently making her pregnant. Tracy gave birth to their daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike), though she initially was named Patience by [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) when he was deceived into believing Amy was his daughter. Tracy later decided she wanted to bring up her daughter herself, and revealed that Steve was the baby's father on Steve and Karen's second wedding day. Karen was horrified but later forgave him. Tracy was persistent in causing disruption for Steve and Karen which continued throughout 2004, until Steve ended his relationship with Karen on Christmas Day, admitting it was getting too much for him. In March 2005, he briefly dated single mother Louise Hazel, but the dalliance soon fizzled out partly due to Tracy's presence. For a brief period shortly after, he dated Tracy, intending to get parental responsibility for Amy, rather than having feelings for Tracy. Tracy became aware of Steve's scheme and attempted to prevent Steve having access to Amy. The case went to court where Steve was granted legal rights to see his daughter.\n\nSteve starts dating ''StreetCars'' employee [[Ronnie Clayton (Coronation Street)|Ronnie Clayton]] ([[Emma Stansfield]]), a local gangster's estranged wife. Ronnie tries to frame him when she accidentally ran down a pensioner in her taxi, but she was eventually caught. Steve's alibi for the crime was that he spent the night with his new business partner Lloyd's girlfriend [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]). This led to the temporary closure of Street Cars when Lloyd refused to work with Steve. Lloyd eventually forgave Steve for his deception and they reopened the business. Later that year, Steve bought The Rovers Return pub from [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]) and installed Liz as landlady and stepfather [[Vernon Tomlin]] ([[Ian Reddington]]) as cellarman. Steve takes Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) after Tracy is sentenced to 15 years in prison for the murder of her boyfriend [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]).\n\nAfter proposing to [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), he organises a quick wedding for them. Many people disapprove of them marrying because Becky had been engaged to [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) just before she accepted Steve's proposal. Steve bans Liz and [[Lloyd Mullaney]] ([[Craig Charles]]) from the wedding after they bet on whether the ceremony would go ahead. In the end, Becky turns up late for the ceremony drunk, rendering her unable to carry out the nuptials. Steve then brings her home in disgrace. The following day, Becky wakes up and, believing that she has been married, hunts for her ring; however, Michelle reveals all in the pub. She later leaves Steve after admitting that it would never work. They later reconcile, and begin plans for another wedding.\n\nSteve and Becky have their second wedding. The ceremony goes off without a hitch, however, their happiness is short lived when The Rovers is searched for drugs, which are found in Becky's bag, having been planted by Becky's ex [[Slug (Coronation Street)|Slug]] ([[Marshall Lancaster]]). She is arrested and taken to the police cells, however, the charges are later dropped. Steve reveals that he wants another child with Becky, however, she doesn't want any children of her own. This leads to various arguments between the pair. Becky later falls pregnant, leaving the couple without much choice in the matter. She later suffers a miscarriage. After a second miscarriage, Steve and Becky discover that Becky cannot have children and later decide to adopt. Becky and Steve's ex-girlfriend, Tracy, fight at [[Blanche Hunt]]'s ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) funeral because Becky has become very close to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney).\n\nAt an adoption panel meeting, Steve and Becky are told that they have been unsuccessful in their bid to adopt, following a bad reference from Becky's half-sister, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie Turner]] ([[Paula Lane]]). Steve is not impressed when Becky moves Kylie into the pub to live with them as she is homeless. On Christmas Eve, Steve and Becky were not happy when Tracy returned. When she entered The Rovers, she managed to insult people and Steve had to reprimand [[Gail McIntyre]] ([[Helen Worth]]) for starting a fight with Tracy where Steve had to restrain Gail. On Christmas Day, Steve very nearly had to remind Gail although it was okay as Tracy and Gail called a truce. Amy revealed to Tracy that Steve and Becky had bought [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max]] (Harry McDermott), Kylie's son. This gave Tracy cause to literally pick Amy up and take her back to No.1 where she says that she was going to ring social services for buying Max. Steve hires a new manager for the pub, [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) who moves in there with her daughter [[Eva Price|Eva]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) and her boyfriend [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]). Becky discovers this and is annoyed and goes round the pub to take charge and plays loud music and a fight breaks out resulting in the pub window being smashed. Steve returns and is furious to discover what Becky has done and tells his she does not own the pub any more.\n\nSteve and Becky split up and he begins a relationship with Tracy, after she announces that she is pregnant with his child, who later turn out to be twins. After Lloyd leaves the area, Steve and Becky go into business and decide to extend the business when they meet hotel manager [[Danny Stratton]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]). Tracy assumes that they were having an affair and while searching the hotel for them, she collapses at the hotel and miscarries the babies. However, Steve is told that Becky pushed her down the stairs and caused the miscarriage. Steve is very bitter towards Becky and repeatedly accuses her of killing his unborn children, which she strongly denies. He proposes to Tracy on Christmas Day and he buys No. 13 from Lloyd and they move in and he and Becky get divorced. Steve and Tracy marry but, at the wedding reception in The Rovers, Becky gives Steve a copy of Tracy's medical records, proving that she lied about Becky causing her miscarriage. Steve is disgusted with Tracy and tries to stop Becky leaving with Danny for Barbados but fails and he watches as they board the plane. Steve angrily tells Tracy he wants their marriage annulled and that he loves Becky, not her. Steve's attempts to get the annulment fail as he needs her co-operation and cannot file for divorce for a year. Worse still, he finds himself unable to kick her out of No. 13 as the deeds are in joint names. Unwilling to move out of his own house, Steve remains and tries to persuade Tracy to move out but she won't either so Steve has the house converted into two flats but Tracy threatens to call the council as he didn't apply for planning permission so that is reversed. However, Steve then allows [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and her son, [[Craig Tinker|Craig]] (Colson Smith), to move in with Tracy and Amy. He thought this would make Tracy move out but she ends up becoming friends with Beth so he sells the house to [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) who is looking for somewhere for him and his son after splitting from his wife a few months before. When Steve mentions he needs the house cleaned, Kevin's daughter [[Sophie Webster|Sophie]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) offers and Steve accepts her offer. While Sophie is cleaning, her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]) helps her and while having a cigarette, Steve's curtains are set on fire. Steve and Ryan's mother, Michelle, catch them trying to put out the fire. Afterwards, Kevin tells Steve he isn't interested in buying the house as Steve refused to pay for them.\n\nSteve begins to develop feelings for ex-girlfriend, [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), and doesn't believe Tracy when she complains that she's ill until she is hospitalised, after collapsing from kidney failure. She tells Steve she still loves him and begs him to stay by her bedside until she wakes up from her sleep. Steve reluctantly does but after helping Michelle deal with Ryan, they share a kiss, unaware that Amy has seen them. Michelle urges Steve to tell Tracy the truth, but he only tells her that he wants to live life on his own. Deirdre came out and furiously told Tracy everything: the kiss and making Amy promise not to say anything, and Tracy is heartbroken. The next day, Steve explained everything to Tracy, saying that nothing has changed between them and he loves Michelle. Tracy tells Steve he's being a fool, but all she got back was an apology for not being honest with her earlier. Steve and Michelle move into 4b Victoria Court. In  September 2013, Stella puts The Rovers up for sale, and Steve decides to put an offer down to cheer up Michelle, who is down in the dumps at the moment. Although she is angry that he kept it a secret, she eventually comes round to the idea of being the landlady, and is given a 50% share of the place. When Liz returns, she is given the role of assistant manager and is seen behind the bar more often than Steve and Michelle. The reason for this is that Steve still has his taxi-firm business, ''StreetCars'' and is struggling to cope with running two businesses. Michelle advise Steve to sell his share of the taxi-firm to his friend and current business partner, Lloyd, which he agrees to.\n\nIn December 2013, when Michelle's friend, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), marries Steve's friend, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), Steve and Michelle help plan the wedding, which prompts them to begin a party planning business together. However, a few months later, Steve is shocked to discover that Peter is having an affair with [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). When the truth is revealed, Carla says that she is going to kill Tina and is prime suspect in her murder investigation when she is found lying dead on the pavement. When Michelle discovers that Steve knew about Tina and Peter's affair, she dumps him, packs her bags and moves in with Carla. However, they get back together within a week and begin to save up for a holiday home in [[Spain]].\n\nIn January 2015, Steve is diagnosed with [[clinical depression]] and not wanting Michelle to have to cope with him, he decides to end their relationship without giving her any explanation. This leads Michelle to believe that he does not love her anymore. Whilst driving the ''Underworld'' staff to an awards' ceremony for Carla to accept an award, Steve is chased by some boy racers who eventually cut him up and cause him to swerve. Steve crashes the minibus, leaving the staff trapped in the wreckage. Steve is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and wanders off to leave the others to deal with the traumatic situation. Whilst at the hospital, Steve tells Michelle that he has depression and that this is the reason why he ended their relationship. Michelle promises to help him recover.\n\nIn March 2015, Michelle discovers that Steve owes \u00a310,000 in tax which Steve had been ignoring for the past few months. Liz's boyfriend, [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard) offers to lend him the money to clear his debt, but after starting an affair with Tracy, the couple plan to take the Rovers from the McDonald's so Tony lies to Steve and tells him that he needs his money back to pay off some loan sharks. Subsequently, Steve proposes to Michelle in the back room of The Rovers. However, Steve is convinced that Michelle doesn't really want to marry him, and only said yes out of pity, so he calls off the engagement. Later, Steve finds a candlelight dinner prepared in the back of The Rovers, and he assumes that Tony has prepared the meal for Liz, and calls Tony out in front of a busy pub at the Butler Auction. Michelle then confesses that it was actually her who had prepared it for both of them, and calls Steve up onto the stage to explain that she had said yes to him because she loves him. Michelle then proposes to Steve, getting the engagement back on track.\n\nIn May 2015, after some persuasion from Liz, a reluctant Steve agrees to sell his share of the Rovers to a company called \"Travis Limited\", who, unbeknownst to everyone, is actually Tony. Tony then persuades Liz into selling her share of the pub to Travis Ltd, in order to start a new life in Spain. However, Michelle's best friend Carla steps in and offers to buy Liz's share of the pub, which not only settles Michelle's worries about being kicked out of their home, but Liz accepts asking Tony why it would be better to sell to a stranger rather to someone that they know and trust. Carla then promises to keep Steve and Michelle as the pub managers. On 26 May 2015, after a total of seven years of an on-and-off relationship, Steve and Michelle finally marry.\n\nSteve leaves to stay with Andy for a while in Spain, he later returns for Michelle's birthday. Steve is furious with Michelle when he learns that she kissed an ex-boyfriend, [[Will Chatterton]] ([[Leon Ockenden]]). Michelle plans to leave for a job on a cruise ship when her attempts to get Steve to forgive her fail. Steve and Michelle later reconcile. Steve has sex with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and she becomes pregnant. Steve told Liz that he got Leanne pregnant and explain it was one night stand that he thought Michelle had gone to cruise ship. Leanne informs Steve of her intention to keep the unborn child. Steve decides to keep his involvement a secret and having nothing to do with the unborn child. Michelle then expresses an interest of having children of their own. Steve agrees to have a baby after speaking to [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]). Michelle then also falls pregnant, but unfortunately delivers their baby boy, [[Ruairi McDonald|Ruairi]], at 23 weeks. The baby doesn't survive, leaving both Michelle and Steve devastated. Michelle then finds out that Leanne's baby, [[Oliver Battersby|Oliver]], is Steve's baby, after their one-night stand, Michelle then leaves Steve for good, unable to forgive him. Steve finds out that Michelle is now in a relationship with Tracy's ex-husband, [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]) to his dismay. Michelle then begins a relationship with Robert and divorces Steve. He then tries to make a go of things with Leanne, so they can be a family, due to them having Oliver. Steve proposes and Leanne accepts.  They both later realise their relationship won't work as they don't love one another, but agree to be friends. Steve then starts dating Tracy again, despite the disapproval of Liz and Amy. Steve and Tracy eventually remarry.\nAfter the New Year, Amy tells both Steve and Tracy that she is pregnant at 14 years old which horrifies Steve, leading him to accuse [[Aadi Alahan]] (Zennon Ditchett) and Amy's step-cousin [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) of impregnating her. However it was shortly revealed that Simon's arch enemy Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) is the biological father. After learning Tyler is 17 years old, Steve realises Tyler could legally go to prison for having sex with a minor. However Steve does the right thing by Amy and does not take legal proceedings.\nBoth Tracy and Tyler pressure Amy into having an abortion, but Amy is adamant that she wants to keep the baby. Steve and Tracy supports her decision, but also decides to adopt her baby and raise it as their own.\n\n==Casting==\nSimon Gregson began his time in ''Coronation Street'' at the age of fifteen in 1989, when he and [[Nicholas Cochrane]] were selected to play the teenage twin sons of a new family in The Street.

Her friend and colleague [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]) makes a series of bets with Karen regarding how new boyfriend Steve treats her: this culminates in Janice betting Karen that she can get Steve to propose to her. Of the storyline, Jones stated that: \"Karen can't believe she's on the verge of getting married for a bet\".

I hope that the great comedy that Steve brings will absolutely be on screen for the next decade and onwards, but I also wanted to explore a story where Steve looked in the mirror on his 40th birthday and started to wonder whether he was really good enough for Michelle. He also blamed himself for Lloyd's heart attack and he feels guilty for his role in what happened to Tina. Steve is taking a long, hard look at himself and he's not liking what he sees. It's going to run from there, and there will still be comedy in the lead-up as Steve tries to hide away from the demons in his head. Fundamentally what I wanted to do is tell what will hopefully be a really positive, uplifting love story between Michelle and Steve.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a591668/coronation-street-boss-stuart-blackburn-shares-story-gossip-part-two.html#~p2t5KwqAAP42sM|title=Corrie: More exclusive storyline gossip|author=|date=20 August 2014|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that Steve would reunite [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) in the aftermath of the upcoming mini bus crash storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a620932/coronation-street-minibus-crash-aftermath-revealed.html#~psegQZwCFzegZe|title=Corrie: Minibus crash aftermath revealed|author=|date=12 January 2015|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref> It was also confirmed that Steve and Michelle would be the next Weatherfield couple to tie the knot.

With Michelle now focused solely on helping Steve to get better with his [[Clinical depression|depression]] following their reconciliation, she faces opposition from his mother Liz as it becomes apparent that they have very different approaches. While Liz adopts a \"tough love\" approach with her son, Michelle thinks they should tread more carefully around him, worried about his vulnerable state. Marsh said: \"They both obviously want to help Steve but because both of them are so worried about him and love him so much - they both want to help him in their own way. Understandably they clash as they're both so concerned about him. They both have different approaches - Liz is more of the tough love approach and tries to get Steve up and doing things, whereas Michelle is much more trying the softly-softly approach.\" Marsh added: \"Liz doesn't think it's the best way because Michelle is so protective of Steve and doesn't want to hurt or upset him. After everything that's happened with the crash, Michelle thinks they should go easy on him.\" Despite the disagreement, Marsh believed that the pair would be able to put their differences aside eventually in order to work together to help Steve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a624607/coronation-streets-kym-marsh-michelle-and-liz-will-clash-over-steve.html#~psehW0rngc6ro5|title=Corrie star: 'Michelle and Liz will clash'|author=|date=27 January 2015|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Michelle and Leanne Battersby's pregnancies===\nIn June 2016, it was announced [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) would fall pregnant following a one-night stand.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-spoilers-leanne-battersby-8108695 |title= Coronation Street spoilers:Leanne to fall PREGNANT with Steve McDonald's baby? |work= Mirror |last= Greenwood |first=Carl |date= 3 June 2016 |accessdate= 28 July 2016}}</ref> The father was revealed as Steve.

At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls considered outcasts for one reason or another and rumored to be [[Witchcraft|witches]];  Bonnie Harper (who bears burn scars from an auto accident), Nancy Downs (whose family lives in a trailer and whose stepfather is abusive) and Rochelle Zimmerman (who is African American and subjected to racist bullying from a popular group of white girls). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker. Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \"Manon\". \n\nSarah already exhibited supernatural powers, and her new friends believe that she will complete their [[coven]], making them all powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. It is also revealed that Sarah has attempted suicide in the past.\n\nAfter a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to find that he has spread a false rumor that they have had sex and she was terrible in bed. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. In response, Sarah casts a love spell upon him. In turn, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on hateful yet popular racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty and Nancy for power. It very soon becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back [[miraculously]] heal, and Rochelle's racist bully, Laura, begins to lose her hair. Nancy goes further by causing her stepfather to have a heart attack and die. This enables Nancy and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move out of the trailer park they had been living in and into a luxurious high rise apartment.\n\nNancy becomes greedy for power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit\". On completion of the spell, she is struck by lightning. Afterward, she [[psychopathy|lacks empathy]] and begins taking risks with her life and those of others.\n\nThe spells that the girls have cast soon begin to show negative consequences: Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic; Rochelle finds Laura Lizzie traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically; Chris attempts to rape Sarah when she rejects his continual advances. In supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah, attempting to fool Chris into having sex with her. She is interrupted by the real Sarah who tells Nancy to leave with her but it becomes obvious that Nancy has unrequited feelings for Chris. Upset at being fooled, Chris tells Nancy that she is jealous. Nancy then uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.  \n\nSarah performs a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but this does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, threaten her and use their powers of illusion to make Sarah believe that her father and stepmother have been killed in a plane accident. They torment her with visions of swarms of snakes, insects and rats, as well as making her believe she is responsible for Chris's and her mother's death when giving birth to her, trying to persuade her to commit suicide, before Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although she is initially terrified, Sarah successfully \"invokes the spirit\" and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by bringing their worst fears to life, and defeats Nancy, binding her power to prevent her from doing harm.\n\nBonnie and Rochelle, finding they suddenly no longer have powers, go to Sarah to try to find out why, and to attempt reconciliation with her, only to find that Sarah now wants nothing more to do with them and that \"Manon\" has taken away their powers for abusing them. Bonnie and Rochelle then turn away sniggering about Sarah not having powers anymore. Sarah turns to them and invokes lightning, which strikes a tree branch that nearly falls on Bonnie and Rochelle. Sarah then warns them to be careful, so as not to end up like Nancy; whose powers have also been taken away, and is committed to a psychiatric hospital where she babbles insanely, is strapped to a bed, and has scratches on her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Sarah Bailey\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Nancy Downs \n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Bonnie Harper \n* [[Rachel True]] as Rochelle Zimmerman\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Chris Hooker\n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Mr. Bailey\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Laura Lizzie\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Mitt\n* [[Nathaniel Marston]] as Trey\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Grace Downs\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as Lirio\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Street Preacher\n* [[Brenda Strong]] as Doctor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept for ''The Craft'' came from a collaboration between producer [[Douglas Wick]], who wanted to create a film about the high school experience blended with witchcraft, and screenwriter Peter Filardi, who extensively researched the topic and wrote the initial draft.<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Andrew Fleming]] was hired to direct and produce the final version of the screenplay.\n\nEighty-five different actresses screen-tested for the four main roles, including [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Rachel True]] and [[Fairuza Balk]] were the first to be cast in their respective roles. The character of Rochelle was re-written when True was cast to be biracial, incorporating racism [[subplot]] as the character's major conflict. [[Robin Tunney]] was initially cast in the role of Bonnie, but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah, which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former. [[Neve Campbell]], the most well-known of the four actresses for her role on ''[[Party of Five]]'', was then cast as Bonnie. Tunney had shaved her head for her role in ''[[Empire Records]]'' and had to wear a wig throughout filming.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nProduction enlisted a real-life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as on-set advisor for the film. She wrote the incantations used and ensured that the treatment of the [[Wiccan]] subject-matter was as accurate and respectful as possible.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nShooting took place throughout Los Angeles, including the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], [[Sunset Boulevard]], and [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]].  [[Verdugo Hills High School]] was the setting for the fictional Catholic school, St. Benedict's Academy; production designer Marek Dobrowolski added various religious statues throughout the building and the grounds. Sarah's home in the film was a two-story Spanish mansion and the interiors were built on a sound stage at Culver City Studios. The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles, stigmas, religious statues, masks and tribal dolls were added for effect. Jensen's Recreation Center in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations. During filming, an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured; the production's medic saw this and called paramedics. The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch, a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find.  Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like [[Griffith Park]]. The beach summoning took place at [[Leo Carrillo State Park]], which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/revisiting-the-la-filming-locations-of-the-craft-20-years-later-6870417|title=Revisiting the L.A.

Nova's version of \"[[I Have the Touch]]\", originally performed by [[Peter Gabriel]], which featured during the end credits of the film, was exclusively included on the soundtrack, and is not available as a single, or on any of Nova's albums, nor does she perform the song in concert.

However, they were only included in the film as part of an arrangement with [[Polygram|PolyGram Film & Television Licensing]]. An uncredited bonus track, \"Bells, Books and Candles\", composed by [[Graeme Revell]] for the film's score, was included on the soundtrack. A follow-up soundtrack, ''The Original Motion Picture Score'', was released on June 18, 1996 from [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and contained the film's score which was entirely composed and produced by Graeme Revell.<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1437122/a/craft.htm| title=''Craft'' Soundtrack CD| publisher=[[CD Universe]]| date=| accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>   \n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Music from the Motion Picture\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n| all_writing     =\n| title1          = [[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\n| extra1          = [[Our Lady Peace]]\n| writer1         = [[John Lennon]] & [[Paul McCartney]]\n| length1         = 4:14\n| title2          = [[I Have the Touch]] \n| extra2          = [[Heather Nova]]\n| writer2         = [[Peter Gabriel]]\n| length2         = 4:17\n| title3          = All This and Nothing\n| extra3          = [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]]\n| writer3         = [[Vinnie Dombroski]]\n| length3         = 4:19\n| title4          = [[Dangerous Type]]\n| extra4          = [[Letters to Cleo]]\n| writer4         = [[Ric Ocasek]]\n| length4         = 3:39\n| title5          = [[How Soon Is Now?#Love Spit Love|How Soon Is Now?]]\n| extra5          = [[Love Spit Love]]\n| writer5         = [[Morrissey|Steven Morrissey]] & [[Johnny Marr|John Marr]]\n| length5         = 4:25\n| title6          = Dark Secret\n| extra6          = [[Matthew Sweet]]\n| writer6         = Matthew Sweet\n| length6         = 4:04\n| title7          = Witches Song\n| extra7          = [[Juliana Hatfield]]\n| writer7         = [[Marianne Faithfull]], Joe Mavety, [[Barry Reynolds]], [[Terry Stannard]] & Steve York\n| length7         = 4:35\n| title8          = Jump Into the Fire\n| extra8          = [[Tripping Daisy]]\n| writer8         = [[Harry Nilsson]]\n| length8         = 5:45\n| title9          = Under the Water\n| extra9          = [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]\n| writer9         = [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel Kilcher]] & [[Ralph Sall]]\n| length9         = 4:58\n| title10         = Warning\n| extra10         = [[All Too Much]]\n| writer10        = [[Tim DeLaughter]] & Ralph Sall\n| length10        = 4:44\n| title11         = Spastica\n| extra11         = [[Elastica]]\n| writer11        = [[Justine Frischmann]]\n| length11        = 2:31\n| title12         = The Horror\n| extra12         = [[Spacehog]]\n| writer12        = [[Bryce Goggin]]\n| length12        = 4:49\n| title13         = Bells, Books and Candles \n| extra13         = [[Graeme Revell]]\n| writer13        = Graeme Revell\n| length13        = 4:47\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Reception===\n''The Craft'' received mixed reviews upon its release and currently holds a 55% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 56 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 5.48/10.

At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls considered outcasts for one reason or another and rumored to be [[Witchcraft|witches]];  Bonnie Harper (who bears burn scars from an auto accident), Nancy Downs (whose family lives in a trailer and whose stepfather is abusive) and Rochelle Zimmerman (who is African American and subjected to racist bullying from a popular group of white girls). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker. Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \"Manon\". \n\nSarah already exhibited supernatural powers, and her new friends believe that she will complete their [[coven]], making them all powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. It is also revealed that Sarah has attempted suicide in the past.\n\nAfter a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to find that he has spread a false rumor that they have had sex and she was terrible in bed. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. In response, Sarah casts a love spell upon him. In turn, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on hateful yet popular racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty and Nancy for power. It very soon becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back [[miraculously]] heal, and Rochelle's racist bully, Laura, begins to lose her hair. Nancy goes further by causing her stepfather to have a heart attack and die. This enables Nancy and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move out of the trailer park they had been living in and into a luxurious high rise apartment.\n\nNancy becomes greedy for power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit\". On completion of the spell, she is struck by lightning. Afterward, she [[psychopathy|lacks empathy]] and begins taking risks with her life and those of others.\n\nThe spells that the girls have cast soon begin to show negative consequences: Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic; Rochelle finds Laura Lizzie traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically; Chris attempts to rape Sarah when she rejects his continual advances. In supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah, attempting to fool Chris into having sex with her. She is interrupted by the real Sarah who tells Nancy to leave with her but it becomes obvious that Nancy has unrequited feelings for Chris. Upset at being fooled, Chris tells Nancy that she is jealous. Nancy then uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.  \n\nSarah performs a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but this does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, threaten her and use their powers of illusion to make Sarah believe that her father and stepmother have been killed in a plane accident. They torment her with visions of swarms of snakes, insects and rats, as well as making her believe she is responsible for Chris's and her mother's death when giving birth to her, trying to persuade her to commit suicide, before Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although she is initially terrified, Sarah successfully \"invokes the spirit\" and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by bringing their worst fears to life, and defeats Nancy, binding her power to prevent her from doing harm.\n\nBonnie and Rochelle, finding they suddenly no longer have powers, go to Sarah to try to find out why, and to attempt reconciliation with her, only to find that Sarah now wants nothing more to do with them and that \"Manon\" has taken away their powers for abusing them. Bonnie and Rochelle then turn away sniggering about Sarah not having powers anymore. Sarah turns to them and invokes lightning, which strikes a tree branch that nearly falls on Bonnie and Rochelle. Sarah then warns them to be careful, so as not to end up like Nancy; whose powers have also been taken away, and is committed to a psychiatric hospital where she babbles insanely, is strapped to a bed, and has scratches on her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Sarah Bailey\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Nancy Downs \n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Bonnie Harper \n* [[Rachel True]] as Rochelle Zimmerman\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Chris Hooker\n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Mr. Bailey\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Laura Lizzie\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Mitt\n* [[Nathaniel Marston]] as Trey\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Grace Downs\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as Lirio\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Street Preacher\n* [[Brenda Strong]] as Doctor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept for ''The Craft'' came from a collaboration between producer [[Douglas Wick]], who wanted to create a film about the high school experience blended with witchcraft, and screenwriter Peter Filardi, who extensively researched the topic and wrote the initial draft.<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Andrew Fleming]] was hired to direct and produce the final version of the screenplay.\n\nEighty-five different actresses screen-tested for the four main roles, including [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Rachel True]] and [[Fairuza Balk]] were the first to be cast in their respective roles. The character of Rochelle was re-written when True was cast to be biracial, incorporating racism [[subplot]] as the character's major conflict. [[Robin Tunney]] was initially cast in the role of Bonnie, but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah, which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former. [[Neve Campbell]], the most well-known of the four actresses for her role on ''[[Party of Five]]'', was then cast as Bonnie. Tunney had shaved her head for her role in ''[[Empire Records]]'' and had to wear a wig throughout filming.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nProduction enlisted a real-life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as on-set advisor for the film. She wrote the incantations used and ensured that the treatment of the [[Wiccan]] subject-matter was as accurate and respectful as possible.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nShooting took place throughout Los Angeles, including the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], [[Sunset Boulevard]], and [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]].  [[Verdugo Hills High School]] was the setting for the fictional Catholic school, St. Benedict's Academy; production designer Marek Dobrowolski added various religious statues throughout the building and the grounds. Sarah's home in the film was a two-story Spanish mansion and the interiors were built on a sound stage at Culver City Studios. The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles, stigmas, religious statues, masks and tribal dolls were added for effect. Jensen's Recreation Center in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations. During filming, an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured; the production's medic saw this and called paramedics. The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch, a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find.  Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like [[Griffith Park]]. The beach summoning took place at [[Leo Carrillo State Park]], which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/revisiting-the-la-filming-locations-of-the-craft-20-years-later-6870417|title=Revisiting the L.A.

His painting style can be described as a well-balanced mix of colors dominated by the use of yellow ochre. The human figures he paints tend to be broad-shouldered and have elongated bodies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some historic events that he participated in during his career include the crayon drawings commission for [[Ronald Berndt]] after he arrived in Yirrkala in 1946, the Yirrkala Church Panels of 1963, and the Yirrkala Bark Petitions of 1963. \n\nAside from ancestral stories, he also produced several paintings depicting the interaction of Yolngu with the [[Makassar|Makassan]] people, who were seafarers that seasonally visited the northern Arnhem Land coast to harvest trepang, or sea cucumbers<ref name=\":1\" />. It is suspected that Munggurrawuy was quite young when he last interacted with Makassans, since the Australian Government banned other countries from using the resources found on Australian coasts in 1906. However, he did remember meeting Makassan people and for Berndt\u2019s crayon drawing commission, he drew his famous Port of Macassar.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn the late 1960s, Munggurrawuy was commissioned to produce a series of painting on masonite board to commemorate events involving the [[European Launcher Development Organisation|ELDO]] tracking station at Gurlkurla by by Geoff Woods, who was employed as the base manager at a nearby weapons research centre. One work of these works, ''Space Tracking Station'' (1967), was subsequently acquired by the [[South Australian Museum]] and included in the exhibition ''Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia'' at the Asia Society Galleries in New York City in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17766382|title=Dreamings : the art of aboriginal Australia|others=Sutton, Peter, 1946-, Asia Society.

Furious at the lack of transparency the Australian government held for the Yolngu people, clan elders came together to paint the famous Yirrkala Church Panels, which documented the Yolngu claim to the land through ancestral stories. Consisting of two four meter tall sheets of masonite, eight elders of the ''Dhuwa'' moiety painted one sheet with their cultural totems and creation stories and eight elders of the ''Yirritja'' moiety, including Munggurrawuy Yunupingu, painted the other sheet with theirs. This was the first significant political claim to the land by Aboriginal people, accompanied by physical documentation in the form of the church panel paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> This would also lead to the creation of the Yirrkala Bark Petitions of 1963.\n\n== Collections ==\n\n* [[Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection]] of the [[University of Virginia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kluge-ruhe.org/collections/|title=Collections|website=Kluge-Ruhe|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n*[[National Museum of Australia]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://collectionsearch.nma.gov.au/set/2716|title=MUNGURRAWUY YUNUPINGU|website=National Museum of Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Significant Exhibitions ==\n\n* 1965: ''Australian Aboriginal Bark Paintings 1912-1964.''

He is known to be one of the artists who spearheaded the \u201cepisodic\u201d manner of painting, where stories are painted in a series of panels to show how they unfold over time.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.crikey.com.au/northern/2013/07/11/the-yirrkala-church-panels-the-title-deeds-for-yolngu-clan-estates/|title=The Yirrkala Church Panels, the title deeds for Yolngu clan estates \u2013 The Northern Myth|website=blogs.crikey.com.au|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> While he painted traditional stories and concepts, his innovation greatly diverged from common single-paneled narrative paintings. His painting style can be described as a well-balanced mix of colors dominated by the use of yellow ochre. The human figures he paints tend to be broad-shouldered and have elongated bodies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some historic events that he participated in during his career include the crayon drawings commission for [[Ronald Berndt]] after he arrived in Yirrkala in 1946, the Yirrkala Church Panels of 1963, and the Yirrkala Bark Petitions of 1963. \n\nAside from ancestral stories, he also produced several paintings depicting the interaction of Yolngu with the [[Makassar|Makassan]] people, who were seafarers that seasonally visited the northern Arnhem Land coast to harvest trepang, or sea cucumbers<ref name=\":1\" />. It is suspected that Munggurrawuy was quite young when he last interacted with Makassans, since the Australian Government banned other countries from using the resources found on Australian coasts in 1906. However, he did remember meeting Makassan people and for Berndt\u2019s crayon drawing commission, he drew his famous Port of Macassar.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn the late 1960s, Munggurrawuy was commissioned to produce a series of painting on masonite board to commemorate events involving the [[European Launcher Development Organisation|ELDO]] tracking station at Gurlkurla by by Geoff Woods, who was employed as the base manager at a nearby weapons research centre. One work of these works, ''Space Tracking Station'' (1967), was subsequently acquired by the [[South Australian Museum]] and included in the exhibition ''Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia'' at the Asia Society Galleries in New York City in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17766382|title=Dreamings : the art of aboriginal Australia|others=Sutton, Peter, 1946-, Asia Society.

Furious at the lack of transparency the Australian government held for the Yolngu people painted the famous Yirrkala Church Panels, which documented the Yolngu claim to the land through ancestral stories. Consisting of two four meter tall sheets of masonite, eight elders of the ''Dhuwa'' moiety painted one sheet with their cultural totems and creation stories and eight elders of the ''Yirritja'' moiety, including Munggurrawuy Yunupingu, painted the other sheet with theirs. This was the first significant political claim to the land by Aboriginal people, accompanied by physical documentation in the form of the church panel paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> This would also lead to the creation of the Yirrkala Bark Petitions of 1963.\n\n== Collections ==\n\n* [[Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection]] of the [[University of Virginia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kluge-ruhe.org/collections/|title=Collections|website=Kluge-Ruhe|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n*[[National Museum of Australia]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://collectionsearch.nma.gov.au/set/2716|title=MUNGURRAWUY YUNUPINGU|website=National Museum of Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Significant Exhibitions ==\n\n* 1965: ''Australian Aboriginal Bark Paintings 1912-1964.''

The highway, originally known as the Anchorage-Fairbanks Highway, was completed in 1971, and given its current name in 1975.\n[[File:ParksHighwayatHurricane.jpg|thumb|left|The Parks Highway near [[Hurricane, Alaska|Hurricane]]]]\nThe highway, which mostly parallels the [[Alaska Railroad]], is one of the most important roads in Alaska. It is the main route between Anchorage and Fairbanks (Alaska's two [[Alaska census statistical areas|largest metropolitan areas]]), the principal access to [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] and [[Denali State Park]], and the main highway in the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]]. The route's Interstate designation is not signed; rather, its entire length is signed as Alaska Route 3.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the name \"Parks Highway\" comes from the road's proximity to the [[Denali]] state and national parks; it is in fact in honor of [[George Alexander Parks]], [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory|Territory of Alaska]] from 1925 to 1933.<ref>{{cite news |title=Parks Highway |page=4 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=July 16, 1975 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oD8dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=16YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5027,1440414 }}</ref> However, the aptness of the name was recognized when it was chosen.\n\nMileposts along the Parks Highway do not begin with 0 (zero).

The [[Zero mile marker|0 (zero) mile marker]] for the [[Glenn Highway]] is at its terminus in downtown [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] at the intersection of East 5th Avenue and Gambell Street.

The route's Interstate designation is not signed; rather, its entire length is signed as Alaska Route 3.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the name \"Parks Highway\" comes from the road's proximity to the [[Denali]] state and national parks; it is in fact in honor of [[George Alexander Parks]], [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory|Territory of Alaska]] from 1925 to 1933.<ref>{{cite news |title=Parks Highway |page=4 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=July 16, 1975 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oD8dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=16YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5027,1440414 }}</ref> However, the aptness of the name was recognized when it was chosen.\n\nMileposts along the Parks Highway do not begin with 0 (zero).

She announced her resignation on the morning of 22 November 1990, ending more than 15 years as Conservative leader and 11 years as Prime Minister.\n\n==Background to the contest==\n{{See also|Third Thatcher ministry}}\nDiscontent with Thatcher's leadership of the party had been growing over the latter years of her tenure. There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the [[European Union|European Economic Community]]. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] and Chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]] forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] (in theory a promotion but in reality removing him from a key post).\n\nWhereas Thatcher had presided over an economic boom at the time of her [[1987 United Kingdom general election|third general election victory in 1987]], by the autumn of 1989 interest rates had to be raised to 15% to cool inflation, which was now pushing 10%. Rates would remain at that level until October 1990. Lawson, who had clashed with Thatcher over \"shadowing the Deutschmark\" early in 1988, resigned as Chancellor in October 1989, unable to accept Thatcher publicly taking independent advice from the economist [[Alan Walters]]. The beneficiary was [[John Major]], little known to the public hitherto, who had briefly been promoted to succeed Howe as Foreign Secretary in July before succeeding Lawson as Chancellor in October, putting him in pole position to succeed Thatcher.\n\nIn December 1989, Thatcher was [[1989 Conservative Party leadership election|challenged for the leadership]] for the first time since [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|her election to that position]] in 1975, by the little known 69-year-old [[backbench]] MP Sir [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Meyer]]. Thatcher faced no serious threat of losing to this [[stalking horse]] challenger, but her political credibility was undermined by the fact that 60 members of the parliamentary Conservative party had not supported her, 33 voting for Meyer, 24 spoiling their ballot papers, and three not voting at all. The non-voters were reported by the next day's ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' to include Michael Heseltine, with the same newspaper ominously reporting that Heseltine's supporters predicted that unless the Prime Minister changed \"her style of leadership\", she would \"be on her way out next year\".<ref name=\"GH6Dec1989\">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Bruising Win for Thatcher |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19891206&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=17 January 2020 |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 December 1989 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 1990, the popularity both of Thatcher and her Conservative government waned considerably. The introduction of the deeply unpopular [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (which opponents labelled the \"poll tax\") had been greeted with widespread non-payment and even a [[Poll Tax Riots|riot in Trafalgar Square]] in March 1990. Labour had held a lead in most of the opinion polls since mid-1989, and at the height of the poll tax controversy, at least one opinion poll had shown Labour support above 50%, a lead of more than 20 points over the Conservatives, although the Conservative parliamentary majority still stood at nearly 100 seats.\n\nBy this time European leaders were discussing merging Europe's currencies to form a [[European Monetary Union|single currency]], a move which Thatcher also did not favour, and in June Major suggested that this should be a \"hard [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]\", competing for use against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and the Foreign Secretary, [[Douglas Hurd]], finally obtained agreement from a reluctant Thatcher that Britain should join the ERM. By late 1990 the economy was in the first stages of [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], leading to inevitable concerns among Conservative MPs that their party might not win the next election, due by summer 1992 at the latest.\n\n==Howe's resignation triggers contest==\nIn her Party Conference Speech early in October, Thatcher mocked the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' new \"bird\" logo in language lifted from the famous [[Monty Python]] \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Only days later,  the Liberal Democrats took a seat from the Conservatives at the [[1990 Eastbourne by-election|Eastbourne by-election]].{{sfn|Harris|2014|p=314}} On 31 October, Thatcher spoke out firmly in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] against the vision of European integration, including a [[Single European currency|single currency]], espoused by the [[European Commission]] under [[Jacques Delors]] at the recent Rome Summit, characterising it as the path to a federal Europe, and declared that her response to such a vision would be \"No! No! No!\" This led to the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] on 1 November. However, Howe did not make his resignation speech immediately, because he had temporarily lost his voice.\n\nThe pro-European former Cabinet minister [[Michael Heseltine]] had resigned from the Cabinet over the [[Westland affair]] in January 1986 and had been conducting himself as a Prime Minister in waiting, critical of Thatcher's leadership, ever since. He now wrote a six-page public letter to his local Association chairman, calling for more regard for the wide range of opinions in the party before leaving for a trip to the Middle East. His Association officers sent him a 97-word reply on 5 November saying that they supported Thatcher's leadership. The party's regional agent had been present at their meeting, although they insisted he had not interfered with their reply. At about the same time, Thatcher's press secretary [[Bernard Ingham]] briefed journalists that Heseltine had \"lit the blue touch paper then retired\", although he denied having demanded that Heseltine \"put up{{refn|In other words, to stand against Thatcher for the leadership.}} or shut up\"; Heseltine was also taunted along similar lines by the pro-Conservative press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. Thatcher brought the annual leadership election forward by a fortnight.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=338\u201342}}\n\nAt the Lord Mayor's Banquet on 12 November,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108241 |title=Speech at Lord Mayor's Banquet |date=12 November 1990 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Thatcher dismissed Howe's resignation by employing a cricketing metaphor:\n\n{{blockquote|I am still at the crease, though the bowling has been pretty hostile of late.

That is my style.}}\n\nThe next day, 13 November, Howe made his resignation speech from the backbenches,<ref>{{cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1990/nov/13/personal-statement |title=Personal Statement |date=13 November 1990 |volume=180 |column_start=461 |column_end=465}}</ref> addressing his dismay at Thatcher's approach and responding to her recent cricketing metaphor by employing one of his own. Explaining how, in his opinion, her approach made it hard for British ministers to negotiate for Britain's interests in Europe, he declared:\n\n{{blockquote|It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find, the moment the first balls are bowled, that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.}}\n\nHowe's dramatic speech received cheers from the opposition benches and reinforced the change in general perception of Thatcher from the \"Iron Lady\" to a divisive and confrontational figure. The next morning, 14 November, Heseltine announced that he would challenge her for the leadership of the party.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=344\u20135}}\n\n==Contest rules==\nThe rules for Conservative leadership contests had been introduced for the first such election,  [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|in 1965]], and modified [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|in 1975]], the occasion of Thatcher's own victory over the incumbent leader [[Edward Heath]]. There would be a series of ballots of Conservative MPs, conducted by the [[1922 Committee]], with that committee's chairman, [[Cranley Onslow]], as Returning Officer.\n\nTo win in the first round, as Thatcher had done one year before, a candidate needed not just to win an absolute majority, but also to have a lead over the runner-up of 15 per cent of the total electorate (not just those who actually voted, as had been the case until the 1975 review, but including those who abstained or spoiled their ballot papers). As there were 372 Conservative MPs in November 1990, a majority of at least 56 votes was therefore required.\n\nIf no candidate achieved a sufficient majority, nominations would be re-opened, so new candidates could come forward, and a second ballot would take place one week later, at which only an absolute majority would be required. If necessary, the top three candidates from the second round would then go forward to a third and final round held under the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] system.\n\nMany speculated that, if Thatcher did not achieve outright victory in the first round, she would either be forced to step down (opening up the field to her supporters who had previously been prevented from standing by their personal loyalty) or else might suffer further challenges from heavyweight figures. Although Heseltine was a serious leadership contender in his own right, many saw him (correctly, as it turned out) as a \"[[stalking horse]]\" like Meyer in 1989, who might weaken Thatcher only to pave the way for victory by a new candidate in a later round.\n\n==First ballot==\nHeseltine was proposed by [[Neil Macfarlane (politician)|Neil Macfarlane]] (who had been a leading Thatcher backer in the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975 contest]]) and [[Peter Tapsell (British politician)|Peter Tapsell]]. His campaign was run by [[Keith Hampson]], [[Michael Mates]] and [[Peter Temple-Morris]]. He proposed a complete review of the poll tax but rejected Thatcher's proposal of a referendum on British membership of the mooted single European currency. Thatcher gave an interview to ''[[The Times]]'' in which she attacked his [[corporatism|corporatist]] views, which made her appear extreme. Heseltine canvassed hard around Parliament whilst Thatcher was away at the [[Paris Charter|Fontainebleau summit]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=346\u20138}}\n\nThe first ballot in the election took place on Tuesday 20 November 1990. Thatcher herself was still in France on the night of the contest and therefore voted by proxy, perhaps anticipating a better result than she actually achieved.\n<!-- this section is transcluded on Electoral history of Margaret Thatcher -->:\n<section begin=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|First ballot: 20 November 1990\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/20/newsid_4318000/4318718.stm |work=On This Day |title=1990: Thatcher fails to win party mandate |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref>\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Margaret Thatcher]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 204\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 54.8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Michael Heseltine]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 152\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 40.9\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | Abstentions\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4.3\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 52\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Turnout\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 372\n| align=\"right\" | ''N/A''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|Second ballot required\n|}<section end=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n\nAlthough Thatcher had obtained a clear majority, she was four votes short of the required 15% margin, so the contest had to move to a second ballot. Thatcher gave a short statement in Paris following the announcement of the result, declaring that she intended to contest the second ballot, and on her return to London the following morning declared \"I fight on; I fight to win\".\n\nAfter the first ballot result the Heseltine team boasted of momentum, which was tactically foolish in the view of his biographer [[Michael Crick]]. He argues that they should have encouraged Thatcher to remain in the contest by underplaying Heseltine's support, much as the then challenger Thatcher and her campaign manager [[Airey Neave]] had done prior to the first ballot of the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975 contest]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=349\u201352}}\n\nHurd and Major pledged their support for Thatcher, as did [[Cecil Parkinson]], [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] and ex-Cabinet minister [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]]. [[Norman Tebbit]], another ex-Cabinet minister, was part of her campaign team, along with [[John Wakeham]]. Thatcher's campaign manager, [[Peter Morrison]], advised her to consult Cabinet members one by one on 21 November. Cabinet ministers had decided before consulting Thatcher the line they would each take: though they would support her in the second ballot, they thought that she would lose. [[Peter Lilley]], [[William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill|William Waldegrave]], [[John Gummer]] and [[Chris Patten]] stuck to this line. [[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Secretary of State for Education]], became the first of her ministers to advise her that she could not win but that he could support her as Prime Minister for another five or ten years. [[Malcolm Rifkind]] said she would not win and was unsure whether he could support her in the second ballot. [[Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville|Peter Brooke]] said he would support Thatcher whatever she chose to do and that she could win \"with all guns blazing\". [[Michael Howard]] doubted whether she could win but said he would campaign vigorously for her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109189 |title=Falling from power: Cabinet overboard [memoirs extract] |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=22 November 1990 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThatcher therefore decided to withdraw her candidacy on the morning of 22 November 1990 (she remained in office as Prime Minister until the contest had been concluded). As a result of this, two further candidates allowed themselves to be nominated: the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]], and the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[John Major]].\n\n==Second ballot==\nThe Cabinet agreed that if Heseltine became party leader, it would divide the party even further; and that one of its present members should succeed Thatcher. The only Cabinet member to endorse Heseltine for the second ballot was the [[Secretary of State for Wales|Welsh Secretary]], [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|David Hunt]], who had not been party to the agreement as he had been away in Tokyo. Four junior ministers openly backed Heseltine: the [[Welsh Office]] ministers [[Wyn Roberts, Baron Roberts of Conwy|Wyn Roberts]] and [[Ian Grist]], and [[David Trippier]] and David Leigh. Heseltine was also endorsed by a number of senior ex-ministers including: [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], [[Nigel Lawson]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (who as a peer had no vote), [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], [[David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford|David Howell]], [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]], [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Norman Fowler]], [[Geoffrey Rippon]], [[Jim Prior]], [[Norman St John-Stevas]] and [[Paul Channon]], but he had less support among younger MPs amongst whom he had done little to canvass support. Heseltine's campaign chairman [[Michael Mates]] was away for five days in the Middle East with the Defence Select Committee, of which he was chairman, so Heseltine's campaign did not have the cohesion of Major's, which was run by [[Norman Lamont]]. Heseltine's supporters, besides being older than those of the other candidates, tended to be pro-Europeans with a few populist backbenchers like [[David Evans (British politician)|David Evans]], [[Tony Marlow]] and [[John Wilkinson (British politician)|John Wilkinson]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=353\u20138}}\n\nHeseltine, a self-made multi-millionaire, was photographed at his country mansion [[Thenford House]], Northamptonshire, which played poorly when set aside the stress which Major placed on his humble origins in [[Brixton]]. Major was soon seen as having the potential to lead the Conservatives to another consecutive general election victory; especially after he matched Heseltine's pledge to review the poll tax. Although ordinary members did not then have a vote in party leadership elections, they made their views known: 485 local Conservative Associations backed Major, whilst only 65 backed Heseltine and 22 backed Hurd. Several MPs who backed Heseltine later faced attempts to deselect them as candidates. Thatcher lobbied hard, urging MPs who supported her to vote for Major.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=353\u20138}} Around a third of the Conservative Parliamentary Party were the \"payroll vote\", ministers and [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|PPS]]s, who could normally be expected to support the \"official\" line in votes.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=349\u201352}}\n\nThe second round of voting took place on Tuesday 27 November 1990.\n<!-- this section is transcluded on Electoral history of John Major -->:\n<section begin=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|Second ballot: 27 November 1990\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[John Major]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 185\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 49.7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Michael Heseltine]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 131\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 35.2\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Douglas Hurd]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 56\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 15.1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 54\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.5\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Turnout\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 372\n| align=\"right\" | ''N/A''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|Third ballot required\n|}<section end=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n\nMajor, seen as relatively new blood in the government, secured a commanding lead (although with fewer votes than Thatcher had obtained in the first ballot) of 185 votes to [[Michael Heseltine]]'s 131 votes and [[Douglas Hurd]]'s 56.\n\nResearchers later found that around 20 MPs had voted for Thatcher in the first ballot then for Heseltine in the second. However, around 30 of Heseltine's first ballot supporters, including [[Jerry Hayes]] and [[David Mellor]], had switched to Major, and about 10, including [[Steven Norris]], had switched to Hurd, for a net loss of 21 votes.{{sfn|Crick|1997|p=358}}\n\nMajor was two votes short of an overall majority, requiring a third round to be held on 29 November 1990. However, within minutes of the result, Heseltine and Hurd withdrew from the contest in Major's favour. It was therefore announced by the Chairman of the [[1922 Committee]], [[Cranley Onslow]], that no third round would be necessary, and that Major was elected unopposed.\n\n==Reaction==\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', a firm supporter of Thatcher and her party since her [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election campaign in 1979]], marked her resignation with the front-page headline \"MRS T-EARS\" on 23 November 1990, in reference to her breaking down in tears in front of her ministers after announcing her resignation.

Following Thatcher's formal resignation as Prime Minister, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] invited Major to form a government the next day. [[Douglas Hurd]] was re-appointed as Foreign Secretary and [[Michael Heseltine]] returned to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]], a post he had held in the early 1980s. Both Hurd and Heseltine remained key figures during the Major government, Heseltine eventually rising to become Deputy Prime Minister in 1995.\n\nMajor's premiership began well, and he was credited with restoring a consensual style of Cabinet government after the years of forceful leadership under Thatcher. The success of the [[First Gulf War]] in early 1991 contributed to strong public support.  He secured some foreign policy successes in Europe, negotiating the [[Maastricht Treaty]] after securing an opt-out from the [[Social Chapter]] and the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|single currency]], and he sprung a surprise victory in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]], securing a majority of 21 seats.\n\nNevertheless, the political tides soon turned. The government's reputation for economic competence was destroyed by [[Black Wednesday|Britain's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism]] in September 1992. A notable protest came from Thatcher's former cabinet minister [[Norman Tebbit]] at the 1992 Party Conference, that the Conservatives had been wrong to ignore Thatcher's wishes to stay out (whether Britain entered the ERM at too high an exchange rate has been debated ever since). Apart from a brief period during the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] in 2000, the Conservatives would not again enjoy an opinion poll lead until after the election of [[David Cameron]] as leader in 2005. The [[Maastricht Rebels|ongoing rebellion]] in the first half of 1993 by Conservative backbenchers against the passage of the Maastricht Treaty through the House of Commons was also deeply damaging to the government.  Many of the Maastricht rebels were Thatcher supporters, and one of them, [[Teresa Gorman]], devoted the opening chapter of her memoir of the incident to an account of the 1990 leadership contest.\n\nThe massive [[1997 United Kingdom general election|Conservative defeat in 1997]] at the hands of [[Tony Blair]] and [[New Labour]] was thus attributable, at least in part, to the perception of internal division over Europe which had first been exposed by the 1990 leadership election. The Conservatives would not achieve the most seats in another general election until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], under [[David Cameron]], and even then they fell short of an overall majority and had to form a government in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. They would win a small 12-seat majority in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], only to lose it again at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] but would win in a landslide in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe leadership contest was the subject of the 1991 TV movie ''[[Thatcher: The Final Days]]''.<ref>{{cite

1990 following the decision of [[Michael Heseltine]], former [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence]] and [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]], to challenge [[Margaret Thatcher]], the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|incumbent Prime Minister]], for leadership of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThatcher failed to win outright under the terms of the election in the first ballot, and was persuaded to withdraw from the second round of voting. She announced her resignation on the morning of 22 November 1990, ending more than 15 years as Conservative leader and 11 years as Prime Minister.\n\n==Background to the contest==\n{{See also|Third Thatcher ministry}}\nDiscontent with Thatcher's leadership of the party had been growing over the latter years of her tenure. There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the [[European Union|European Economic Community]]. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] and Chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]] forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] (in theory a promotion but in reality removing him from a key post).\n\nWhereas Thatcher had presided over an economic boom at the time of her [[1987 United Kingdom general election|third general election victory in 1987]], by the autumn of 1989 interest rates had to be raised to 15% to cool inflation, which was now pushing 10%. Rates would remain at that level until October 1990. Lawson, who had clashed with Thatcher over \"shadowing the Deutschmark\" early in 1988, resigned as Chancellor in October 1989, unable to accept Thatcher publicly taking independent advice from the economist [[Alan Walters]]. The beneficiary was [[John Major]], little known to the public hitherto, who had briefly been promoted to succeed Howe as Foreign Secretary in July before succeeding Lawson as Chancellor in October, putting him in pole position to succeed Thatcher.\n\nIn December 1989, Thatcher was [[1989 Conservative Party leadership election|challenged for the leadership]] for the first time since [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|her election to that position]] in 1975, by the little known 69-year-old [[backbench]] MP Sir [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Meyer]]. Thatcher faced no serious threat of losing to this [[stalking horse]] challenger, but her political credibility was undermined by the fact that 60 members of the parliamentary Conservative party had not supported her, 33 voting for Meyer, 24 spoiling their ballot papers, and three not voting at all. The non-voters were reported by the next day's ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' to include Michael Heseltine, with the same newspaper ominously reporting that Heseltine's supporters predicted that unless the Prime Minister changed \"her style of leadership\", she would \"be on her way out next year\".<ref name=\"GH6Dec1989\">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Bruising Win for Thatcher |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19891206&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=17 January 2020 |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 December 1989 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 1990, the popularity both of Thatcher and her Conservative government waned considerably. The introduction of the deeply unpopular [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (which opponents labelled the \"poll tax\") had been greeted with widespread non-payment and even a [[Poll Tax Riots|riot in Trafalgar Square]] in March 1990. Labour had held a lead in most of the opinion polls since mid-1989, and at the height of the poll tax controversy, at least one opinion poll had shown Labour support above 50%, a lead of more than 20 points over the Conservatives, although the Conservative parliamentary majority still stood at nearly 100 seats.\n\nBy this time European leaders were discussing merging Europe's currencies to form a [[European Monetary Union|single currency]], a move which Thatcher also did not favour, and in June Major suggested that this should be a \"hard [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]\", competing for use against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and the Foreign Secretary, [[Douglas Hurd]], finally obtained agreement from a reluctant Thatcher that Britain should join the ERM. By late 1990 the economy was in the first stages of [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], leading to inevitable concerns among Conservative MPs that their party might not win the next election, due by summer 1992 at the latest.\n\n==Howe's resignation triggers contest==\nIn her Party Conference Speech early in October, Thatcher mocked the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' new \"bird\" logo in language lifted from the famous [[Monty Python]] \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Only days later,  the Liberal Democrats took a seat from the Conservatives at the [[1990 Eastbourne by-election|Eastbourne by-election]].{{sfn|Harris|2014|p=314}} On 31 October, Thatcher spoke out firmly in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] against the vision of European integration, including a [[Single European currency|single currency]], espoused by the [[European Commission]] under [[Jacques Delors]] at the recent Rome Summit, characterising it as the path to a federal Europe, and declared that her response to such a vision would be \"No! No! No!\" This led to the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] on 1 November. However, Howe did not make his resignation speech immediately, because he had temporarily lost his voice.\n\nThe pro-European former Cabinet minister [[Michael Heseltine]] had resigned from the Cabinet over the [[Westland affair]] in January 1986 and had been conducting himself as a Prime Minister in waiting, critical of Thatcher's leadership, ever since. He now wrote a six-page public letter to his local Association chairman, calling for more regard for the wide range of opinions in the party before leaving for a trip to the Middle East. His Association officers sent him a 97-word reply on 5 November saying that they supported Thatcher's leadership. The party's regional agent had been present at their meeting, although they insisted he had not interfered with their reply. At about the same time, Thatcher's press secretary [[Bernard Ingham]] briefed journalists that Heseltine had \"lit the blue touch paper then retired\", although he denied having demanded that Heseltine \"put up{{refn|In other words, to stand against Thatcher for the leadership.}} or shut up\"; Heseltine was also taunted along similar lines by the pro-Conservative press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. Thatcher brought the annual leadership election forward by a fortnight.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=338\u201342}}\n\nAt the Lord Mayor's Banquet on 12 November,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108241 |title=Speech at Lord Mayor's Banquet |date=12 November 1990 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Thatcher dismissed Howe's resignation by employing a cricketing metaphor:\n\n{{blockquote|I am still at the crease, though the bowling has been pretty hostile of late. And in case anyone doubted it, can I assure you there will be no ducking the bouncers, no stonewalling, no playing for time. The bowling's going to get hit all round the ground. That is my style.}}\n\nThe next day, 13 November, Howe made his resignation speech from the backbenches,<ref>{{cite Hansard |house=House of Commons |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1990/nov/13/personal-statement |title=Personal Statement |date=13 November 1990 |volume=180 |column_start=461 |column_end=465}}</ref> addressing his dismay at Thatcher's approach and responding to her recent cricketing metaphor by employing one of his own. Explaining how, in his opinion, her approach made it hard for British ministers to negotiate for Britain's interests in Europe, he declared:\n\n{{blockquote|It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find, the moment the first balls are bowled, that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.}}\n\nHowe's dramatic speech received cheers from the opposition benches and reinforced the change in general perception of Thatcher from the \"Iron Lady\" to a divisive and confrontational figure. The next morning, 14 November, Heseltine announced that he would challenge her for the leadership of the party.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=344\u20135}}\n\n==Contest rules==\nThe rules for Conservative leadership contests had been introduced for the first such election,  [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election|in 1965]], and modified [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|in 1975]], the occasion of Thatcher's own victory over the incumbent leader [[Edward Heath]]. There would be a series of ballots of Conservative MPs, conducted by the [[1922 Committee]], with that committee's chairman, [[Cranley Onslow]], as Returning Officer.\n\nTo win in the first round, as Thatcher had done one year before, a candidate needed not just to win an absolute majority, but also to have a lead over the runner-up of 15 per cent of the total electorate (not just those who actually voted, as had been the case until the 1975 review, but including those who abstained or spoiled their ballot papers). As there were 372 Conservative MPs in November 1990, a majority of at least 56 votes was therefore required.\n\nIf no candidate achieved a sufficient majority, nominations would be re-opened, so new candidates could come forward, and a second ballot would take place one week later, at which only an absolute majority would be required. If necessary, the top three candidates from the second round would then go forward to a third and final round held under the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] system.\n\nMany speculated that, if Thatcher did not achieve outright victory in the first round, she would either be forced to step down (opening up the field to her supporters who had previously been prevented from standing by their personal loyalty) or else might suffer further challenges from heavyweight figures. Although Heseltine was a serious leadership contender in his own right, many saw him (correctly, as it turned out) as a \"[[stalking horse]]\" like Meyer in 1989, who might weaken Thatcher only to pave the way for victory by a new candidate in a later round.\n\n==First ballot==\nHeseltine was proposed by [[Neil Macfarlane (politician)|Neil Macfarlane]] (who had been a leading Thatcher backer in the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975 contest]]) and [[Peter Tapsell (British politician)|Peter Tapsell]]. His campaign was run by [[Keith Hampson]], [[Michael Mates]] and [[Peter Temple-Morris]]. He proposed a complete review of the poll tax but rejected Thatcher's proposal of a referendum on British membership of the mooted single European currency. Thatcher gave an interview to ''[[The Times]]'' in which she attacked his [[corporatism|corporatist]] views, which made her appear extreme. Heseltine canvassed hard around Parliament whilst Thatcher was away at the [[Paris Charter|Fontainebleau summit]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=346\u20138}}\n\nThe first ballot in the election took place on Tuesday 20 November 1990. Thatcher herself was still in France on the night of the contest and therefore voted by proxy, perhaps anticipating a better result than she actually achieved.\n<!-- this section is transcluded on Electoral history of Margaret Thatcher -->:\n<section begin=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|First ballot: 20 November 1990\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/20/newsid_4318000/4318718.stm |work=On This Day |title=1990: Thatcher fails to win party mandate |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref>\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Margaret Thatcher]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 204\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 54.8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Michael Heseltine]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 152\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 40.9\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | Abstentions\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4.3\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 52\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Turnout\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 372\n| align=\"right\" | ''N/A''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|Second ballot required\n|}<section end=\"First ballot: 20 November 1990\"/>\n\nAlthough Thatcher had obtained a clear majority, she was four votes short of the required 15% margin, so the contest had to move to a second ballot. Thatcher gave a short statement in Paris following the announcement of the result, declaring that she intended to contest the second ballot, and on her return to London the following morning declared \"I fight on; I fight to win\".\n\nAfter the first ballot result the Heseltine team boasted of momentum, which was tactically foolish in the view of his biographer [[Michael Crick]]. He argues that they should have encouraged Thatcher to remain in the contest by underplaying Heseltine's support, much as the then challenger Thatcher and her campaign manager [[Airey Neave]] had done prior to the first ballot of the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975 contest]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=349\u201352}}\n\nHurd and Major pledged their support for Thatcher, as did [[Cecil Parkinson]], [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] and ex-Cabinet minister [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]]. [[Norman Tebbit]], another ex-Cabinet minister, was part of her campaign team, along with [[John Wakeham]]. Thatcher's campaign manager, [[Peter Morrison]], advised her to consult Cabinet members one by one on 21 November. Cabinet ministers had decided before consulting Thatcher the line they would each take: though they would support her in the second ballot, they thought that she would lose. [[Peter Lilley]], [[William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill|William Waldegrave]], [[John Gummer]] and [[Chris Patten]] stuck to this line. [[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Secretary of State for Education]], became the first of her ministers to advise her that she could not win but that he could support her as Prime Minister for another five or ten years. [[Malcolm Rifkind]] said she would not win and was unsure whether he could support her in the second ballot. [[Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville|Peter Brooke]] said he would support Thatcher whatever she chose to do and that she could win \"with all guns blazing\". [[Michael Howard]] doubted whether she could win but said he would campaign vigorously for her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109189 |title=Falling from power: Cabinet overboard [memoirs extract] |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=22 November 1990 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThatcher therefore decided to withdraw her candidacy on the morning of 22 November 1990 (she remained in office as Prime Minister until the contest had been concluded). As a result of this, two further candidates allowed themselves to be nominated: the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]], and the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[John Major]].\n\n==Second ballot==\nThe Cabinet agreed that if Heseltine became party leader, it would divide the party even further; and that one of its present members should succeed Thatcher. The only Cabinet member to endorse Heseltine for the second ballot was the [[Secretary of State for Wales|Welsh Secretary]], [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|David Hunt]], who had not been party to the agreement as he had been away in Tokyo. Four junior ministers openly backed Heseltine: the [[Welsh Office]] ministers [[Wyn Roberts, Baron Roberts of Conwy|Wyn Roberts]] and [[Ian Grist]], and [[David Trippier]] and David Leigh. Heseltine was also endorsed by a number of senior ex-ministers including: [[Sir Geoffrey Howe]], [[Nigel Lawson]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (who as a peer had no vote), [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]], [[David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford|David Howell]], [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]], [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Norman Fowler]], [[Geoffrey Rippon]], [[Jim Prior]], [[Norman St John-Stevas]] and [[Paul Channon]], but he had less support among younger MPs amongst whom he had done little to canvass support. Heseltine's campaign chairman [[Michael Mates]] was away for five days in the Middle East with the Defence Select Committee, of which he was chairman, so Heseltine's campaign did not have the cohesion of Major's, which was run by [[Norman Lamont]]. Heseltine's supporters, besides being older than those of the other candidates, tended to be pro-Europeans with a few populist backbenchers like [[David Evans (British politician)|David Evans]], [[Tony Marlow]] and [[John Wilkinson (British politician)|John Wilkinson]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=353\u20138}}\n\nHeseltine, a self-made multi-millionaire, was photographed at his country mansion [[Thenford House]], Northamptonshire, which played poorly when set aside the stress which Major placed on his humble origins in [[Brixton]]. Major was soon seen as having the potential to lead the Conservatives to another consecutive general election victory; especially after he matched Heseltine's pledge to review the poll tax. Although ordinary members did not then have a vote in party leadership elections, they made their views known: 485 local Conservative Associations backed Major, whilst only 65 backed Heseltine and 22 backed Hurd. Several MPs who backed Heseltine later faced attempts to deselect them as candidates. Thatcher lobbied hard, urging MPs who supported her to vote for Major.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=353\u20138}} Around a third of the Conservative Parliamentary Party were the \"payroll vote\", ministers and [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|PPS]]s, who could normally be expected to support the \"official\" line in votes.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=349\u201352}}\n\nThe second round of voting took place on Tuesday 27 November 1990.\n<!-- this section is transcluded on Electoral history of John Major -->:\n<section begin=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|Second ballot: 27 November 1990\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[John Major]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 185\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 49.7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Michael Heseltine]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 131\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 35.2\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[Douglas Hurd]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 56\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 15.1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 54\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.5\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Turnout\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 372\n| align=\"right\" | ''N/A''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|Third ballot required\n|}<section end=\"Second ballot: 27 November 1990\"/>\n\nMajor, seen as relatively new blood in the government, secured a commanding lead (although with fewer votes than Thatcher had obtained in the first ballot) of 185 votes to [[Michael Heseltine]]'s 131 votes and [[Douglas Hurd]]'s 56.\n\nResearchers later found that around 20 MPs had voted for Thatcher in the first ballot then for Heseltine in the second. However, around 30 of Heseltine's first ballot supporters, including [[Jerry Hayes]] and [[David Mellor]], had switched to Major, and about 10, including [[Steven Norris]], had switched to Hurd, for a net loss of 21 votes.{{sfn|Crick|1997|p=358}}\n\nMajor was two votes short of an overall majority, requiring a third round to be held on 29 November 1990. However, within minutes of the result, Heseltine and Hurd withdrew from the contest in Major's favour. It was therefore announced by the Chairman of the [[1922 Committee]], [[Cranley Onslow]], that no third round would be necessary, and that Major was elected unopposed.\n\n==Reaction==\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', a firm supporter of Thatcher and her party since her [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election campaign in 1979]], marked her resignation with the front-page headline \"MRS T-EARS\" on 23 November 1990, in reference to her breaking down in tears in front of her ministers after announcing her resignation.

Following Thatcher's formal resignation as Prime Minister, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] invited Major to form a government the next day. [[Douglas Hurd]] was re-appointed as Foreign Secretary and [[Michael Heseltine]] returned to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]], a post he had held in the early 1980s. Both Hurd and Heseltine remained key figures during the Major government, Heseltine eventually rising to become Deputy Prime Minister in 1995.\n\nMajor's premiership began well, and he was credited with restoring a consensual style of Cabinet government after the years of forceful leadership under Thatcher. The success of the [[First Gulf War]] in early 1991 contributed to strong public support.  He secured some foreign policy successes in Europe, negotiating the [[Maastricht Treaty]] after securing an opt-out from the [[Social Chapter]] and the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|single currency]], and he sprung a surprise victory in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]], securing a majority of 21 seats.\n\nNevertheless, the political tides soon turned. The government's reputation for economic competence was destroyed by [[Black Wednesday|Britain's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism]] in September 1992. A notable protest came from Thatcher's former cabinet minister [[Norman Tebbit]] at the 1992 Party Conference, that the Conservatives had been wrong to ignore Thatcher's wishes to stay out (whether Britain entered the ERM at too high an exchange rate has been debated ever since). Apart from a brief period during the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] in 2000, the Conservatives would not again enjoy an opinion poll lead until after the election of [[David Cameron]] as leader in 2005. The [[Maastricht Rebels|ongoing rebellion]] in the first half of 1993 by Conservative backbenchers against the passage of the Maastricht Treaty through the House of Commons was also deeply damaging to the government.  Many of the Maastricht rebels were Thatcher supporters, and one of them, [[Teresa Gorman]], devoted the opening chapter of her memoir of the incident to an account of the 1990 leadership contest.\n\nThe massive [[1997 United Kingdom general election|Conservative defeat in 1997]] at the hands of [[Tony Blair]] and [[New Labour]] was thus attributable, at least in part, to the perception of internal division over Europe which had first been exposed by the 1990 leadership election. The Conservatives would not achieve the most seats in another general election until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], under [[David Cameron]], and even then they fell short of an overall majority and had to form a government in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. They would win a small 12-seat majority in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], only to lose it again at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] but would win in a landslide in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe leadership was the subject of the 1991 TV movie ''[[Thatcher: The Final Days]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efda0d1|title=Keith Drinkel|publisher=BFI|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin |30em |indent=yes}}\n* Some voting data taken from {{citation |last=Boothroyd |first=David |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/conleader.html |title=Conservative Party Leaders |website=election.demon.co.uk |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602070744/http://www.election.demon.co.uk/conleader.html |archive-date=2 June 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink=John Campbell (biographer) |year=2003 |title=Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady |volume=2 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-6781-4 |pages=410, 709\u201347}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Crick |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Crick |last2=Van Klaveren |first2=Adrian |authorlink2=Adrian Van Klaveren |title=Mrs Thatcher's greatest blunder |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=5 |number=3 |year=1991 |pages=397\u2013416 |quote=the poll tax}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Crick |first=Michael |title=Michael Heseltine: A Biography |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |year=1997 |isbn=0-241-13691-1}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Harris |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Harris (author) |title= Not for Turning: The Complete Life of Margaret Thatcher|publisher=Corgi |year=2014 |isbn=978-0552155793}}\n* {{cite book |last=Vinen |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Vinen |year=2009 |title=Thatcher's Britain: The Politics and Social Upheaval of the Thatcher Era |url={{Google books|IZsXpZTCQKQC|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=Simon & Schuster |publication-date=2013 |isbn=978-1-4711-2828-8 |pages=249\u201373}}\n* {{cite book |last=Watkins |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Watkins |title=A conservative coup: the fall of Margaret Thatcher |publisher=Duckworth Publishing |year=1991 |isbn=978-0715623862}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Conservative Party (UK)}}\n{{1990 Conservative Party leadership election}}\n{{Margaret Thatcher}}\n{{John Major}}\n\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) leadership elections|1990]]\n[[Category:John Major]]\n[[Category:Margaret Thatcher]]\n[[Category:1990 elections in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:November 1990 events in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "WisDom-UK", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePopular culture", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Conservative_Party_leadership_election"}
