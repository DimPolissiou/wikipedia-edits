His father was a farmer and picked [[cotton]] to help support the family that eventually included twenty-one children.  When Boyd was two years old, his father put Boyd, a brother, and his mother on a train to [[Riverside, California]].  Not having enough money to buy tickets for himself, Boyd's father was a stowaway on freight trains west to join his family.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBoyd's grandfather, William Boyd (known as \"Fiddler Bill\"), played at dances and family gatherings in Mississippi. Along with all of father's siblings, Leslie Boyd played guitar and harmonica and started  teaching Boyd to play guitar when he was nine years old. Leslie had been a farmer when a drought hit and there were no more [[agriculture|crops]], so he picked cotton. Because his father was a cotton farmer and there was no cotton in California to pick, finding work was difficult.  His father eventually got work cleaning up construction sites, and ended up becoming a finish carpenter. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBoyd's parents would take their children to [[Country and Western|country and western]] dances held in a barn in [[Colton, California]] outside of Riverside.  It was at one of these dances when Boyd's older, nine-year-old brother, Kenneth, went up to the bandstand and told the band leader, [[Texas Jim Lewis]], he should hear his little brother sing and play the guitar. Lewis called seven-year-old Boyd up to the stage to sing and play. After the dance concluded, Lewis and the manager of a local radio station approached Boyd\u2019s parents to make an offer of $50 per appearance on an hour-long radio show to be broadcast from the dance every Saturday night.\n\nWhile the family was in Los Angeles for surgery Leslie Boyd required for [[cataracts]], they were told about auditions being held for the ''[[Al Jarvis]] Talent Show'' on [[KCOP-TV|KLAC-TV]]. Following his audition, Boyd appeared on Jarvis' show the same night. Winning the contest, Boyd was the subject of numerous telegrams and telephone calls from fans addressed to Jarvis and KLAC.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJarvis, along with co-host, had a five-hour-a-day, six-day-a-week talk show on KLAC-TV called ''Hollywood On Television''. After his popular appearance and win on the talent show, Jarvis signed Boyd to appear regularly on ''Hollywood on Television'', a show he co-hosted with [[Betty White]].  With his popularity rising, Boyd started to be seen on other television shows, including CBS-TV's ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (CBS TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]''.\n\n==\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\"==\nBoyd recorded the song \"[[I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus]]\" for [[Columbia Records]] in 1952, when he was 13 years old. It became a hit, selling over two and a half million records in its first week's release and Boyd's name became known internationally.

In that era, an appearance on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s program (or even being introduced in the audience as was often the case of film stars and athletes), was considered by the entertainment industry and the public alike to be the pinnacle of success. In one of Boyd's five appearances, he replaced the scheduled popular singer of the time, [[Gisele MacKenzie]]. Boyd was in New York on his way to [[Montreal]] for a concert. After the show, Boyd was informed that MacKenzie had been bumped. He was so upset at the turn of events that he personally asked Sullivan to re-book MacKenzie (MacKenzie ultimately appeared twice on the show). In the same year and the years that followed Boyd made multiple appearances on [[Perry Como]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Hope Show]]'', the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] ''[[The Patti Page Show]]'' (1955),  [[Dave Garroway]], ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and other programs throughout the United States and [[Canada]].\n\nBoyd recorded several more hit records: teaming up with [[Frankie Laine]] in the spring of 1953 on \"[[Tell Me a Story (Terry Gilkyson song)|Tell Me a Story]]\" (written by [[Terry Gilkyson]]), which reached #4, and \"The Little Boy And The Old Man\" (#24), and with [[Rosemary Clooney]] that summer on \"Dennis the Menace,\" which reached #25.\n\n==Relationship with Mitch Miller==\nBoyd said that although he liked the songs that became hits for him, especially the duets with Frankie Laine, Rosemary Clooney, and [[Gayla Peevey]], he never wanted to sing many of the novelty songs that [[Mitch Miller]], the head of [[Artists and Repertoire]] of Columbia Records, gave him. As the head of A&R at Columbia, Mitch Miller was in charge of all the recording artists there, including Frank Sinatra. When Mitch Miller signed him to Columbia, Boyd's new roots were in [[country music]]. Boyd's first hit at Columbia under Miller, \"God's Little Candles\", was in the country field. At the time, 250,000 records was the mark of a country hit, but \"God's Little Candles\" nearly reached the million mark. Years later, [[Kris Kristofferson]] introduced himself to Boyd and told him he had borrowed the music from the bridge of \"God's Little Candles\" to write one of his songs. Boyd was a fan of Kristofferson and was so overwhelmed that when he had introduced himself, he forgot to ask Kristofferson which song he used it in. Despite this success, Miller moved Boyd into the [[pop music]] genre since country music was an isolated field at the time and very small in the overall record-buying fan base.\n\n[[Rock and roll]] was starting to change the industry, and Boyd wanted to sing rock music. Miller passionately hated rock and roll and publicly stated it was a passing fad. He forbade anyone with Columbia Records to record rock music. Although Boyd says he loved Miller like a father, he felt his era was passing; Boyd was later to be proven right.\n\nAfter a number of novelty songs that Boyd did not like and that did not reach the top ten (\"I Wanna Haircut With A Moon On Top\", \"I'll Stay In The House And Live In My Grandma's Kitchen\", \"Owl's Lullaby\", etc.), Miller called Boyd and told him that he had a new song and would be arriving in Los Angeles to play it for him. Miller set up a meeting at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] with [[Percy Faith]].  The hotel provided a room with a piano for Faith to play the song, and Miller gave Boyd the lyrics to read. After reading the first lines of the song, Boyd, without hearing the music, told Miller he did not want to sing these kind of novelty songs any more, and turned it down. Miller and Faith recorded the song with another Columbia artist named [[Jo Stafford]]. The opening lines were \"Goodbye Joe, Me gotta go, Me-O My-O. Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou.\" The song, \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]],\" went to number three on the Billboard charts. Ironically, the novelty song that Boyd declined to record had been written by country music legend [[Hank Williams]].\n\nFrank Sinatra declared that Miller's choices of songs had ruined his career, and he promptly switched over to [[Capitol Records]], where he chose his own songs and began making hit records again. However, Boyd felt a great deal of loyalty to Miller. He did not follow through with his own wish to go to Memphis and record with [[Sam Phillips]] at his [[Sun Records]], where the dawn of rock and roll was beginning with many of the new rock artists of the time. Instead, he concentrated more on movies and television, and finishing his education. In retrospect, Boyd said he wished that he had gone to Sun Records.\n\n==Other recordings==\nIn 1966 Boyd had a #3 hit in [[Brisbane, Australia]] with \"I Would Never Do That\", produced by [[Leon Russell]] and [[Snuff Garrett]] and engineered by [[J.J. Cale]] for [[Imperial Records]]. The flip side, \"Will I Cry\", was co-written, engineered, had backup vocals and guitar instrumentals by J.J. Cale. Boyd stated that it was one of his all-time fun and favorite recording sessions and that he didn't care if it didn't sell a single record. The experience with Leon and J.J. was a \"once in a lifetime high, and I don't mean drugs... necessarily\"!\n\nAnother favorite recording session of Boyd's was a song written by [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], \"That's What I'll Give to You\". [[Terry Melcher]] produced the session for Boyd on [[Vee-Jay Records]]. Vee-Jay was the first company to release all the early [[Beatles]] records in the United States. Before Boyd's single was released, Vee-Jay was sued by Capitol and lost all the royalties and rights to the Beatles. Vee-Jay Records went bankrupt. The song was recently released on [[Rhino Records]]. [[Herb Alpert]] had visited the session at Vee-Jay and liked it so much he asked Boyd and Melcher to record for his and Jerry Moss' label, [[A&M Records]]. While recording the album, the Manson murders occurred at a house in which Melcher had previously lived, prompting Melcher to abandon the project and go into seclusion. The album was never finished.\n\n[[Bobby Darin]] wrote and produced a record, ''Made In The Shade'', for Boyd. Although they had met briefly at different events, Boyd and Bobby became friends while working on different movies at [[Universal Studios]]. Unfortunately, Boyd stated, \"It was released at the same time as [[Phil Spector]]'s first amazing \"[[Wall of Sound]]\" recordings. Our record was more like a mound of sound and was lost somewhere behind the wall ... Bobby was one of the most talented people I've ever known,\" says Boyd. \"Had he lived he would have sustained the same kind of legendary career that Sinatra had ... He could do it all. He could write and sing rock and roll, folk, jazz, or croon with Sinatra. And in each genre be as good or better than the best in each field. And if that wasn't enough, he was very witty and funny. If I didn't like him so much I could've hated him for being so talented.\"\n\n==Work in film, television and Las Vegas==\nBoyd showed he had comedic talents in recurring roles in the [[television series]] ''[[Bachelor Father (US TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' (as Howard Meechum, the boyfriend of the [[Noreen Corcoran]] character), ''Date with the Angels'', ''[[The Betty White Show]]'', ''[[Broadside (TV series)|Broadside]]'' (in the role of Marion Botnik), and ''[[My Three Sons]]''. He also appeared in a number of motion pictures, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960). In that film, Boyd portrays Howard, a student who is called as the first witness in the trial of teacher Bertram Cates.\n\nOne of his surviving performances available online is with [[Betty White]] on ''[[The Betty White Show]]'' in the mid-1950s.<ref>{{YouTube|EEifjymF6K8}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Boyd was the youngest entertainer ever allowed to appear in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], starring at the famed [[Sands Hotel]]'s \"Copa Room\" at age thirteen during Sinatra's \"[[Rat Pack]]\" era. On Boyd's opening night show, he was applauded back onstage by the audience for multiple encores. With the audience still cheering and whistling, Sands boss, [[Jack Entratter]], standing backstage, caught Boyd and stopped him from going back on stage after his third encore. Entratter asked Boyd if he could please go back for only one encore during his performances, and explained that it was nearly two o'clock in the morning and that the hotel needed the people to go back to the casino and gamble. Boyd also appeared at the Golden Hotel in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Nevada]].\n\nBoyd, along with his music, did stand-up comedy. He played the theater circuit for several years that was popular at that time\u2014including The Capital, Paramount, and Seville theaters in New York City, [[Chicago]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Montreal]], and [[Toronto]]. Following entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, [[Tony Bennett]], [[Peggy Lee]], Frankie Laine, [[Johnnie Ray]] and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] with his own show, he performed at 90,000 seat-plus venues such as Soldier Field, The Rubber Bowl, The Plantation, Red Rocks and others, in Chicago, Ohio, Colorado, Hawaii and Canada, along with hundreds of one-nighters on the road throughout the U.S., Canada, and England.\n\nA seasoned performer at fourteen, he took time off to return to Hollywood to star in a horse racing movie called ''Racing Blood'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Boyd found Hollywood to be far less grueling than life on the road. At sixteen years of age he returned to Hollywood again to appear in ''The Second Greatest Sex'' with [[Jeanne Crain]], George Nader, and [[Bert Lahr]] for Universal Pictures. Then it was on to New York to do a musical version of ''Tom Sawyer'' for ''The [[United States Steel Hour]]'' on CBS, with [[Florence Henderson]] as Becky. The next year he was asked back to do the title role in ''The United States Steel Hour'''s musical version of ''Huckleberry Finn'', co-starring with [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Jack Carson]] as the carpetbaggers.\n\nNot wanting to go on the road again, and enjoying doing TV and movies, Boyd hung up his guitar at least temporarily and started having fun as a regular on comedy shows like ''Date With The Angels'', ''Bachelor Father'' with [[John Forsythe]], and ''Broadside''. He starred with [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], [[Dan Duryea]] and [[Yvette Mimieux]] in the film ''Platinum High School'' for MGM. Boyd was shooting ''Bachelor Father'' with Forsythe and simultaneously filming ''Inherit the Wind'' with Spencer Tracy, [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Fredric March]] for Universal Studios. Boyd co-starred in the national touring company of [[Neil Simon]]'s play ''[[The Star-Spangled Girl]]'' with [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Deana Martin]]. Neil Simon's brother [[Danny Simon]] stated, \"Initially Jimmy didn't want to do ''The Star-Spangled Girl''. It meant he would have to leave L.A. for a year, and he wasn't sure he wanted to do the same show night after night. Neil and I took him out to dinner and coerced him into it. Jimmy got rave reviews, and was glad he did the play.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1960, Boyd married actress [[Yvonne Craig]] (TV's ''[[Batgirl]]''). After a year of marriage, Boyd was drafted into the Army and was stationed in Texas. Separation proved unfortunate to his marriage, which ended in divorce in 1962. Boyd went to the [[Republic of Vietnam]] in 1965 with his own show for the [[United Service Organizations|USO]]. In February 1967 he also joined in [[Nancy Sinatra]]'s USO trip to entertain American troops in South Vietnam.\n\nBoyd married a second time in 1980. He and Anne Forrey Boyd had a son together, but divorced in 1984. He remained single for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"ny_times_obit\">\n\n{{cite news \n| last = Hevesi\n| first = Dennis\n| coauthors = \n| title = Jimmy Boyd, Actor and Child Singer, Dies at 70\n| work =\n| pages = \n| language = \n| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n| date = 2009-03-09\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/arts/10boyd.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\n| accessdate = 2009-03-15}}\n\n</ref>  When asked, \"What's the most exciting thing that ever happened to you?\" his reply was, \"The birth of my son.\"\n\nJimmy Boyd died of [[cancer]] in 2009 at the age of 70.<ref name =\"obit\">{{cite news | last =Nelson | first =Valerie J. | title =Jimmy Boyd dies at 70; singer of 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus' | work =Los Angeles Times | date =2009-03-09 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jimmy-boyd10-2009mar10,0,6186981.story | accessdate =2009-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nFor his contributions to the recording industry, Boyd has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the same year and the years that followed Boyd made multiple appearances on [[Perry Como]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Hope Show]]'', the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] ''[[The Patti Page Show]]'' (1955),  [[Dave Garroway]], ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and other programs throughout the United States and [[Canada]].\n\nBoyd recorded several more hit records: teaming up with [[Frankie Laine]] in the spring of 1953 on \"[[Tell Me a Story (Terry Gilkyson song)|Tell Me a Story]]\" (written by [[Terry Gilkyson]]), which reached #4, and \"The Little Boy And The Old Man\" (#24), and with [[Rosemary Clooney]] that summer on \"Dennis the Menace,\" which reached #25.\n\n==Relationship with Mitch Miller==\nBoyd said that although he liked the songs that became hits for him, especially the duets with Frankie Laine, Rosemary Clooney, and [[Gayla Peevey]], he never wanted to sing many of the novelty songs that [[Mitch Miller]], the head of [[Artists and Repertoire]] of Columbia Records, gave him. As the head of A&R at Columbia, Mitch Miller was in charge of all the recording artists there, including Frank Sinatra. When Mitch Miller signed him to Columbia, Boyd's new roots were in [[country music]]. Boyd's first hit at Columbia under Miller, \"God's Little Candles\", was in the country field. At the time, 250,000 records was the mark of a country hit, but \"God's Little Candles\" nearly reached the million mark. Years later, [[Kris Kristofferson]] introduced himself to Boyd and told him he had borrowed the music from the bridge of \"God's Little Candles\" to write one of his songs. Boyd was a fan of Kristofferson and was so overwhelmed that when he had introduced himself, he forgot to ask Kristofferson which song he used it in. Despite this success, Miller moved Boyd into the [[pop music]] genre since country music was an isolated field at the time and very small in the overall record-buying fan base.\n\n[[Rock and roll]] was starting to change the industry, and Boyd wanted to sing rock music. Miller passionately hated rock and roll and publicly stated it was a passing fad. He forbade anyone with Columbia Records to record rock music. Although Boyd says he loved Miller like a father, he felt his era was passing; Boyd was later to be proven right.\n\nAfter a number of novelty songs that Boyd did not like and that did not reach the top ten (\"I Wanna Haircut With A Moon On Top\", \"I'll Stay In The House And Live In My Grandma's Kitchen\", \"Owl's Lullaby\", etc.), Miller called Boyd and told him that he had a new song and would be arriving in Los Angeles to play it for him. Miller set up a meeting at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] with [[Percy Faith]].  The hotel provided a room with a piano for Faith to play the song, and Miller gave Boyd the lyrics to read. After reading the first lines of the song, Boyd, without hearing the music, told Miller he did not want to sing these kind of novelty songs any more, and turned it down. Miller and Faith recorded the song with another Columbia artist named [[Jo Stafford]]. The opening lines were \"Goodbye Joe, Me gotta go, Me-O My-O. Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou.\" The song, \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]],\" went to number three on the Billboard charts. Ironically, the novelty song that Boyd declined to record had been written by country music legend [[Hank Williams]].\n\nFrank Sinatra declared that Miller's choices of songs had ruined his career, and he promptly switched over to [[Capitol Records]], where he chose his own songs and began making hit records again. However, Boyd felt a great deal of loyalty to Miller. He did not follow through with his own wish to go to Memphis and record with [[Sam Phillips]] at his [[Sun Records]], where the dawn of rock and roll was beginning with many of the new rock artists of the time. Instead, he concentrated more on movies and television, and finishing his education. In retrospect, Boyd said he wished that he had gone to Sun Records.\n\n==Other recordings==\nIn 1966 Boyd had a #3 hit in [[Brisbane, Australia]] with \"I Would Never Do That\", produced by [[Leon Russell]] and [[Snuff Garrett]] and engineered by [[J.J. Cale]] for [[Imperial Records]]. The flip side, \"Will I Cry\", was co-written, engineered, had backup vocals and guitar instrumentals by J.J. Cale. Boyd stated that it was one of his all-time fun and favorite recording sessions and that he didn't care if it didn't sell a single record. The experience with Leon and J.J. was a \"once in a lifetime high, and I don't mean drugs... necessarily\"!\n\nAnother favorite recording session of Boyd's was a song written by [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], \"That's What I'll Give to You\". [[Terry Melcher]] produced the session for Boyd on [[Vee-Jay Records]]. Vee-Jay was the first company to release all the early [[Beatles]] records in the United States. Before Boyd's single was released, Vee-Jay was sued by Capitol and lost all the royalties and rights to the Beatles. Vee-Jay Records went bankrupt. The song was recently released on [[Rhino Records]]. [[Herb Alpert]] had visited the session at Vee-Jay and liked it so much he asked Boyd and Melcher to record for his and Jerry Moss' label, [[A&M Records]]. While recording the album, the Manson murders occurred at a house in which Melcher had previously lived, prompting Melcher to abandon the project and go into seclusion. The album was never finished.\n\n[[Bobby Darin]] wrote and produced a record, ''Made In The Shade'', for Boyd. Although they had met briefly at different events, Boyd and Bobby became friends while working on different movies at [[Universal Studios]]. Unfortunately, Boyd stated, \"It was released at the same time as [[Phil Spector]]'s first amazing \"[[Wall of Sound]]\" recordings. Our record was more like a mound of sound and was lost somewhere behind the wall ... Bobby was one of the most talented people I've ever known,\" says Boyd. \"Had he lived he would have sustained the same kind of legendary career that Sinatra had ... He could do it all. He could write and sing rock and roll, folk, jazz, or croon with Sinatra. And in each genre be as good or better than the best in each field. And if that wasn't enough, he was very witty and funny. If I didn't like him so much I could've hated him for being so talented.\"\n\n==Work in film, television and Las Vegas==\nBoyd showed he had comedic talents in recurring roles in the [[television series]] ''[[Bachelor Father (US TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' (as Howard Meechum, the boyfriend of the [[Noreen Corcoran]] character), ''Date with the Angels'', ''[[The Betty White Show]]'', ''[[Broadside (TV series)|Broadside]]'' (in the role of Marion Botnik), and ''[[My Three Sons]]''. He also appeared in a number of motion pictures, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960). In that film, Boyd portrays Howard, a student who is called as the first witness in the trial of teacher Bertram Cates.\n\nOne of his surviving performances available online is with [[Betty White]] on ''[[The Betty White Show]]'' in the mid-1950s.<ref>{{YouTube|EEifjymF6K8}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Boyd was the youngest entertainer ever allowed to appear in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], starring at the famed [[Sands Hotel]]'s \"Copa Room\" at age thirteen during Sinatra's \"[[Rat Pack]]\" era. On Boyd's opening night show, he was applauded back onstage by the audience for multiple encores. With the audience still cheering and whistling, Sands boss, [[Jack Entratter]], standing backstage, caught Boyd and stopped him from going back on stage after his third encore. Entratter asked Boyd if he could please go back for only one encore during his performances, and explained that it was nearly two o'clock in the morning and that the hotel needed the people to go back to the casino and gamble. Boyd also appeared at the Golden Hotel in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Nevada]].\n\nBoyd, along with his music, did stand-up comedy. He played the theater circuit for several years that was popular at that time\u2014including The Capital, Paramount, and Seville theaters in New York City, [[Chicago]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Montreal]], and [[Toronto]]. Following entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, [[Tony Bennett]], [[Peggy Lee]], Frankie Laine, [[Johnnie Ray]] and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] with his own show, he performed at 90,000 seat-plus venues such as Soldier Field, The Rubber Bowl, The Plantation, Red Rocks and others, in Chicago, Ohio, Colorado, Hawaii and Canada, along with hundreds of one-nighters on the road throughout the U.S., Canada, and England.\n\nA seasoned performer at fourteen, he took time off to return to Hollywood to star in a horse racing movie called ''Racing Blood'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Boyd found Hollywood to be far less grueling than life on the road. At sixteen years of age he returned to Hollywood again to appear in ''The Second Greatest Sex'' with [[Jeanne Crain]], George Nader, and [[Bert Lahr]] for Universal Pictures. Then it was on to New York to do a musical version of ''Tom Sawyer'' for ''The [[United States Steel Hour]]'' on CBS, with [[Florence Henderson]] as Becky. The next year he was asked back to do the title role in ''The United States Steel Hour'''s musical version of ''Huckleberry Finn'', co-starring with [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Jack Carson]] as the carpetbaggers.\n\nNot wanting to go on the road again, and enjoying doing TV and movies, Boyd hung up his guitar at least temporarily and started having fun as a regular on comedy shows like ''Date With The Angels'', ''Bachelor Father'' with [[John Forsythe]], and ''Broadside''. He starred with [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], [[Dan Duryea]] and [[Yvette Mimieux]] in the film ''Platinum High School'' for MGM. Boyd was shooting ''Bachelor Father'' with Forsythe and simultaneously filming ''Inherit the Wind'' with Spencer Tracy, [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Fredric March]] for Universal Studios. Boyd co-starred in the national touring company of [[Neil Simon]]'s play ''[[The Star-Spangled Girl]]'' with [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Deana Martin]]. Neil Simon's brother [[Danny Simon]] stated, \"Initially Jimmy didn't want to do ''The Star-Spangled Girl''. It meant he would have to leave L.A. for a year, and he wasn't sure he wanted to do the same show night after night. Neil and I took him out to dinner and coerced him into it. Jimmy got rave reviews, and was glad he did the play.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1960, Boyd married actress [[Yvonne Craig]] (TV's ''[[Batgirl]]''). After a year of marriage, Boyd was drafted into the Army and was stationed in Texas. Separation proved unfortunate to his marriage, which ended in divorce in 1962. Boyd went to the [[Republic of Vietnam]] in 1965 with his own show for the [[United Service Organizations|USO]]. In February 1967 he also joined in [[Nancy Sinatra]]'s USO trip to entertain American troops in South Vietnam.\n\nBoyd married a second time in 1980. He and Anne Forrey Boyd had a son together, but divorced in 1984. He remained single for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"ny_times_obit\">\n\n{{cite news \n| last = Hevesi\n| first = Dennis\n| coauthors = \n| title = Jimmy Boyd, Actor and Child Singer, Dies at 70\n| work =\n| pages = \n| language = \n| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n| date = 2009-03-09\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/arts/10boyd.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\n| accessdate = 2009-03-15}}\n\n</ref>  When asked, \"What's the most exciting thing that ever happened to you?\" his reply was, \"The birth of my son.\"\n\nJimmy Boyd died of [[cancer]] in 2009 at the age of 70.<ref name =\"obit\">{{cite news | last =Nelson | first =Valerie J. | title =Jimmy Boyd dies at 70; singer of 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus' | work =Los Angeles Times | date =2009-03-09 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jimmy-boyd10-2009mar10,0,6186981.story | accessdate =2009-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nFor his contributions to the recording industry, Boyd has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Stokes was from the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] and well known for his silk suits,<ref name=\"LLAP\"/> diamond rings, and flamboyant lifestyle<ref name=\"LATAP\"/> as a drug trafficking kingpin and [[pool hall]] owner.<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/> Stokes immortalized himself in Chicago by throwing a US$200,000 party on his 30th wedding anniversary in 1985 and for the decadent funeral he arranged for his murdered 28-year-old son, {{anchor|Willie \"the Wimp\" Stokes, Jr.}}Willie \"the Wimp\" Stokes, Jr. in February 1984.<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/><ref name=\"Tucker32\"/> The elder Stokes had his son buried in a Cadillac-style coffin with $100<!-- SOME SOURCES REPORT THESE AS $1,000 BILLS BUT THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INCORRECT BASED ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE JET MAGAZINE SOURCE WHICH VISUALLY CONFIRMS THAT THEY ARE IN FACT $100 BILLS. --> bills stuffed between his diamond ring-laden fingers.<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/> Two years later in November 1986, Flukey would also be murdered, along with his chauffeur, sitting inside a 1986 Cadillac limousine<ref name=\"LATReuters\"/> while talking on his wireless telephone. Stokes was 48 years old.<ref name=\"CTNDKSKIA\"/><ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\n== The Cadillac coffin ==\n\nWillie Stokes garnered international notoriety for the arrangements he made for his son Willie the Wimp's funeral.<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/> The younger Stokes followed his father's example trafficking narcotics and rivaled his dad's appetite for gambling. Flukey said of his son, \"[he was] a fine young man; he was very well liked and did a lot of gambling.\"<ref name=\"OCCT\"/> Willie the Wimp was buried in a custom-designed casket made to resemble a Cadillac Seville. At his viewing he was propped up in the coffin with his hands on the steering wheel. The casket had functioning headlights and taillights that blinked, whitewall tires, a windshield and a vanity license plate that read \"Wimp\", Stokes' nickname. He wore \"a flaming red suit, a jaunty gray hat and diamond rings. Several $100 bills stuck out from between his fingers.\"<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/><ref name=\"CTLBG\"/>\n\n== Sounds like a song ==\n\nBill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, of Austin, Texas were reading the Austin American-Statesman one morning and they read the syndicated column about Willie the Wimp. Carter said, \"I said to Ruth, 'This isn't a column\u2014it's a song'.\" They drove to the studio, and Carter said that \"in the two miles it took us to get there we put the column to music.\" [[Jimmie Vaughan]] was at the studio, and he called his brother, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], to tell him about it.<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> Stevie liked the song, recorded it, and performed it live for his fans around the world. Much of the song's lyrics came directly out of the column including a quote from Willie the Wimp's mother where she described her and her husband's reason for wanting an extravagant funeral for their son. She said that her son \"left like he lived\u2014in a lively manner.\"<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> It was worked into a verse in the song that says, \"In his Cadillac to heaven he was waving that banner; He left like he lived, in a lively manner.\"\n\n== \"Willie the Wimp\" ==\n\n[[Bill Carter (musician)|Bill Carter]] first released the song as \"Willy The Wimp (And His Cadillac Coffin)\" on his 1985 album, ''Stompin' Grounds''<ref name=\"dcdc\"/> [[Jimmie Vaughan]] played lead guitar on Carter's album, and his brother, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], released his version, titled: \"Willie the Wimp\" on his ''[[Live Alive]]'' album in July 1986.<ref name=\"ALMLA\"/> The blues-rock standard begins: \"Willie the Wimp was buried today, They laid him to rest in a special way\" which leads into a full description of the decadence that was Willie the Wimp's funeral. The song mentions \"the casketmobile, Willie the Wimp's red suit, the money between his fingers, [and] the headlights\" \u2013 into the catchy refrain, \"Talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp in his Cadillac coffin.\"<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> Stevie Ray Vaughan performed the song live in concert at the [[Midtfyns Festival]] in [[Denmark]] in 1988.\n\n== Ambush and death ==\n\nNotwithstanding the $200,000 anniversary bash Flukey arranged for his wife, nor the wedding vows they renewed on that occasion, he was with a mistress the day he was murdered. Stokes was killed by two men who lay in wait for him as he stopped to drop off his girlfriend, Diane Miller, outside her residence on 79th Street and S. Ellis Avenue. On November 19, 1986, at 12:38&nbsp;a.m., a gunman armed with a 12-gauge pump shotgun, pointed at the windshield and shot out the glass. He then proceeded to fire off more shells through the vehicle's passenger side. Stokes died from gunshot wounds in his mouth and upper chest. His driver, Ronald Johnson, was killed by a second gunman; firing a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The woman ducked the assailant's line of fire sprawling the back seat and survived the attack; uninjured.<ref name=\"LLAP\"/><ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nStokes was described, by authorities, as: \"the richest and most flamboyant drug dealer on [Chicago's] South Side\"; further stating that \"[he] was known to win or lose as much as $250,000 over a single weekend in Las Vegas\" \u2013 and that he \"seldom missed a night at local race tracks\". Although Stokes owned a local [[pool hall]],<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/> law enforcement officials stated that Stokes was officially listed as \"unemployed\"; and that he declared gambling income on his tax returns to account for his wealth.<ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nUnbeknownst to Stokes, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) was concluding an investigation and was preparing to serve him with a federal grand jury indictment for \"drug racketeering, operating a continuing criminal enterprise and income tax evasion\".<ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nGarfield Hammonds, assistant special agent in charge of the Chicago Drug Enforcement Administration said, \"Chicago has lost one of its biggest sources of supply for cocaine and heroin\", regarding Willie Stokes.<ref name=\"CTNKIA\"/>  Stokes was renowned for his flamboyance: usually wearing suits of fine silk, with his \"fingers weighted with diamond-cluster rings as big as silver dollars, his forearms festooned with gold bracelets, a gem-emblazoned watch on his right wrist and a gold chain with a diamond-studded 'F' for 'Flukey' around his neck.\" However, on the day he died he was wearing jogging clothes and no jewelry at all. The [[Cook County]] medical examiner recorded that Stokes died wearing \"blue sweatpants, powder blue undershorts, a red leather jacket, a red T-shirt underneath a blue T-shirt with the word 'Michigan' written on it, white sneakers, brown socks and a black cap.\"<ref name=\"CTNbw2\"/>\n\n== Funeral ==\n\nCompared to his son's funeral, \"Flukey\" Stokes' arrangements were considerably modest. The service was held at the A.R. Leak Funeral Home on 78th Street and S. Cottage Grove Avenue, which also conducted the ceremony for the younger Stokes.<ref name=\"ARLFH\"/> Over 7,000 people filed past Flukey's casket for a final glimpse of the slain mobster.<ref name=\"APKs\"/> Stokes was mostly spoken of with reverence by the crowd in attendance\u2014one young mourner said of Flukey: \"I was walking on the same street he was walking, I went up to him. I spoke to him. He spoke back. I introduced myself. He shook my hand and everything.\"<ref name=\"CTN7K\"/> Mothers were seen lifting their young children above the coffin so they could see Stokes; adorned for his final viewing. He was laid \"in a mahogany coffin with a custom-designed powder-blue interior\". Stokes wore tinted sun-glasses, \"a blue suit, blue silk shirt, blue tie and handkerchief and blue python shoes\" and he was holding a portable telephone. The floral arrangements that surrounded him included \"cars and dice fashioned from polystyrene foam, illustrating his passion for luxury automobiles and his claim on his income tax returns that his riches came from gambling.\"<ref name=\"CTN7K\"/>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"AutoSE-1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=5rMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=flukey+stokes&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jZdBU6LXM8TgsAS_o4DYDg&ved=0CD0Q6wEwAw#v=onepage&q=flukey%20stokes&f=false $200,000 Wedding Anniversary (Jet Magazine-January 28, 1985)]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoSE-2\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19090865 William Morris \"Flukey\" Stokes, Sr]. findagrave.com.

Stokes was from the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] and well known for his silk suits,<ref name=\"LLAP\"/> diamond rings, and flamboyant lifestyle<ref name=\"LATAP\"/> as a drug trafficking kingpin and [[pool hall]] owner.<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/> Stokes immortalized himself in Chicago by throwing a US$200,000 party on his 30th wedding anniversary in 1985 and for the decadent funeral he arranged for his murdered 28-year-old son, {{anchor|Willie \"the Wimp\" Stokes, Jr.}}Willie \"the Wimp\" Stokes, Jr. in February 1984.<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/><ref name=\"Tucker32\"/> The elder Stokes had his son buried in a Cadillac-style coffin with $100<!-- SOME SOURCES REPORT THESE AS $1,000 BILLS BUT THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INCORRECT BASED ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE JET MAGAZINE SOURCE WHICH VISUALLY CONFIRMS THAT THEY ARE IN FACT $100 BILLS. --> bills stuffed between his diamond ring-laden fingers.<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/> Two years later in November 1986, Flukey would also be murdered, along with his chauffeur, sitting inside a 1986 Cadillac limousine<ref name=\"LATReuters\"/> while talking on his wireless telephone. Stokes was 48 years old.<ref name=\"CTNDKSKIA\"/><ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\n== The Cadillac coffin ==\n\nWillie Stokes garnered international notoriety for the arrangements he made for his son Willie the Wimp's funeral.<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/> The younger Stokes followed his father's example trafficking narcotics and rivaled his dad's appetite for gambling. Flukey said of his son, \"[he was] a fine young man; he was very well liked and did a lot of gambling.\"<ref name=\"OCCT\"/> Willie the Wimp was buried in a custom-designed casket made to resemble a Cadillac Seville. At his viewing he was propped up in the coffin with his hands on the steering wheel. The casket had functioning headlights and taillights that blinked, whitewall tires, a windshield and a vanity license plate that read \"Wimp\", Stokes' nickname. He wore \"a flaming red suit, a jaunty gray hat and diamond rings. Several $100 bills stuck out from between his fingers.\"<ref name=\"Jetmag\"/><ref name=\"CTLBG\"/>\n\n== Sounds like a song ==\n\nBill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, of Austin, Texas were reading the Austin American-Statesman one morning and they read the syndicated column about Willie the Wimp. Carter said, \"I said to Ruth, 'This isn't a column\u2014it's a song'.\" They drove to the studio, and Carter said that \"in the two miles it took us to get there we put the column to music.\" [[Jimmie Vaughan]] was at the studio, and he called his brother, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], to tell him about it.<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> Stevie liked the song, recorded it, and performed it live for his fans around the world. Much of the songs lyrics came directly out of the column including a quote from Willie the Wimp's mother where she described her and her husband's reason for wanting an extravagant funeral for their son. She said that her son \"left like he lived\u2014in a lively manner.\"<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> It was worked into a verse in the song that says, \"In his Cadillac to heaven he was waving that banner; He left like he lived, in a lively manner.\"\n\n== \"Willie the Wimp\" ==\n\n[[Bill Carter (musician)|Bill Carter]] first released the song as \"Willy The Wimp (And His Cadillac Coffin)\" on his 1985 album, ''Stompin' Grounds''<ref name=\"dcdc\"/> [[Jimmie Vaughan]] played lead guitar on Carter's album, and his brother, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], released his version, titled: \"Willie the Wimp\" on his ''[[Live Alive]]'' album in July 1986.<ref name=\"ALMLA\"/> The blues-rock standard begins: \"Willie the Wimp was buried today, They laid him to rest in a special way\" which leads into a full description of the decadence that was Willie the Wimp's funeral. The song mentions \"the casketmobile, Willie the Wimp's red suit, the money between his fingers, [and] the headlights\" \u2013 into the catchy refrain, \"Talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp in his Cadillac coffin.\"<ref name=\"CTLBG\"/> Stevie Ray Vaughan performed the song live in concert at the [[Midtfyns Festival]] in [[Denmark]] in 1988.\n\n== Ambush and death ==\n\nNotwithstanding the $200,000 anniversary bash Flukey arranged for his wife, nor the wedding vows they renewed on that occasion, he was with a mistress the day he was murdered. Stokes was killed by two men who lay in wait for him as he stopped to drop off his girlfriend, Diane Miller, outside her residence on 79th Street and S. Ellis Avenue. On November 19, 1986, at 12:38&nbsp;a.m., a gunman armed with a 12-gauge pump shotgun, pointed at the windshield and shot out the glass. He then proceeded to fire off more shells through the vehicle's passenger side. Stokes died from gunshot wounds in his mouth and upper chest. His driver, Ronald Johnson, was killed by a second gunman; firing a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The woman ducked the assailant's line of fire sprawling the back seat and survived the attack; uninjured.<ref name=\"LLAP\"/><ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nStokes was described, by authorities, as: \"the richest and most flamboyant drug dealer on [Chicago's] South Side\"; further stating that \"[he] was known to win or lose as much as $250,000 over a single weekend in Las Vegas\" \u2013 and that he \"seldom missed a night at local race tracks\". Although Stokes owned a local [[pool hall]],<ref name=\"Deparle40\"/> law enforcement officials stated that Stokes was officially listed as \"unemployed\"; and that he declared gambling income on his tax returns to account for his wealth.<ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nUnbeknownst to Stokes, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) was concluding an investigation and was preparing to serve him with a federal grand jury indictment for \"drug racketeering, operating a continuing criminal enterprise and income tax evasion\".<ref name=\"CTNbw1\"/>\n\nGarfield Hammonds, assistant special agent in charge of the Chicago Drug Enforcement Administration said, \"Chicago has lost one of its biggest sources of supply for cocaine and heroin\", regarding Willie Stokes.<ref name=\"CTNKIA\"/>  Stokes was renowned for his flamboyance: usually wearing suits of fine silk, with his \"fingers weighted with diamond-cluster rings as big as silver dollars, his forearms festooned with gold bracelets, a gem-emblazoned watch on his right wrist and a gold chain with a diamond-studded 'F' for 'Flukey' around his neck.\" However, on the day he died he was wearing jogging clothes and no jewelry at all. The [[Cook County]] medical examiner recorded that Stokes died wearing \"blue sweatpants, powder blue undershorts, a red leather jacket, a red T-shirt underneath a blue T-shirt with the word 'Michigan' written on it, white sneakers, brown socks and a black cap.\"<ref name=\"CTNbw2\"/>\n\n== Funeral ==\n\nCompared to his son's funeral, \"Flukey\" Stokes' arrangements were considerably modest. The service was held at the A.R. Leak Funeral Home on 78th Street and S. Cottage Grove Avenue, which also conducted the ceremony for the younger Stokes.<ref name=\"ARLFH\"/> Over 7,000 people filed past Flukey's casket for a final glimpse of the slain mobster.<ref name=\"APKs\"/> Stokes was mostly spoken of with reverence by the crowd in attendance\u2014one young mourner said of Flukey: \"I was walking on the same street he was walking, I went up to him. I spoke to him. He spoke back. I introduced myself. He shook my hand and everything.\"<ref name=\"CTN7K\"/> Mothers were seen lifting their young children above the coffin so they could see Stokes; adorned for his final viewing. He was laid \"in a mahogany coffin with a custom-designed powder-blue interior\". Stokes wore tinted sun-glasses, \"a blue suit, blue silk shirt, blue tie and handkerchief and blue python shoes\" and he was holding a portable telephone. The floral arrangements that surrounded him included \"cars and dice fashioned from polystyrene foam, illustrating his passion for luxury automobiles and his claim on his income tax returns that his riches came from gambling.\"<ref name=\"CTN7K\"/>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"AutoSE-1\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=5rMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=flukey+stokes&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jZdBU6LXM8TgsAS_o4DYDg&ved=0CD0Q6wEwAw#v=onepage&q=flukey%20stokes&f=false $200,000 Wedding Anniversary (Jet Magazine-January 28, 1985)]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoSE-2\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19090865 William Morris \"Flukey\" Stokes, Sr]. findagrave.com.

It is being managed so as to restore it to its natural state by increasing the tree cover of the glen, reintroducing native animals which are no longer found in [[Great Britain]] and encouraging [[biodiversity]]. Alladale Wilderness Reserve is currently the United Kingdom's largest [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|wilderness engineering]] and [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] area.\n\n==Environmental degradation  and biodiversity losses in the British Isles==\n7,000 years ago, Britain was heavily forested. It would have been populated with wolves, bears, lynx, elk and a myriad of other large animals [https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth/Holocene]. But humans began to cut down a lot of the native forest, to make room for farmland. Almost all the large mammals had been forced into extinction by various means. Wolves were the last to go, becoming extinct in Scotland and Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. Britain 7,000 years ago probably would have looked more like the untamed wilderness of [[Alaska]], than the criss-cross of farmland seen today. The remotest highlands of Scotland prove to be the best candidates for [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] in Britain.\n\n==Background==\nThe Alladale estate was bought by English multimillionaire Paul Lister in 2003. The idea of a wilderness reserve was inspired by visits to [[South Africa|South Africa's]] ever popular [[game reserve]]s.   \nThe idea was to create an area of outstanding natural beauty, where animals previously extinct in Britain could be reintroduced. Letting nature return itself to an early [[Holocene]] setting by bringing in the right animals. This idea has been proven in South Africa, when over-grazed down graded farmland, was returned to its natural setting.\n\nArguably the most important aspect of the reserve are the predators. As deer are already common in the park, they over graze the land, and trample any saplings (impeding another important aspect, the regeneration of the rare Caledonian forest). This (in theory) should be a more effective way of balancing the deer population, than culling, which so far has poor results. Another positive aspect of reintroducing large predators is the increase in tourism (see [[Yellowstone National Park]]).\n\n==Wilderness reserve==\nThe reserve is part of Glen Alladale, a broad glacial valley surrounded by {{convert|2300|ft|adj=on}} mountains in a remote area near [[Ardgay]] in [[Sutherland]]. The Alladale estate of {{convert|23000|acre}} was purchased in 2003 by Paul Lister, an English philanthropist, who hopes to recreate a natural wooded landscape and reintroduce native animals including [[Predation|predators]] such as the [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]] and [[Eurasian brown bear|bear]]. The natural flora of the area consists of [[Scots pine]], [[oak]], [[aspen]], [[birch]], [[rowan]], [[holly]], [[willow]] and [[juniper]], but much of the tree cover has been lost and low heathers, grasses and sedges now predominate. In 2014, about 800,000 saplings of these native trees have been planted. A feasibility study to investigate the potential effects of a controlled release of wolves and bears into the area is planned for 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=In Scotland\u2019s Search for Roots, A Push to Restore Wild Lands |author=Caroline Fraser |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/in_scotlands_search_for_roots_a_push_to_restore_wild_lands/2319/ |newspaper=Yale Environment 360 |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>\n\nThe estate is an access route to the hill known as [[C\u00e0rn Ban]], which is a [[List of Marilyns in the Northern Highlands|Corbett]] in the [[Seana Bhr\u00e0igh]] mountain range.<ref name=\"Walkhighlands\">{{cite web | title=Carn Ban (Walkhighlands) | website=Walkhighlands | url=http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/corbetts/carn-ban | accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==Fauna==\nWild animals found living in the reserve include [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], [[European otter|otter]], [[red fox]], [[mountain hare]], [[European badger|badger]], [[European pine marten|pine marten]] and Britain's most threatened mammal, the [[European water vole|water vole]].

A part of the Tung Chung line was built along with the [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] and the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]]. The line currently travels through eight stations in 27 minutes along its route. The line is indicated by the colour orange.\n\n== History ==\nIn October 1989, the [[Hong Kong]] government announced [[Airport Core Programme|plans]] to build a new [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] on the remote island of [[Chek Lap Kok]] to replace the overcrowded [[Kai Tak International Airport]] at the heart of [[Kowloon]]. \n\nAs part of the initiative, the government invited the MTR Corporation to build a rail link to the new airport dubbed the Lantau Airport Railway. The project initially saw opposition from the Chinese government as it feared the construction would drain the monetary reserve of the Hong Kong government and leave the Chinese with nothing after the British handed the territory over in 1997. \n\nBoth the Chinese and British governments reached an agreement and construction commenced in November 1994.\n\nThe Lantau Airport rail link consists of two train lines, the Tung Chung line and the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]]. Both lines deploy the same [[MTR A-Stock EMU|rolling stock]] with minor differences in interior fittings and liveries.\n\nOn 21 June 1998, the Tung Chung line was officially opened by [[Hong Kong Chief Executive|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]], and service commenced the next day.\n\nOn 16 December 2003, an open house for charity took place at the recently completed [[Nam Cheong station]], an interchange between the Tung Chung line and soon to be opened [[West Rail line|West Rail&nbsp;line]]. The station then closed on 19 December 2003 in preparation for the opening of the new West Rail Line, and it was officially opened to public on 20 December 2003. Since then, the number of cars per train has increased from seven to eight to accommodate the additional patronage.\n\n[[Sunny Bay station]] opened on 1 June 2005 as an interchange for the [[Disneyland Resort line|Disneyland Resort&nbsp;line]].

It was later reduced to two tracks where both services share the same trackage. As a result, signal failures can affect both services.\n\n* Reduction on train traffic capacity on [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], [[Ma Wan Viaduct]], and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]]) means only one train can travel on either direction on any given time. The minimum [[headway]] between trains comes to 2 minutes 15 seconds, and forces some Tung Chung Line services from crossing the bridges into Lantau and terminate at Tsing Yi.\n\n* The signalling system is not capable of giving priority to the limited-stop Airport Express trains. Tung Chung Line trains  would sometimes stop at [[Sunny Bay Station]] for an extended period of time to give way to the Airport Express trains.\n\n* The power supply system restricts the number of trains running between Kowloon and Lai King stations. The system can accommodate a maximum of one Airport Express train and two Tung Chung trains to travel on both directions at the same time. This increases the minimum headway on the Tung Chung Line is 3.5 minutes.\n\n==Future development==\n{{main|North Island line|Tung Chung West station}}\n\nThe Tung Chung line was designed to facilitate an extension from [[Hong Kong station]] eastward. According to the Rail Projects Under Planning 2000 released by Hong Kong Highways Department, three new stations, [[Tamar station|Tamar]], [[Exhibition Centre station (MTR)|Exhibition Centre]] and [[Causeway Bay North station|Causeway Bay North]], will form part of the extension. The line will then connect [[North Point station]] and merge into the [[Tseung Kwan O line]]. However 14 years later on the Railway Development Strategy 2014 Tamar station would become the terminus for both the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line while Exhibition and Causeway Bay North stations would be served by the Tseung Kwan O line.\n\nResidents of [[Yat Tung Estate]] have appealed to the government to extend the Tung Chung line to [[Tung Chung West station]] near Yat Tung to ease their transportation problems. Yat Tung currently has 40,000 residents. They claimed that when they moved in 11 years ago, the Housing Bureau's documents indicated a MTR station at the estate. The residents currently have to take a 10-minute bus journey to [[Tung Chung station]].<ref>{{in lang|zh-hk}}[http://paper.wenweipo.com/2011/05/25/HK1105250005.htm \u9038\u6771\u90a8\u5c45\u6c11\u8981\u6c42\u5efa\u6e2f\u9435\u7ad9] ''Wen Wei Po''. 25 May 2011.</ref>\n\nOn April 7th 2020, it was announced by the Hong Kong government that the Tung Chung line will be extended by 1.3 kilometres to [[Tung Chung West station]], as well as building an intermediate station in [[Tung Chung East station]].

A part of the Tung Chung line was built along with the [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] and the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]]. The line currently travels through eight stations in 27 minutes along its route. The line is indicated by the colour orange.\n\n== History ==\nIn October 1989, the [[Hong Kong]] government announced [[Airport Core Programme|plans]] to build a new [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] on the remote island of [[Chek Lap Kok]] to replace the overcrowded [[Kai Tak International Airport]] at the heart of [[Kowloon]]. \n\nAs part of the initiative, the government invited the MTR Corporation to build a rail link to the new airport dubbed the Lantau Airport Railway. The project initially saw opposition from the Chinese government as it feared the construction would drain the monetary reserve of the Hong Kong government and leave the Chinese with nothing after the British handed the territory over in 1997. \n\nBoth the Chinese and British governments reached an agreement and construction commenced in November 1994.\n\nThe Lantau Airport rail link consists of two train lines, the Tung Chung line and the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]]. Both lines deploy the same [[MTR A-Stock EMU|rolling stock]] with minor differences in interior fittings and liveries.\n\nOn 21 June 1998, the Tung Chung line was officially opened by [[Hong Kong Chief Executive|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]], and service commenced the next day.\n\nOn 16 December 2003, an open house for charity took place at the recently completed [[Nam Cheong station]], an interchange between the Tung Chung line and soon to be opened [[West Rail line|West Rail&nbsp;line]]. The station then closed on 19 December 2003 in preparation for the opening of the new West Rail Line, and it was officially opened to public on 20 December 2003. Since then, the number of cars per train has increased from seven to eight to accommodate the additional patronage.\n\n[[Sunny Bay station]] opened on 1 June 2005 as an interchange for the [[Disneyland Resort line|Disneyland Resort&nbsp;line]]. The resort opened its door two months after the station became operational.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, four new [[MTR Rotem EMU|trains]] entered service to improve service frequency. The first train was delivered on 9 February 2006 and entered service on 12 June 2006. Modifications were added to the platforms to accommodate the new trains, which are a few millimetres wider than the original rolling stock.\n\n== Route map ==\n{|border=0 style=\"margin:auto\"\n|[[File:LAR ga map.png|center|thumb|upright=3|MTR Tung Chung line and [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] route map]]\n|}\n\n== Route description ==\nUnlike most other railway lines in the system, the Tung Chung Line travels mostly above ground and spans a greater distance.
