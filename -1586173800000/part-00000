In the aftermath of the [[Backpacker murders]], the case quickly attracted considerable public and legal attention both domestically and worldwide.

On 15 November 2000, the couple embarked on a trip to [[Nepal]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Australia]] (though recent news of the [[backpacker murders]], the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur killings]], and the [[Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire]] there had made their families anxious about that final leg of the trip).<ref name=\":0\" /> By 16 January 2001, the couple had arrived in [[Sydney]] on a [[working holiday visa]], and on 25 June, they departed on a road trip planned as Sydney to [[Canberra]], [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and [[Brisbane]].\n\nAround 7:30 pm on the night of Saturday 14 July 2001, Falconio and Lees were travelling on the [[Stuart Highway]] bound for the [[Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve|Devil's Marbles]] in their orange [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi]]. Falconio was driving and Lees sat next to him in the passenger seat. The two had been conscious of a car that had been following them since they stopped at a roadhouse in [[Barrow Creek, Northern Territory|Barrow Creek]], and were expecting to be overtaken. However, when the vehicle - a white Toyota [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]] with a green canopy - drew alongside, the driver gestured excitedly at them to pull over. Falconio stopped the van and went to speak with the man, who had pulled off the road ahead of them. The man explained he had seen sparks shooting out of the van's exhaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lees-relives-night-she-feared-shed-die/2005/10/18/1129401256767.html|title=Lees relives night she feared she'd die|last1=Murdoch|first1=Lindsay|date=19 October 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lees-identifies-murdoch-in-court/2005/10/18/1129401234976.html|title='I thought I was going to die', says sobbing Lees|date=18 October 2005|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe two went to the rear of the vehicle to investigate, and Lees moved into the driver's seat, ready to rev the engine. She then heard a loud bang from the rear of the van, and moments later the man was at the window brandishing a silver gun.<ref name=\":0\" /> He climbed into the van, and she let him secure her hands behind her back with black cable ties, but fought the tying of her feet and taping of her mouth. Lees was then dragged to the man's vehicle (noticing the man's dog), but, fearing [[rape]], she fled into the [[The bush| bush]] while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body).<ref name=\":0\" /> The man searched for her before leaving, passing nearby three times, but she hid before finally flagging down a [[road train]] driver at 12:35 am, who took her back to Barrow Creek.\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe [[Northern Territory Police|Alice Springs Police]] were called around 1:30 am, arrived to collect evidence and testimonies at around 4:20 am, and (accompanied by the truck driver) commenced a search for Falconio, the vehicle, and the gunman at 7:00 am.<ref name=\":0\" /> Returning to the scene, they found a dirt-covered blood pool and the couple's Kombi hidden some 80 metres into the scrub. It was not until eight hours after the rescue that roadblocks were put in place on the twelve likely roads exiting the district. Police searches of the area in the following months revealed little except Lees' footprints, but four [[Aboriginal tracker]]s arrived from a nearby settlement within a few days, though none of them found evidence of Falconio nor the attacker.\n\nGiven the unusual nature of the attack, and the lack of corroborating evidence (i.e. Falconio's belongings or body), it took the police some days to appreciate the significance of the crime. But in the wake of the Backpacker case, the media were quick to [[sensationalism|sensationalise]] Lees' story as one of survival in a crime of unusual horror against all odds.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, inconsistencies in Lees' statements and her demeanour in the following weeks shifted attention to the veracity of her version of the incident (e.g. the perpetrator's [[facial composite]], the actual type of vehicle or dog, and assumed [[CCTV]] footage of the suspect in [[Alice Springs]]), similar to what had happened in the [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain#Media involvement and bias|Azaria Chamberlain case.]] A $250,000 reward was posted, but the only new evidence in the Falconio case was an unidentified male-[[DNA]] trace on Lees' T-shirt, and some related DNA on the cable ties and Kombi gearstick.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPolice were hopeful that the release of the CCTV footage would lead to the person shown coming forward to remove themselves from suspicion. When this did not happen, investigators began to focus on the registered owners of the 1991-1999 model [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] 4WD identified, and on the 36 men whom callers had identified in the footage.<ref name=\":0\" /> Based on these results, police interviewed [[Bradley John Murdoch]] in Broome on 1 November 2001, though Lees' descriptions did not immediately connect the case to him and no DNA sample was collected.<ref name=\":0\" /> On 17 May 2002, the investigating task force caught Murdoch's drug-running accomplice, who began to relate details of his connections to the case, and a DNA examination of Murdoch's brother also supported his involvement. Murdoch then disappeared, but on 22 August 2002 he was arrested and tried on an unrelated kidnap and assault charge by [[South Australia Police]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Murder trial ==\nAfter [[extradition]], a committal hearing began in April 2005. The trial began on 17 October 2005 before the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]] in Darwin. To cope with the demands of the trial and the huge media contingent covering the proceedings, the court building in Darwin was renovated at a cost of [[Australian dollar|A$]]900,000.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Churchman|first1=Fiona|title=Darwin prepares for the Falconio case|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2004/04/22/1092831.htm|accessdate=4 February 2017|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=22 April 2004}}</ref> The [[judge]] was [[Brian Ross Martin]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], [[Chief Justice of the Northern Territory]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/nt-chief-justice-martin-retires-20100528-wl31.html|title=NT Chief Justice Martin retires|date=28 May 2010|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref> Murdoch pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Falconio and assaulting and attempting to kidnap Lees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/outback-murder-trial-begins-1-1100626|title=Outback murder trial begins|date=17 October 2005|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nLees had identified Murdoch from police photographs shown to her in November 2002 and finally face-to-face during the trial on 18 October. She also told the court that her assailant tied her wrists together behind her, put a sack over her head and forced her into his [[Pickup truck#The Australian ute|ute]], stating that the person forced her between the seats of and into the rear of his vehicle. Lees said she escaped from the ute and fled into the dark, hiding under bushes, while he tried to find her with a torch. Expert trackers, however, could find no sign of tracks other than Lees' in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barkham|first1=Patrick|title=Outback case doubts echo dingo baby hue and cry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/28/world.patrickbarkham|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 July 2001}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch was found to have left Alice Springs at a time and in a direction that could have led to him being at or around Barrow Creek at the time of the murder. Expert testimony presented at the trial indicated that Murdoch was the man captured in the CCTV footage at the service station at 12:38 am. The police found traces of his DNA on a pair of homemade handcuffs that Murdoch had used in the attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4524084.stm|title=Outback killer trapped by DNA link|last=Mercer|first=Phil|date=13 December 2005|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> This, combined with the DNA match on Lees' T-shirt, allowed Murdoch to be charged with the murder.<ref name=\":0\" /> The T-shirt DNA was found to be \"150 [[quadrillion]] times more likely [to] belong to Murdoch\" than anyone else.<ref name=\"news.com.au\">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/an-insight-into-bradley-john-murdochs-mind-the-man-who-killed-falconio/story-fncynjr2-1226616889526|title=An insight into Bradley John Murdoch's mind - the killer of Peter Falconio|date=10 April 2013|newspaper=News.com.au|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch's [[defense (law)|defence]] argued during the trial that the DNA match could have been due to accidental blood transfer in an Alice Springs [[Red Rooster]] restaurant prior to the alleged offence, or could have been simply planted by persons unknown. Further samples were found to be contaminated and were not presented as evidence. Murdoch gave evidence that he had stopped at the restaurant to buy chicken for himself and his dog. During the committal hearing, Lees at one stage mentioned that she and Falconio had stopped at Red Rooster.\n\nEyewitnesses claimed they had seen Falconio at a petrol station, a week after he went missing. Prosecutor Rex Wild, QC, dismissed these claims, arguing that each account gave conflicting information, in particular about the man's hair colour. He pointed out that the police had followed up various eye-witness accounts, all of which had proven fruitless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/qc-says-murdoch-a-cunning-killer/2005/12/07/1133829661046.html|title=QC says Murdoch a cunning killer|last=Murdoch|first=Lindsay|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> Falconio's body has never been found \"despite one of the most exhaustive police investigations ever seen in Australia\".<ref name=\"Mercer\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4484814.stm|title=Bradley Murdoch takes the stand|last=Mercer|first=Phil|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=30 November 2005}}</ref> On 13 December 2005, Murdoch was found guilty by a jury in a unanimous verdict and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a [[Parole (law)|non-parole]] period of 28 years.

His lawyers lodged eight grounds of appeal. Murdoch claimed the evidence of Lees was tainted because she had seen a photograph of him on the internet before she was interviewed by police, as well as an article linking him to the murder.<ref name=\"abcappeal\">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200612/s1810149.htm Evidence questioned in Murdoch appeal] Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 12 December 2006</ref> On 10 January 2007, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal (NT CCA) dismissed both limbs of the appeal.<ref>[http://www.nt.gov.au/ntsc/doc/judgements/2007/ntcca/20070110ntcca01.html Murdoch v The Queen &#91;2007&#93; NTCCA 1]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1824324.htm Falconio killer loses appeal], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 10 January 2007.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25427808|title=Falconio killer in second appeal|date=18 December 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=2 March 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch then applied for Special Leave to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]]. On 21 June 2007, the High Court refused to grant Special Leave. Under the Australian judicial system, Murdoch has now exhausted all opportunities of appeal.

The man explained he had seen sparks shooting out of the van's exhaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lees-relives-night-she-feared-shed-die/2005/10/18/1129401256767.html|title=Lees relives night she feared she'd die|last1=Murdoch|first1=Lindsay|date=19 October 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lees-identifies-murdoch-in-court/2005/10/18/1129401234976.html|title='I thought I was going to die', says sobbing Lees|date=18 October 2005|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe two went to the rear of the vehicle to investigate, and Lees moved into the driver's seat, ready to rev the engine. She then heard a loud bang from the rear of the van, and moments later the man was at the window brandishing a silver gun.<ref name=\":0\" /> He climbed into the van, and she let him secure her hands behind her back with black cable ties, but fought the tying of her feet and taping of her mouth. Lees was then dragged to the man's vehicle (noticing the man's dog), but, fearing [[rape]], she fled into the [[The bush| bush]] while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body).<ref name=\":0\" /> The man searched for her before leaving, passing nearby three times, but she hid before finally flagging down a [[road train]] driver at 12:35 am, who took her back to Barrow Creek.\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe [[Northern Territory Police|Alice Springs Police]] were called around 1:30 am, arrived to collect evidence and testimonies at around 4:20 am, and (accompanied by the truck driver) commenced a search for Falconio, the vehicle, and the gunman at 7:00 am.<ref name=\":0\" /> Returning to the scene, they found a dirt-covered blood pool and the couple's Kombi hidden some 80 metres into the scrub. It was not until eight hours after the rescue that roadblocks were put in place on the twelve likely roads exiting the district. Police searches of the area in the following months revealed little except Lees' footprints, but four [[Aboriginal tracker]]s arrived from a nearby settlement within a few days, though none of them found evidence of Falconio nor the attacker.\n\nGiven the unusual nature of the attack, and the lack of corroborating evidence (i.e. Falconio's belongings or body), it took the police some days to appreciate the significance of the crime. But in the wake of the Backpacker case, the media were quick to [[sensationalism|sensationalise]] Lees' story as one of survival in a crime of unusual horror against all odds.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, inconsistencies in Lees' statements and her demeanour in the following weeks shifted attention to the veracity of her version of the incident (e.g. the perpetrator's [[facial composite]], the actual type of vehicle or dog, and assumed [[CCTV]] footage of the suspect in [[Alice Springs]]), similar to what had happened in the [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain#Media involvement and bias|Azaria Chamberlain case.]] A $250,000 reward was posted, but the only new evidence in the Falconio case was an unidentified male-[[DNA]] trace on Lees' T-shirt, and some related DNA on the cable ties and Kombi gearstick.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPolice were hopeful that the release of the CCTV footage would lead to the person shown coming forward to remove themselves from suspicion. When this did not happen, investigators began to focus on the registered owners of the 1991-1999 model [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] 4WD identified, and on the 36 men whom callers had identified in the footage.<ref name=\":0\" /> Based on these results, police interviewed [[Bradley John Murdoch]] in Broome on 1 November 2001, though Lees' descriptions did not immediately connect the case to him and no DNA sample was collected.<ref name=\":0\" /> On 17 May 2002, the investigating task force caught Murdoch's drug-running accomplice, who began to relate details of his connections to the case, and a DNA examination of Murdoch's brother also supported his involvement. Murdoch then disappeared, but on 22 August 2002 he was arrested and tried on an unrelated kidnap and assault charge by [[South Australia Police]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Murder trial ==\nAfter [[extradition]], a committal hearing began in April 2005. The trial began on 17 October 2005 before the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]] in Darwin.

She also told the court that her assailant tied her wrists together behind her, put a sack over her head and forced her into his [[Pickup truck#The Australian ute|ute]], stating that the person forced her between the seats of and into the rear of his vehicle. Lees said she escaped from the ute and fled into the dark, hiding under bushes, while he tried to find her with a torch.

During the committal hearing, Lees at one stage mentioned that she and Falconio had stopped at Red Rooster.\n\nEyewitnesses claimed they had seen Falconio at a petrol station, a week after he went missing.

The station is located off Shore Avenue between Maxwell and Larabee Avenues. It is a sheltered concrete elevated platform that stands in the shadows of the original station, which was accessible from the ends of Maxwell, Audrey, and Hamilton Avenues. Both stations exist along the south side of Roosevelt Park.\n\nThe original Oyster Bay station was built on June 25, 1889 and remodeled in 1902. At one point there were plans to extend the line east towards the [[Port Jefferson Branch]]. There was also a large pier built to facilitate the loading of passenger cars onto a short-lived ferry to Wilson's Point in [[South Norwalk, Connecticut]] that is now owned by the Flowers Oyster Company.

This ferry, called the Cape Charles would take passengers to Connecticut where the railways would be connected to the Housatonic Railroad and continue on to Boston.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The wolf has a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}.

The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago.

One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture.

Scent marking involves urine, feces, and anal gland scents. This is more effective at advertising territory than howling and is often used in combination with scratch marks. Wolves increase their rate of scent marking when they encounter the marks of wolves from other packs. Lone wolves will rarely mark, but newly bonded pairs will scent mark the most.<ref name=Paquet2003/> These marks are generally left every {{convert|240|m|yd|abbr=on}} throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions. Such markers can last for two to three weeks,{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=19\u201326}} and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees, or the skeletons of large animals.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality, one study concluding that 14\u201365% of wolf deaths in Minnesota and the [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] were due to other wolves.<ref name=Mech2003/>\n\n[[Wolf communication|Wolves communicate]] to anticipate what their pack mates or other wolves might do next.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=67}} This includes the use of vocalization, body posture, scent, touch, and taste.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=66\u2013103}} The phases of the moon have no effect on wolf vocalization, and despite popular belief, wolves do not howl at the moon.{{sfn|Busch|2007|p=59}} Wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after hunts, to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site, to locate each other during a storm, while crossing unfamiliar territory, and to communicate across great distances.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=38}} Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Paquet2003/> Other vocalizations include growls, barks and whines.

When building dens, females make use of natural shelters like fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. On rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with one to three openings. The den is usually constructed not more than {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} away from a water source. It typically faces southwards where it can be better warmed by sunlight exposure, and the snow can thaw more quickly. Resting places, play areas for the pups, and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens. The odor of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds like [[magpie]]s and [[raven]]s. Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near [[Architecture|domiciles]], paved [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=234\u2013238}} During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 62\u201375 days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra. Young females give birth to four to five young, and older females from six to eight young and up to 14. Their mortality rate is 60\u201380%.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}} Newborn wolf pups look similar to [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dog]] pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=47}} They are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh {{convert|300|\u2013|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after three weeks. At one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks. They have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}}{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=46\u201349}} Wolf pups begin play-fighting at the age of three weeks, though unlike young coyotes and foxes, their bites are gentle and controlled.

The optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nAs well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. This is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. In laboratory tests they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. {{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} To survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems\u2014finding a prey animal, then confronting it.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Tracking====\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a wolf trotting across an arid terrain|An Indian wolf trotting at [[Blackbuck National Park]]]]\n\nWolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=233}} Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometers. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=240}}\n\nThe wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=32}} On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of {{convert|50|-|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The wolf has a running gait of {{convert|55|-|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, can leap {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.<ref name=Nowak1983/> A wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. A wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to {{cvt|76|km|mi}} in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nWolves carry their heads at the same level as their back, raising it only when alert.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} In one study, wolves detected moose using scent 10 times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow. Their vision is as good as that of humans, and they can smell prey at least {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. One wolf travelled to a herd {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. A human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance if it is downwind. The wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog. Both have a sense of smell at least 10,000 times more sensitive than that of humans.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Pursuit====\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an American bison standing its ground surrounded by six wolves in winter|An [[American bison]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] standing its ground. Bison, elk, and moose will usually stand their ground against a pack of wolves.]]\nIf successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. Most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. Wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down [[bison]], elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} Although people often believe that wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=7}}\n\nGenerally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. Wolves can run at {{convert|56|-|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} across several kilometers and will often pursue prey for at least {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}. One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes. Most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Disablement====\nThe wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} After chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} fangs and its powerful [[masseter muscle]]s to deliver a [[Bite force quotient|bite force]] of {{convert|28|kg/cm2|lb/in2|abbr=on}}, which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. The wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. One wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=28\u201345}}<ref name=Peterson2007/><ref name=Buskirk1978/> Hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]] with the canine teeth. These leave gaping skin perforations over {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of [[hamstringing]]. Attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the [[perineum]].<ref name=Buskirk1978/> Wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=82\u201389}}\n[[File:Wolves eating deer.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of two wolves eating a deer carcass at night|Two wolves feeding on a [[white-tailed deer]] kill]]\nWith medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute.

When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated.

Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The wolf has a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}.

The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture. The [[red wolf]] of the [[southeastern United States]] is a hybrid animal with 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry.

Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal their kills or even kill them,{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=264\u2013265}} while one-to-one encounters tend to be dominated by the cat. There are several documented cases of cougars killing wolves.<ref name=Jimenez2008/> Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the feline's behaviour.<ref name=Elbroch2015/> Wolf and [[Siberian tiger]] interactions are well-documented in the [[Russian Far East]], where tigers significantly depress wolf numbers, sometimes to the point of [[Local extinction|localized extinction]]. Only human depletion of tiger numbers appears to protect wolves from [[competitive exclusion]] from them.

Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact.

In 1998, near the same location, three researchers sighted a pack consisting of four adult and three sub-adult wolves and one striped hyena. The hyena was moving in the middle of the pack and not following behind it. It is proposed that the hyena could benefit from the wolves' superior ability to hunt large, agile prey. The wolves could benefit from the hyena's superior sense of smell, to locate and dig out tortoises, to crack open large bones, and to tear open discarded food containers like tin cans.<ref name=Dinets2016/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n{{anchor|Behaviour}}\n{{See also|Dog behaviour}}\n\n=== Social structure ===\n{{See also|Attachment behaviour in wolves}}\n[[File:Canis lupus pallipes Mysore Zoo 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of three wolves running and biting each other|Indian wolves at the [[Mysore Zoo]]]]\n\nThe wolf is a [[Sociality|social animal]].{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Its populations consist of packs and lone wolves, most lone wolves being temporarily alone while they disperse from packs to form their own or join another one.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=164}} The wolf's basic social unit is the [[nuclear family]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The average pack size in North America is eight wolves and in Europe five to six wolves.<ref name=Miklosi2015/> The average pack across Eurasia consists of a family of five to 11 wolves (two adults, three to six juveniles, and one to three yearlings),{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} or sometimes two or three such families,<ref name=Paquet2003/> with examples of exceptionally large packs consisting of up to 42 wolves being known.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=2\u20133, 28}} [[Cortisol]] levels in wolves rise significantly when a pack member dies, indicating the presence of stress.<ref name=Molnar2015/> During times of prey abundance caused by calving or migration, different wolf packs may join together temporarily.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nOffspring typically stay in the pack for 10\u201354 months before dispersing.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=1\u20132}} Triggers for dispersal include the onset of [[sexual maturity]] and competition within the pack for food.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=12\u201313}} The distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group, while other individuals may travel great distances of upwards of {{convert|206|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|390|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|670|km|mi|abbr=on}} from their natal (birth) packs.<ref name=Nowak1983/> A new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female, travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=38}} Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold and typically kill them.

When building dens, females make use of natural shelters like fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. On rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with one to three openings. The den is usually constructed not more than {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} away from a water source. It typically faces southwards where it can be better warmed by sunlight exposure, and the snow can thaw more quickly. Resting places, play areas for the pups, and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens. The odor of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds like [[magpie]]s and [[raven]]s.

They weigh {{convert|300|\u2013|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after three weeks. At one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks.

Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking.

In laboratory tests they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. {{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} To survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems\u2014finding a prey animal, then confronting it.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Tracking====\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a wolf trotting across an arid terrain|An Indian wolf trotting at [[Blackbuck National Park]]]]\n\nWolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=233}} Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometers. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=240}}\n\nThe wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other.

A wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to {{cvt|76|km|mi}} in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nWolves carry their heads at the same level as their back, raising it only when alert.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} In one study, wolves detected moose using scent 10 times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow.

Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators.

The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours.

Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste.

Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s.

Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men. During the 50 years to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 200 in southern Asia.<ref name=\"Linnell\" />\n\n==== Human hunting of wolves ====\n{{Main|Wolf hunting|Wolf hunting with dogs}}\n{{See also|Wolf hunting#Quarry|l1=Human uses of hunted wolves}}\n[[File:Provedenie meropriyatii po otstrelu vrednyh givotnyh na territorii Kamyshinskogo raiona Volgogradskoi oblasti.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men with guns pose behind nine carcasses of hunted wolves|Carcasses of hunted wolves in [[Volgograd Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] stated that wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs.<ref name=\"Roosevelt\"/> Historic methods included killing of spring-born litters in their dens, [[coursing]] with dogs (usually combinations of [[sighthound]]s, [[Bloodhound]]s and [[Fox Terrier]]s), poisoning with [[strychnine]], and [[trapping]].{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=108}}{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}}\n\nA popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with [[fladry]] poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s. Although closely related to domestic dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively. A person is more likely to be fatally mauled by a pet wolf or wolf-dog hybrid than by a dog.<ref name=\"Tucker1998\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Alaska2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wolfhunting.main|title=Wolf Hunting in Alaska|last1=State of Alaska|date=29 October 2019|website=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|access-date=2019-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930014610/https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wolfhunting.main|archive-date=30 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Anderson2009>{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = T.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nThe government in Ireland released sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Henya sacrificed everything to give Margaret a better life. Around two decades later, Joseph and Margaret's son Marco Montenegro, the future heir of the Montenegro's wine business, develops feelings for Emily Cardenas, the daughter of an old worker in their hacienda. Marco gives Emily the Infinity Ring, which means \"eternity\", as a symbol of their love for each other. However, Margaret's schemes to ruin Emily's relationship with Marco prompts him to marry rich banker Jane Bonifacio, much to the detriment of Emily, who throws the ring away and vows revenge against the Montenegros. One night, Margaret and Henya had a heated misunderstanding about Joseph's love for Henya. Henya decides to leave the mansion so Margaret can live in peace.\n\nYears after Joseph's death, laborer William Alcantara settle in Olivarez with his children Katerina, Onat and Tomas. When Onat died from a deadly flu and the Montenegros migrate to the [[United States]], William adopts a street boy named Daniel into the hacienda Alcantara, where Henya assumes her role as Daniel's adoptive grandmother. Daniel and Katerina become best friends and they gradually develop a very close relationship over the next several years. Tomas remains very resentful towards Daniel and has an addiction to gambling. Margaret, Marco and Jane returns home with their children Nathan and Johanna, who are both becoming interested in Katerina and Daniel respectively. Unknown to everyone else, Emily returns to the country along with her assistant Miguel Ramos, as they begin investigating the Montenegros. After William dies of a severe heart attack, Tomas takes over the hacienda Alcantara with help from Margaret, and he succeeds in destroying Daniel's life, forcing Katerina to live with the Montenegros, and helping Nathan to marry Katerina. Daniel is fatally stabbed by Tomas and plunges down into the waterfalls, but is found alive by Emily and Miguel. Upon recovering, Daniel is heartbroken seeing Katerina and Nathan together and he agrees to live with Emily in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in order to become stronger. Emily tells Daniel about her life in Milan and she has flashbacks of working multiple jobs until she married a rich old man named Marcelo Guidotti.\n\nTwo years later, Emily and Daniel returns to the Philippines after learning that Nathan and Katerina are going to be married. However, Daniel fails to arrive in time to stop the wedding. The Guidottis eventually open their wine business to plan their own counter-strike against the Montenegros. Johanna learns the truth from Emily that she is adopted. Daniel and Katerina eventually realize that they still have feelings for each other, but Nathan is secretly watching over them. Henya tries to convince Marco and Emily that Daniel is their biological son. DNA testing confirmed positive results, but Miguel manipulates the results (because of his growing obsession to Emily) and secretly allies himself with Margaret. After the truth is eventually revealed, Daniel agrees to live in the Montenegro mansion to spend more time with Marco as his father, and Emily is reluctant to accept it. Margaret orders Miguel to separate Marco and Emily, but takes a nasty turn when Jane is seemingly killed in a plane bombing by Miguel's accomplice David Conde. With Margaret's reluctant help, Miguel manages to steal billions of money from the Guidotti Imports and the Bonifacio Bank to put into bankruptcy. Later on, Daniel and Miguel eventually confronts each other, but Miguel flees with the money he stole and hides from the authorities. Daniel decides to leave the Montenegro mansion to take care of Emily and Henya.\n\nOne year after losing the Guidotti Imports, Emily and Daniel work on their own jobs as Tomas and Nathan try to make their lives miserable. Jane's cousin Jean Bonifacio appears and takes over the Bonifacio Bank that figured in the collapse of Guidotti Imports. Under a cover identity named Black Lily, Jean secretly sends flowers and also meddles in Emily and Marco's relationship as the lovers are engaged. Jean has flashbacks that reveals she is actually Jane, who miraculously survived the plane crash and underwent plastic surgery. Tomas becomes the new president of Guidotti Imports by using the money from Miguel, who is driven by his obsession with Emily and continues to threaten Margaret. Katerina continues to suffer a miserable life with Nathan as his insanity gets too far. Daniel and Katerina attempts to elope together, but Katerina gets abducted by Tomas, and as Johanna discovers the hiding place and tells a depressed Nathan about the location, Nathan confronts and rapes Katerina. She becomes pregnant and runs away to hide in a far-off location, prompting Daniel to persevere in finding her. Whilst hiding from Nathan, Daniel and Katerina eventually reunite in the province of [[Albay]] and they discover that Katerina's mother Luisa is alive. Marco and Emily makes a surprise wedding night, but Jean stops them by unmasking her true identity as Jane. After she grants Marco's request for an annulment, Jane gets kidnapped by Miguel, and as Margaret attempts to rescue her, she failed as Miguel shoots Jane to death. Emily manages to lure Miguel into her trap so the authorities can arrest him. Daniel gets into a heated fistfight with Nathan, who stabs himself to frame up Daniel. To save Katerina and Henya's life from Nathan, Daniel surrenders himself to the police for frustrated murder, and reunites with Miguel in jail. Nathan still threatens Katerina, while Daniel is fatally stabbed by a prison mate, sending him into a coma.\n\nAfter recovering at a hospital and was released from prison, Daniel vows to stop Nathan from taking Katerina away from him. A reformed Margaret admits that Katerina and Nathan's marriage is null and void because the wedding priest's license was already expired. Daniel finds Nathan and Katerina at the airport, and Johanna tells them the truth about Nathan's fake marriage. Margaret reconciles with Henya before surrendering herself to the police for all her crimes and her alliance with Miguel. Emily and Marco finally get married in the United States, while Miguel fakes his death at the [[Jones Bridge]] by getting multiple shots from a sniper by David (under the orders of Tomas) and plunges down into the river. Margaret is finally forgiven by Emily, Marco and Daniel. Nathan tries hard to redeem himself for the better (so he can make Katerina love him again), but Tomas manipulates the whole situation by telling Nathan that Katerina and Daniel are going to be married. More confrontations ensued, Daniel admits that Nathan is the father of Katerina's child, and Katerina explains to everyone how she was raped by Nathan. Marco, Emily and Johanna talks about putting Nathan to a mental hospital, but Nathan overhears them and panics, and as he desperately kidnaps Katerina, Daniel chases after them. An all-out fistfight between Daniel and Nathan results in Katerina suffering a miscarriage. Marco and Emily commits Nathan to a [[psychiatric hospital]], while a mourning Katerina angrily blames Tomas and Nathan for the death of her unborn child. Weeks later, everyone is preparing for Daniel and Katerina's wedding, and Emily learns that the Infinity Ring that Katerina holds for Daniel is the same ring that she had with Marco in the past. Tomas gets banned after a bomb threat in the Montenegro mansion, but Margaret is given a special permit to attend the wedding. Daniel and Katerina are finally married with a grand wedding in [[Intramuros]]. At the wedding reception, Margaret announces new positions for the Montenegro Corporation, including Emily as chief operating officer and Daniel as new president of the company. Daniel and Katerina spend their honeymoon at [[San Francisco]]. Afterwards, the couple returns home with a brand new wine that will be used in the company's relaunch. Tomas' business becomes bankrupt and Miguel wants his money back, while Daniel comes up with a plan bring down Tomas. In the [[Masquerade ball]] at Emily's birthday, Daniel gives her mother a surprise gift with the merge of Montenegro Corporation and Guidotti Imports and the return of Infinity Wine to the company, and Tomas gets very enraged at the Montenegros and Katerina. However, everyone realizes that Miguel is still alive.\n\nDaniel eventually face off in a final showdown with Miguel and Tomas, who kidnaps Katerina and Emily respectively. However, Miguel fatally shoots Katerina and Daniel and the couple ends up in the hospital, but Marco arrives to rescue Emily and kills Miguel in self-defense. Katerina eventually dies at the hospital, and as Daniel mourns at her grave for so many days, Tomas blames him for his sister's death and kills him, much to the anguish of Emily and Henya. In the epilogue, the Montenegros now live together in the hacienda Alcantara, where Henya and Margaret are thinking about Daniel and Katerina being reunited in the afterlife. Emily and Marco have their own baby, named Daniel. Nathan is released from the psychiatric hospital and returns home with his family. Tomas is sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and is visited by Luisa and Johanna. Several years later, new neighbors visits the hacienda Alcantara during a [[Christmas]] gathering where the young Daniel meets the couple's daughter named Catherine.

Henya sacrificed everything to give Margaret a better life. Around two decades later, Joseph and Margaret's son Marco Montenegro, the future heir of the Montenegro's wine business, develops feelings for Emily Cardenas, the daughter of an old worker in their hacienda. Marco gives Emily the Infinity Ring, which means \"eternity\", as a symbol of their love for each other. However, Margaret's schemes to ruin Emily's relationship with Marco prompts him to marry rich banker Jane Bonifacio, much to the detriment of Emily, who throws the ring away and vows revenge against the Montenegros. One night, Margaret and Henya had a heated misunderstanding about Joseph's love for Henya. Henya decides to leave the mansion so Margaret can live in peace.\n\nYears after Joseph's death, laborer William Alcantara settle in Olivarez with his children Katerina, Onat and Tomas. When Onat died from a deadly flu and the Montenegros migrate to the [[United States]], William adopts a street boy named Daniel into the hacienda Alcantara, where Henya assumes her role as Daniel's adoptive grandmother. Daniel and Katerina become best friends and they gradually develop a very close relationship over the next several years. Tomas remains very resentful towards Daniel and has an addiction to gambling. Margaret, Marco and Jane returns home with their children Nathan and Johanna, who are both becoming interested in Katerina and Daniel respectively. Unknown to everyone else, Emily returns to the country along with her assistant Miguel Ramos, as they begin investigating the Montenegros. After William dies of a severe heart attack, Tomas takes over the hacienda Alcantara with help from Margaret, and he succeeds in destroying Daniel's life, forcing Katerina to live with the Montenegros, and helping Nathan to marry Katerina. Daniel is fatally stabbed by Tomas and plunges down into the waterfalls, but is found alive by Emily and Miguel. Upon recovering, Daniel is heartbroken seeing Katerina and Nathan together and he agrees to live with Emily in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in order to become stronger. Emily tells Daniel about her life in Milan and she has flashbacks of working multiple jobs until she married a rich old man named Marcelo Guidotti.\n\nTwo years later, Emily and Daniel returns to the Philippines after learning that Nathan and Katerina are going to be married. However, Daniel fails to arrive in time to stop the wedding. The Guidottis eventually open their wine business to plan their own counter-strike against the Montenegros. Johanna learns the truth from Emily that she is adopted. Daniel and Katerina eventually realize that they still have feelings for each other, but Nathan is secretly watching over them. Henya tries to convince Marco and Emily that Daniel is their biological son. DNA testing confirmed positive results, but Miguel manipulates the results (because of his growing obsession to Emily) and secretly allies himself with Margaret. After the truth is eventually revealed, Daniel agrees to live in the Montenegro mansion to spend more time with Marco as his father, and Emily is reluctant to accept it. Margaret orders Miguel to separate Marco and Emily, but takes a nasty turn when Jane is seemingly killed in a plane bombing by Miguel's accomplice David Conde. With Margaret's reluctant help, Miguel manages to steal billions of money from the Guidotti Imports and the Bonifacio Bank to put into bankruptcy. Later on, Daniel and Miguel eventually confronts each other, but Miguel flees with the money he stole and hides from the authorities. Daniel decides to leave the Montenegro mansion to take care of Emily and Henya.\n\nOne year after losing the Guidotti Imports, Emily and Daniel work on their own jobs as Tomas and Nathan try to make their lives miserable. Jane's cousin Jean Bonifacio appears and takes over the Bonifacio Bank that figured in the collapse of Guidotti Imports. Under a cover identity named Black Lily, Jean secretly sends flowers and also meddles in Emily and Marco's relationship as the lovers are engaged. Jean has flashbacks that reveals she is actually Jane, who miraculously survived the plane crash and underwent plastic surgery. Tomas becomes the new president of Guidotti Imports by using the money from Miguel, who is driven by his obsession with Emily and continues to threaten Margaret. Katerina continues to suffer a miserable life with Nathan as his insanity gets too far. Daniel and Katerina attempts to elope together, but Katerina gets abducted by Tomas, and as Johanna discovers the hiding place and tells a depressed Nathan about the location, Nathan confronts and rapes Katerina. She becomes pregnant and runs away to hide in a far-off location, prompting Daniel to persevere in finding her. Whilst hiding from Nathan, Daniel and Katerina eventually reunite in the province of [[Albay]] and they discover that Katerina's mother Luisa is alive. Marco and Emily makes a surprise wedding night, but Jean stops them by unmasking her true identity as Jane. After she grants Marco's request for an annulment, Jane gets kidnapped by Miguel, and as Margaret attempts to rescue her, she failed as Miguel shoots Jane to death. Emily manages to lure Miguel into her trap so the authorities can arrest him. Daniel gets into a heated fistfight with Nathan, who stabs himself to frame up Daniel. To save Katerina and Henya's life from Nathan, Daniel surrenders himself to the police for frustrated murder, and reunites with Miguel in jail. Nathan still threatens Katerina, while Daniel is fatally stabbed by a prison mate, sending him into a coma.\n\nAfter recovering at a hospital and was released from prison, Daniel vows to stop Nathan from taking Katerina away from him. A reformed Margaret admits that Katerina and Nathan's marriage is null and void because the wedding priest's license was already expired. Daniel finds Nathan and Katerina at the airport, and Johanna tells them the truth about Nathan's fake marriage. Margaret reconciles with Henya before surrendering herself to the police for all her crimes and her alliance with Miguel. Emily and Marco finally get married in the United States, while Miguel fakes his death at the [[Jones Bridge]] by getting multiple shots from a sniper by David (under the orders of Tomas) and plunges down into the river. Margaret is finally forgiven by Emily, Marco and Daniel. Nathan tries hard to redeem himself for the better (so he can make Katerina love him again), but Tomas manipulates the whole situation by telling Nathan that Katerina and Daniel are going to be married. More confrontations ensued, Daniel admits that Nathan is the father of Katerina's child, and Katerina explains to everyone how she was raped by Nathan. Marco, Emily and Johanna talks about putting Nathan to a mental hospital, but Nathan overhears them and panics, and as he desperately kidnaps Katerina, Daniel chases after them. An all-out fistfight between Daniel and Nathan results in Katerina suffering a miscarriage. Marco and Emily commits Nathan to a [[psychiatric hospital]], while a mourning Katerina angrily blames Tomas and Nathan for the death of her unborn child. Weeks later, everyone is preparing for Daniel and Katerina's wedding, and Emily learns that the Infinity Ring that Katerina holds for Daniel is the same ring that she had with Marco in the past. Tomas gets banned after a bomb threat in the Montenegro mansion, but Margaret is given a special permit to attend the wedding. Daniel and Katerina are finally married with a grand wedding in [[Intramuros]]. At the wedding reception, Margaret announces new positions for the Montenegro Corporation, including Emily as chief operating officer and Daniel as new president of the company. Daniel and Katerina spend their honeymoon at [[San Francisco]]. Afterwards, the couple returns home with a brand new wine that will be used in the company's relaunch. Tomas' business becomes bankrupt and Miguel wants his money back, while Daniel comes up with a plan bring down Tomas. In the [[Masquerade ball]] at Emily's birthday, Daniel gives her mother a surprise gift with the merge of Montenegro Corporation and Guidotti Imports and the return of Infinity Wine to the company, and Tomas gets very enraged at the Montenegros and Katerina. However, everyone realizes that Miguel is still alive.\n\nDaniel eventually face off in a final showdown with Miguel and Tomas, who kidnaps Katerina and Emily respectively. However, Miguel fatally shoots Katerina and Daniel and the couple ends up in the hospital, but Marco arrives to rescue Emily and kills Miguel in self-defense. Katerina eventually dies at the hospital, and as Daniel mourns at her grave for so many days, Tomas blames him for his sister's death and kills him, much to the anguish of Emily and Henya. In the epilogue, the Montenegros now live together in the hacienda Alcantara, where Henya and Margaret are thinking about Daniel and Katerina being reunited in the afterlife. Emily and Marco have their own baby, named Daniel. Nathan is released from the psychiatric hospital and returns home with his family. Tomas is sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and is visited by Luisa and Johanna. Several years later, new neighbors visits the hacienda Alcantara during a [[Christmas]] gathering where the young Daniel meets the couple's daughter named Catherine. The story ends with Daniel and Katerina live happily ever after in heaven.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Coco Martin]] as Daniel Guidotti{{efn|name=Cruz}}{{efn|name=Guidotti}}{{efn|name=Montenegro}}\n* [[Julia Montes]] as Katerina Alcantara{{efn|name=Katerina}}\n* [[Dawn Zulueta]] as Emilia \"Emily\" Cardenas-Guidotti{{efn|name=Emily}}\n* [[Richard Gomez]] as Marco Montenegro\n* [[Helen Gamboa]] as Do\u00f1a Margaret Cruz-Montenegro\n* [[Susan Roces]] as Virginia \"Henya\" Cruz\n* [[Paulo Avelino]] as Nathaniel \"Nathan\" Montenegro\n* [[Melissa Ricks]] as Johanna Montenegro / Patricia Bonifacio{{efn|name=Johanna}}\n* [[Joem Bascon]] as Tomas Alcantara\n* [[Rita Avila]] and [[Eula Valdez]] as Jane Bonifacio-Montenegro / Jean \"Black Lily\" Bonifacio{{efn|name=Jane}}\n* [[Nonie Buencamino]] as Miguel Ramos\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Shamaine Centenera-Buencamino|Shamaine Buencamino]] as Luisa Alcantara\n* [[Ogie Diaz]] as Kenneth\n* Arlene Muhlach as Perla\n* [[John Medina (actor)|John Medina]] as James Ocampo\n* [[Eda Nolan]] as Lorraine Delgado\n* Ivan Morales as David Conde\n\n===Guest cast===\n* [[Richard Yap]] as Henry de Dios\n* Nanding Josef as Ernesto\n* Menggie Cobarrubias as John Bonifacio\n* Olive Isidro as Edith Bonifacio\n* Froilan Sales as Hugo Rivera\n* Lui Manansala as Laarni Peralta\n* Arvin Gison as Jonathan \"Onat\" Alcantara\n* [[Fred Payawan]] as Luis Villareal\n* [[Dino Imperial]] as Jack\n* [[Ivan Dorschner]] as Katerina's debut party guest (18 Rose)\n* Patrick Sugui as Katerina's debut party guest (18 Rose)\n* [[DM Sevilla]] as Katerina's debut party guest (18 Rose)\n* Maichel Fideles as Katerina's debut party guest\n* Shey Bustamante as Katerina's debut party guest\n* [[Tricia Santos]] as Katerina's schoolmate\n* [[Fretzie Bercede]] as Katerina's schoolmate\n* [[Manuel Chua]] as Tomas' friend\n* RJ Calipus as Tomas' friend\n* Marion dela Cruz as Tomas' friend\n* Jef-Henson Dee as Padrino\n* [[Andre Tiangco]] as Atty.
