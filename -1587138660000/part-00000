It is an [[Operating signals|operating signal]] initially developed for commercial [[radiotelegraphy|radiotelegraph]] communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially [[amateur radio]]. To distinguish the use of a Q-code transmitted as a question from the same Q-code transmitted as a statement, operators either prefixed it with the military network question marker \"{{overline|INT}}\" (dit dit dah dit dah) or suffixed it with the standard Morse question mark {{overline|UD}} (dit dit dah dah dit dit). \n\nAlthough Q-codes were created when radio used [[Morse code]] exclusively, they continued to be employed after the introduction of voice transmissions. To avoid confusion, transmitter [[call sign]]s are restricted; no country is ever issued an [[ITU prefix]] starting with \"Q\". \n\nCodes in the range QAA\u2013QNZ are reserved for aeronautical use; QOA\u2013QQZ for maritime use and QRA\u2013QUZ for all services.\n\n\"Q\" has no official meaning, but it is sometimes assigned with a word with [[mnemonic]] value, such as \"Queen's\" (e.g. QFE = Queen's Field Elevation), \"Query\", \"Question\", or \"reQuest\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_16/polar_story.html |title=Aero 16 - Polar Route Operations|first=277808-Elizabeth A. |last=Franklin |accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early developments==\nThe original Q-codes were created, ''circa'' 1909, by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[government]] as a \"list of abbreviations ... prepared for the use of British ships and coast stations licensed by the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Great Britain|first=Post Office|date=October 1909|title=Handbook for wireless telegraph operators working installations licensed by His Majesty's postmaster-general|oclc=40616664|location=London|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|at=appendix iii}}</ref>The Q-codes facilitated communication between maritime radio operators speaking different [[language]]s, so they were soon adopted internationally. A total of forty-five Q-codes appeared in the \"List of Abbreviations to be used in Radio Communications\", which was included in the Service Regulations affixed to the [[International Radiotelegraph Convention (1912)|Third International Radiotelegraph Convention in London]] (The Convention was signed on July 5, 1912, and became effective July 1, 1913.)\n\nThe following table reviews a sample of the all-services Q-codes adopted by the 1912 Convention:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"First 12 Q-codes listed in the 1912 International Radiotelegraph Convention, including meaning and sample use\"\n|-\n!

For example, QSW / QSX originally stood for, \"Shall I increase / decrease my spark frequency?\", but in the 1920s [[spark-gap transmitter]]s were gradually being banned from land stations, making that meaning obsolete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sEeaJC_y22EC&pg=PA14-IA15&dq=spark#v=onepage&q=spark&f=false|title=Contact at Sea: A History of Maritime Radio Communications|first=Peter B.|last=Schroeder|date=December 29, 1967|publisher=Ardent Media|via=Google Books}}</ref> By the 1970s, the ''Post Office Handbook for Radio Operators'' listed over a hundred Q-codes,<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook for Radio Operators |date=1975 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=0118804626 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/HandbookForRadioOperators/page/n172 155]\u2013174 |url=https://archive.org/details/HandbookForRadioOperators |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> covering a wide range of subjects including radio procedures, meteorology, radio direction finding, and search and rescue.\n\nSome Q-codes are also used in [[aviation]], in particular [[QNE]], [[QNH]] and [[Mean sea level pressure|QFE]], referring to certain [[altimeter setting]]s. These codes are used in radiotelephone conversations with [[air traffic control]] as unambiguous shorthand, where safety and efficiency are of vital importance. A subset of Q-codes is used by the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] local government for law enforcement and fire rescue communications, one of the few instances where Q-codes are used in ground voice communication.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=National Communications Magazine |url=http://bearcat1.com/radiofl.htm |title=Radio codes & signals \u2013 Florida |access-date=2010-01-30 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe QAA\u2013QNZ code range includes phrases applicable primarily to the aeronautical service,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Q%20code.htm |title=The Q-Code |accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref> as defined by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[ICAO]] |series=Procedures for Air Navigation Services (PANS) |id=Doc 8400 |title=The ICAO Q-Code}}</ref> The QOA\u2013QQZ code range is reserved for the maritime service.

The Z code adds commands and questions adapted for military radio transmissions, for example, \"ZBW 2\", which means \"change to backup frequency number 2\", and \"ZNB abc\", which means \"my checksum is abc, what is yours?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armymars.net/ArmyMARS/DigitalOps/Resources/acp131-operating-sigs.pdf |id=ACP 131(E) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119091213/http://www.armymars.net/ArmyMARS/DigitalOps/Resources/acp131-operating-sigs.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-19 |series=Communications Instructions |title=Operating Signals |date=March 1997 |quote=Chapter&nbsp;2 contains a full list of 'Q' codes}}</ref>\n\nUsed in their formal question / answer sense, the meaning of a Q-code varies depending on whether the individual Q-code is sent as a question or an answer. For example, the message \"QRP?\" means \"Shall I decrease transmitter power?\", and a reply of \"QRP\" means \"Yes, decrease your transmitter power\", whereas an unprompted statement \"QRP\" means \"Please decrease your transmitter power\". This structured use of Q-codes is fairly rare and now mainly limited to amateur radio and military [[Morse code]] (CW) traffic networks.\n\n==Breakdown by service==\n*QAA to QNZ \u2013 Assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n*QNA to QNZ \u2013 The [[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL) has also developed its own [[QN Signals]] for message handling located in this range. Even though they overlap with other signals, the ARRL determined that their exclusive use in [[National Traffic system|NTS]] nets limits confusion.\n*QOA to QQZ \u2013 For the Maritime Mobile Service.\n*QRA to QUZ \u2013 Assigned by the International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunication Sector ([[ITU-R]]).\n\n===Aeronautical Code signals (QAA\u2013QNZ; ICAO)===\n{{Main|Aeronautical Code signals}}\n\nFirst defined in ICAO publication \"Doc 6100-COM/504/1\" and in \"ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation Services, Abbreviations and Codes (PANS-ABC)\" [Doc8400-4] (4th edition 1989), the majority of the Q-codes have fallen out of common use; for example today reports such as QAU (\"I am about to jettison fuel\") and QAZ (\"I am flying in a storm\") would be voice or computerized transmissions. But several remain part of the standard [[ICAO]] radiotelephony phraseology in aviation. These are also part of [[ACP-131|ACP131]], which lists all ITU-R Q-codes, without grouping them by aeronautical/marine/general use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n!'''Question ?'''\n!'''Answer or Advice'''\n|-\n|'''QAB '''\n|May I have clearance (for ...) from ...

Most of the meanings are identical to the ITU definitions, however, they must be looked at in the context of amateur communications. For example, QSJ? asks what the charges are for sending the telegraph. Since amateur communications are without charge, this Q-code would not make sense.\n\nThe second set is the set of [[QN Signals]], used only in ARRL [[National Traffic System|NTS]] nets. These operating signals generally have no equivalent in the ACP 131 publication or ITU publications, and are specifically defined only for use in ARRL NTS nets. They are not used in casual amateur radio communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wb8ylo.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/operating-signals/|title=Operating Signals|date=December 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=FSD-218 - Field Service Form: Instructions for NTS Radiogram Messages |url=http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Public%2520Service/fsd218.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSelected Q-codes were soon adopted by [[amateur radio operator]]s. In December 1915, the [[American Radio Relay League]] began publication of a magazine titled ''[[QST]]'', named after the Q-code for \"General call to all stations\". In amateur radio, the Q-codes were originally used in Morse code transmissions to shorten lengthy phrases and were followed by a Morse code question mark ('''\u00b7\u00b7\u2014&nbsp;\u2014\u00b7\u00b7''') if the phrase was a question.\n\nQ-codes are commonly used in voice communications as shorthand nouns, verbs, and adjectives making up phrases. For example, an amateur radio operator will complain about QRM (man-made interference), or tell another operator that there is \"QSB on the signal\" (fading); \"to QSY\" is to change your operating frequency, or to break in on a conversation QSK is often used even on VHF and UHF frequencies.

For Q-code assertions or queries which only need to be acknowledged as received, the usual practice is to respond with the letter \"R\" for \"Roger\" which means \"Received correctly\". Sending an \"R\" merely means the code has been correctly received and does not necessarily mean that the receiving operator has taken any other action.\n\nFor Q-code queries that need to be answered in the affirmative, the usual practice is to respond with the letter \"C\" (Sounds like the Spanish word \"Si\"). For Q-code queries that need to be answered in the negative, the usual practice it to respond with the letter \"N\" for \"no\". For those Q-code assertions that merely need to be acknowledged as understood, the usual practice is to respond with the [[prosigns for Morse code|prosign]] {{overline|SN}} (or {{overline|VE}}) which means \"understood\".

It is an [[Operating signals|operating signal]] initially developed for commercial [[radiotelegraphy|radiotelegraph]] communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially [[amateur radio]]. To distinguish the use of a Q-code transmitted as a question from the same Q-code transmitted as a statement, operators either prefixed it with the military network question marker \"{{overline|INT}}\" (dit dit dah dit dah) or suffixed it with the standard Morse question mark {{overline|UD}} (dit dit dah dah dit dit). \n\nAlthough Q-codes were created when radio used [[Morse code]] exclusively, they continued to be employed after the introduction of voice transmissions. To avoid confusion, transmitter [[call sign]]s are restricted; no country is ever issued an [[ITU prefix]] starting with \"Q\". \n\nCodes in the range QAA\u2013QNZ are reserved for aeronautical use; QOA\u2013QQZ for maritime use and QRA\u2013QUZ for all services.\n\n\"Q\" has no official meaning, but it is sometimes assigned with a word with [[mnemonic]] value, such as \"Queen's\" (e.g. QFE = Queen's Field Elevation), \"Query\", \"Question\", or \"reQuest\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_16/polar_story.html |title=Aero 16 - Polar Route Operations|first=277808-Elizabeth A. |last=Franklin |accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early developments==\nThe original Q-codes were created, ''circa'' 1909, by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[government]] as a \"list of abbreviations ... prepared for the use of British ships and coast stations licensed by the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Great Britain|first=Post Office|date=October 1909|title=Handbook for wireless telegraph operators working installations licensed by His Majesty's postmaster-general|oclc=40616664|location=London|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|at=appendix iii}}</ref>The Q-codes facilitated communication between maritime radio operators speaking different [[language]]s, so they were soon adopted internationally.

For example, QSW / QSX originally stood for, \"Shall I increase / decrease my spark frequency?\", but in the 1920s [[spark-gap transmitter]]s were gradually being banned from land stations, making that meaning obsolete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sEeaJC_y22EC&pg=PA14-IA15&dq=spark#v=onepage&q=spark&f=false|title=Contact at Sea: A History of Maritime Radio Communications|first=Peter B.|last=Schroeder|date=December 29, 1967|publisher=Ardent Media|via=Google Books}}</ref> By the 1970s, the ''Post Office Handbook for Radio Operators'' listed over a hundred Q-codes,<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook for Radio Operators |date=1975 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=0118804626 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/HandbookForRadioOperators/page/n172 155]\u2013174 |url=https://archive.org/details/HandbookForRadioOperators |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> covering a wide range of subjects including radio procedures, meteorology, radio direction finding, and search and rescue.\n\nSome Q-codes are also used in [[aviation]], in particular [[QNE]], [[QNH]] and [[Mean sea level pressure|QFE]], referring to certain [[altimeter setting]]s. These codes are used in radiotelephone conversations with [[air traffic control]] as unambiguous shorthand, where safety and efficiency are of vital importance.

The Z code adds commands and questions adapted for military radio transmissions, for example, \"ZBW 2\", which means \"change to backup frequency number 2\", and \"ZNB abc\", which means \"my checksum is abc, what is yours?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armymars.net/ArmyMARS/DigitalOps/Resources/acp131-operating-sigs.pdf |id=ACP 131(E) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119091213/http://www.armymars.net/ArmyMARS/DigitalOps/Resources/acp131-operating-sigs.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-19 |series=Communications Instructions |title=Operating Signals |date=March 1997 |quote=Chapter&nbsp;2 contains a full list of 'Q' codes}}</ref>\n\nUsed in their formal question / answer sense, the meaning of a Q-code varies depending on whether the individual Q-code is sent as a question or an answer. For example, the message \"QRP?\" means \"Shall I decrease transmitter power?\", and a reply of \"QRP\" means \"Yes, decrease your transmitter power\", whereas an unprompted statement \"QRP\" means \"Please decrease your transmitter power\". This structured use of Q-codes is fairly rare and now mainly limited to amateur radio and military [[Morse code]] (CW) traffic networks.\n\n==Breakdown by service==\n*QAA to QNZ \u2013 Assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n*QNA to QNZ \u2013 The [[American Radio Relay League]] (ARRL) has also developed its own [[QN Signals]] for message handling located in this range.

But several remain part of the standard [[ICAO]] radiotelephony phraseology in aviation. These are also part of [[ACP-131|ACP131]], which lists all ITU-R Q-codes, without grouping them by aeronautical/marine/general use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n!'''Question ?'''\n!'''Answer or Advice'''\n|-\n|'''QAB '''\n|May I have clearance (for ...) from ...

Most of the meanings are identical to the ITU definitions, however, they must be looked at in the context of amateur communications. For example, QSJ? asks what the charges are for sending the telegraph. Since amateur communications are without charge, this Q-code would not make sense.\n\nThe second set is the set of [[QN Signals]], used only in ARRL [[National Traffic System|NTS]] nets. These operating signals generally have no equivalent in the ACP 131 publication or ITU publications, and are specifically defined only for use in ARRL NTS nets. They are not used in casual amateur radio communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wb8ylo.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/operating-signals/|title=Operating Signals|date=December 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=FSD-218 - Field Service Form: Instructions for NTS Radiogram Messages |url=http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Public%2520Service/fsd218.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSelected Q-codes were soon adopted by [[amateur radio operator]]s. In December 1915, the [[American Radio Relay League]] began publication of a magazine titled ''[[QST]]'', named after the Q-code for \"General call to all stations\". In amateur radio, the Q-codes were originally used in Morse code transmissions to shorten lengthy phrases and were followed by a Morse code question mark ('''\u00b7\u00b7\u2014&nbsp;\u2014\u00b7\u00b7''') if the phrase was a question.\n\nQ-codes are commonly used in voice communications as shorthand nouns, verbs, and adjectives making up phrases. For example, an amateur radio operator will complain about QRM (man-made interference), or tell another operator that there is \"QSB on the signal\" (fading); \"to QSY\" is to change your operating frequency, or to break in on a conversation QSK is often used even on VHF and UHF frequencies.

For Q-code assertions or queries which only need to be acknowledged as received, the usual practice is to respond with the letter \"R\" for \"Roger\" which means \"Received correctly\". Sending an \"R\" merely means the code has been correctly received and does not necessarily mean that the receiving operator has taken any other action.\n\nFor Q-code queries that need to be answered in the affirmative, the usual practice is to respond with the letter \"C\" (Sounds like the Spanish word \"Si\"). For Q-code queries that need to be answered in the negative, the usual practice it to respond with the letter \"N\" for \"no\". For those Q-code assertions that merely need to be acknowledged as understood, the usual practice is to respond with the [[prosigns for Morse code|prosign]] {{overline|SN}} (or {{overline|VE}}) which means \"understood\". On telegraph cable networks \"KK\" was often used at the end of a reply to a Q-code to mean \"OK\" or \"Acknowledged\". This practice predates amateur radio as telegraph operators in the late 19th century are known to have used it.\n\n====Informal usage====\n[[Image:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|315px|Chart of the Morse code letters and numerals.<ref name='itu-r'>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/ |title=International Morse code Recommendation ITU-R M.1677-1  |date=October 2009 |work=itu.int |publisher=International Telecommunication Union |accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref>]]\n\n'''QLF''' \u2013 \"Are you sending with your left foot?

Struck by McDiarmid's eloquent descriptions of the scenery and associated legends, the gentleman learned that McDiarmid had written a manuscript, which McDiarmid entrusted to him to be published. The preface assures the reader that visitors to Lochearnhead could confirm McDiarmid's existence and his sole authorship of the book.  It then praises the \"unparalleled sublimity\" of the book's style, which it connects with the rugged [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] landscape and offers as the reason that McDiarmid's sentences \"overleap the mounds and impediments of grammar\".<ref name=\"S&PD\">{{cite book |last=McDiarmid |first=Angus |date=1815 |title=Striking and Picturesque Delineations of the Grand, Beautiful, Wonderful, and Interesting Scenery Around Loch-Earn |publisher=John Moir |location=Edinburgh |page=viii |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2MUHAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover |access-date=30 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lochearnhead and Glen Ogle.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|[[Lochearnhead]] and [[Glen Ogle]] (the valley at left) in May 2007.]]\nThe main text is 28 pages about the region near Lochearnhead.

Struck by McDiarmid's eloquent descriptions of the scenery and associated legends, the gentleman learned that McDiarmid had written a manuscript, which McDiarmid entrusted to him to be published. The preface assures the reader that visitors to Lochearnhead could confirm McDiarmid's existence and his sole authorship of the book.  It then praises the \"unparalleled sublimity\" of the book's style, which it connects with the rugged [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] landscape and offers as the reason that McDiarmid's sentences \"overleap the mounds and impediments of grammar\".<ref name=\"S&PD\">{{cite book |last=McDiarmid |first=Angus |date=1815 |title=Striking and Picturesque Delineations of the Grand, Beautiful, Wonderful, and Interesting Scenery Around Loch-Earn |publisher=John Moir |location=Edinburgh |page=viii |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2MUHAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover |access-date=30 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lochearnhead and Glen Ogle.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|[[Lochearnhead]] and [[Glen Ogle]] (the valley at left) in May 2007.]]\nThe main text is 28 pages about the region near Lochearnhead.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]]. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219030526/http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2014/02/06/the-dreams-of-benjamin-banneker/|archivedate=2018-02-19}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302003904/http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|archivedate=March 2, 2020|url=http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|title=Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806.|work=[[Maryland Historical Society#Library|H.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.
