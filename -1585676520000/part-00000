The traditional approach in this area, which includes complications from genetics, is [[population genetics]]. Most population geneticists consider the appearance of new [[allele]]s by [[mutation]], the appearance of new [[genotype]]s by [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and changes in the frequencies of existing alleles and genotypes at a small number of [[gene]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. When [[infinitesimal]] effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, together with the assumption of [[linkage disequilibrium|linkage equilibrium]] or [[quasi-linkage equilibrium]], one derives [[quantitative genetics]]. [[Ronald Fisher]] made fundamental advances in statistics, such as [[analysis of variance]], via his work on quantitative genetics. Another important branch of population genetics that led to the extensive development of [[coalescent theory]] is [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetics]]. Phylogenetics is an area that deals with the reconstruction and analysis of phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees and networks based on inherited characteristics<ref>Charles Semple (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uR8i2qetjSAC Phylogenetics], Oxford University Press, {{isbn|978-0-19-850942-4}}</ref> Traditional population genetic models deal with alleles and genotypes, and are frequently [[stochastic]].\n\nMany population genetics models assume that population sizes are constant. Variable population sizes, often in the absence of genetic variation, are treated by the field of [[population dynamics]]. Work in this area dates back to the 19th century, and even as far as 1798 when [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] formulated the first principle of population dynamics, which later became known as the [[Malthusian growth model]]. The [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation|Lotka\u2013Volterra predator-prey equations]] are another famous example. Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: [[mathematical modelling of infectious disease|mathematical epidemiology]], the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of the spread of [[infections]] have been proposed and analyzed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.\n\nIn [[evolutionary game theory]], developed first by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], selection acts directly on inherited phenotypes, without genetic complications. This approach has been mathematically refined to produce the field of [[evolutionary invasion analysis|adaptive dynamics]].\n\n=== Mathematical biophysics ===\nThe earlier stages of mathematical biology were dominated by mathematical [[biophysics]], described as the application of mathematics in biophysics, often involving specific physical/mathematical models of biosystems and their components or compartments.\n\nThe following is a list of mathematical descriptions and their assumptions.\n\n====Deterministic processes (dynamical systems)====\nA fixed mapping between an initial state and a final state. Starting from an initial condition and moving forward in time, a deterministic process always generates the same trajectory, and no two trajectories cross in state space.\n\n*[[Difference equations|Difference equations/Maps]]&nbsp;\u2013 discrete time, continuous state space.\n*[[Ordinary differential equations]]&nbsp;\u2013 continuous time, continuous state space, no spatial derivatives.

The solution of the equations, by either analytical or numerical means, describes how the biological system behaves either over time or at [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]]. There are many different types of equations and the type of behavior that can occur is dependent on both the model and the equations used. The model often makes assumptions about the system. The equations may also make assumptions about the nature of what may occur.\n\n=== Molecular set theory ===\nMolecular set theory (MST) is a mathematical formulation of the wide-sense [[chemical kinetics]] of biomolecular reactions in terms of sets of molecules and their chemical transformations represented by set-theoretical mappings between molecular sets. It was introduced by [[Anthony Bartholomay]], and its applications were developed in mathematical biology and especially in mathematical medicine.<ref name=\"planetphysics.org\">{{cite web|url=http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/CategoryOfMolecularSets2.html|title=molecular set category|publisher=PlanetPhysics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107152607/http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/CategoryOfMolecularSets2.html|archivedate=2016-01-07|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\nIn a more general sense, MST is the theory of molecular categories defined as categories of molecular sets and their chemical transformations represented as set-theoretical mappings of molecular sets.

They emphasize the circularities that these interdependences lead to. Theoretical biologists developed several concepts to formalize this idea.\n\nFor example, abstract relational biology (ARB)<ref>[http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AbstractRelationalBiologyARB.html Abstract Relational Biology (ARB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107152607/http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AbstractRelationalBiologyARB.html |date=2016-01-07 }}</ref> is concerned with the study of general, relational models of complex biological systems, usually abstracting out specific morphological, or anatomical, structures. Some of the simplest models in ARB are the Metabolic-Replication, or '''(M,R)'''--systems introduced by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] in 1957-1958 as abstract, relational models of cellular and organismal organization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life|last=Rosen|first=Robert|date=2005-07-13|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231075657|language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Model example: the cell cycle ==\n{{Main|Cellular model}}\nThe eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.\nIt is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results.  Two research groups <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/Tyson%20Lab.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728091004/http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/Tyson%20Lab.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-07-28 |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|accessdate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cellcycle.mkt.bme.hu/|title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210210021/http://cellcycle.mkt.bme.hu/|archivedate=2012-02-10}}</ref> have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model that can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).\n\nBy means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).\n\nTo obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter\u2013Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.\n\nTo fit the parameters, the differential equations must be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.\n\n[[Image:Cell cycle bifurcation diagram.jpg|thumb|500px]] In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending on the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Lyapunov stability|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[Lyapunov stability|unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]], which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).\n\nA better representation, which handles the large number of variables and parameters, is a [[bifurcation diagram]] using [[bifurcation theory]]. The presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[Cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Societies and institutes==\n* [[National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis]]\n* [[Society for Mathematical Biology]]\n* [http://www.esmtb.org/ ESMTB: European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040109164805/http://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/istmb/ The Israeli Society for Theoretical and Mathematical Biology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911022733/http://www.necker.fr/sfbt/ Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone de Biologie Th\u00e9orique]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160118072627/http://www.biosemiotics.org/ International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]\n* [https://jnu.ac.in/scis School of Computational and Integrative Sciences], [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Biological applications of bifurcation theory]]\n* [[Biostatistics]]\n* [[Entropy and life]]\n* [[Ewens's sampling formula]]\n* [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]\n* [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease]]\n* [[Metabolic network modelling]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Morphometrics]]\n* [[Population genetics]]\n* [[Statistical genetics]]\n* [[Theoretical ecology]]\n* [[Turing pattern]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |first=L. |last=Edelstein-Keshet |title=Mathematical Models in Biology |publisher=SIAM |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-554950-6 }}\n*{{cite book |first=F. |last=Hoppensteadt |title=Mathematical Theories of Populations: Demographics, Genetics and Epidemics |publisher=SIAM |location=Philadelphia |origyear=1975 |edition=Reprinted |year=1993 |isbn=0-89871-017-0 }}\n*{{cite book |first=E. |last=Renshaw |title=Modelling Biological Populations in Space and Time |location= |publisher=C.U.P. |year=1991 |isbn=0-521-44855-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modellingbiologi0000rens }}\n*{{cite book |first=S.

The traditional approach in this area, which includes complications from genetics, is [[population genetics]]. Most population geneticists consider the appearance of new [[allele]]s by [[mutation]], the appearance of new [[genotype]]s by [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and changes in the frequencies of existing alleles and genotypes at a small number of [[gene]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. When [[infinitesimal]] effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, together with the assumption of [[linkage disequilibrium|linkage equilibrium]] or [[quasi-linkage equilibrium]], one derives [[quantitative genetics]]. [[Ronald Fisher]] made fundamental advances in statistics, such as [[analysis of variance]], via his work on quantitative genetics. Another important branch of population genetics that led to the extensive development of [[coalescent theory]] is [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetics]]. Phylogenetics is an area that deals with the reconstruction and analysis of phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees and networks based on inherited characteristics<ref>Charles Semple (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uR8i2qetjSAC Phylogenetics], Oxford University Press, {{isbn|978-0-19-850942-4}}</ref> Traditional population genetic models deal with alleles and genotypes, and are frequently [[stochastic]].\n\nMany population genetics models assume that population sizes are constant. Variable population sizes, often in the absence of genetic variation, are treated by the field of [[population dynamics]]. Work in this area dates back to the 19th century, and even as far as 1798 when [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] formulated the first principle of population dynamics, which later became known as the [[Malthusian growth model]]. The [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation|Lotka\u2013Volterra predator-prey equations]] are another famous example. Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: [[mathematical modelling of infectious disease|mathematical epidemiology]], the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of the spread of [[infections]] have been proposed and analyzed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.\n\nIn [[evolutionary game theory]], developed first by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], selection acts directly on inherited phenotypes, without genetic complications. This approach has been mathematically refined to produce the field of [[evolutionary invasion analysis|adaptive dynamics]].\n\n=== Mathematical biophysics ===\nThe earlier stages of mathematical biology were dominated by mathematical [[biophysics]], described as the application of mathematics in biophysics, often involving specific physical/mathematical models of biosystems and their components or compartments.\n\nThe following is a list of mathematical descriptions and their assumptions.\n\n====Deterministic processes (dynamical systems)====\nA fixed mapping between an initial state and a final state. Starting from an initial condition and moving forward in time, a deterministic process always generates the same trajectory, and no two trajectories cross in state space.\n\n*[[Difference equations|Difference equations/Maps]]&nbsp;\u2013 discrete time, continuous state space.\n*[[Ordinary differential equations]]&nbsp;\u2013 continuous time, continuous state space, no spatial derivatives.

The solution of the equations, by either analytical or numerical means, describes how the biological system behaves either over time or at [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]]. There are many different types of equations and the type of behavior that can occur is dependent on both the model and the equations used. The model often makes assumptions about the system. The equations may also make assumptions about the nature of what may occur.\n\n=== Molecular set theory ===\nMolecular set theory (MST) is a mathematical formulation of the wide-sense [[chemical kinetics]] of biomolecular reactions in terms of sets of molecules and their chemical transformations represented by set-theoretical mappings between molecular sets. It was introduced by [[Anthony Bartholomay]], and its applications were developed in mathematical biology and especially in mathematical medicine.<ref name=\"planetphysics.org\">{{cite web|url=http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/CategoryOfMolecularSets2.html|title=molecular set category|publisher=PlanetPhysics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107152607/http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/CategoryOfMolecularSets2.html|archivedate=2016-01-07|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\nIn a more general sense, MST is the theory of molecular categories defined as categories of molecular sets and their chemical transformations represented as set-theoretical mappings of molecular sets. The theory has also contributed to biostatistics and the formulation of clinical biochemistry problems in mathematical formulations of pathological, biochemical changes of interest to Physiology, Clinical Biochemistry and Medicine.<ref name=\"planetphysics.org\" /><ref>Representation of Uni-molecular and Multimolecular Biochemical Reactions in terms of Molecular Set Transformations http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=10770{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational biology===\nTheoretical approaches to biological organization aim to understand the interdependence between the parts of organisms. They emphasize the circularities that these interdependences lead to. Theoretical biologists developed several concepts to formalize this idea.\n\nFor example, abstract relational biology (ARB)<ref>[http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AbstractRelationalBiologyARB.html Abstract Relational Biology (ARB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107152607/http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AbstractRelationalBiologyARB.html |date=2016-01-07 }}</ref> is concerned with the study of general, relational models of complex biological systems, usually abstracting out specific morphological, or anatomical, structures. Some of the simplest models in ARB are the Metabolic-Replication, or '''(M,R)'''--systems introduced by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] in 1957-1958 as abstract, relational models of cellular and organismal organization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life|last=Rosen|first=Robert|date=2005-07-13|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231075657|language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Model example: the cell cycle ==\n{{Main|Cellular model}}\nThe eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.\nIt is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results.  Two research groups <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/Tyson%20Lab.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728091004/http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/Tyson%20Lab.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-07-28 |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|accessdate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cellcycle.mkt.bme.hu/|title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210210021/http://cellcycle.mkt.bme.hu/|archivedate=2012-02-10}}</ref> have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model that can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).\n\nBy means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).\n\nTo obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter\u2013Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.\n\nTo fit the parameters, the differential equations must be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.\n\n[[Image:Cell cycle bifurcation diagram.jpg|thumb|500px]] In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending on the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Lyapunov stability|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[Lyapunov stability|unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]], which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).\n\nA better representation, which handles the large number of variables and parameters, is a [[bifurcation diagram]] using [[bifurcation theory]]. The presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[Cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Societies and institutes==\n* [[National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis]]\n* [[Society for Mathematical Biology]]\n* [http://www.esmtb.org/ ESMTB: European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040109164805/http://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/istmb/ The Israeli Society for Theoretical and Mathematical Biology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911022733/http://www.necker.fr/sfbt/ Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone de Biologie Th\u00e9orique]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160118072627/http://www.biosemiotics.org/ International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]\n* [https://jnu.ac.in/scis School of Computational and Integrative Sciences], [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Biological applications of bifurcation theory]]\n* [[Biostatistics]]\n* [[Entropy and life]]\n* [[Ewens's sampling formula]]\n* [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]\n* [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease]]\n* [[Metabolic network modelling]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Morphometrics]]\n* [[Population genetics]]\n* [[Statistical genetics]]\n* [[Theoretical ecology]]\n* [[Turing pattern]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |first=L. |last=Edelstein-Keshet |title=Mathematical Models in Biology |publisher=SIAM |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-554950-6 }}\n*{{cite book |first=F. |last=Hoppensteadt |title=Mathematical Theories of Populations: Demographics, Genetics and Epidemics |publisher=SIAM |location=Philadelphia |origyear=1975 |edition=Reprinted |year=1993 |isbn=0-89871-017-0 }}\n*{{cite book |first=E. |last=Renshaw |title=Modelling Biological Populations in Space and Time |location= |publisher=C.U.P. |year=1991 |isbn=0-521-44855-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modellingbiologi0000rens }}\n*{{cite book |first=S.

Some researchers separate definitions of \u00a0health inequality from health disparity by preventability. Health inequalities are often categorized as being unavoidable i.e. due to age, while preventable unfair health outcomes are categorized as health inequities. These are seen as preventable because they are usually associated with income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, and more.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arcaya MC, Arcaya AL, Subramanian SV | title = Inequalities in health: definitions, concepts, and theories | journal = Global Health Action | volume = 8 | pages = 27106 | date = 2015-06-24 | pmid = 26112142 | pmc = 4481045 | doi = 10.3402/gha.v8.27106 }}</ref>\n\n== Defining race ==\n{{main|Race (human categorization)}}\n\nDefinitions of race are ambiguous due to the various paradigms used to discuss race. These definitions are a direct result of biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.<ref name=\"library.brown.edu\"/> Due to its ambiguity, terms such as  race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race. Some researchers critique this interchangeability noting that the conceptual differences between race and ethnicity are not widely agreed upon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5241582|title=Race, Ethnicity, and Racism in Medical Anthropology, 1977\u20132002 {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>\n\nBiological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe \"races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, a.k.a. use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences\".<ref name=\"raceandgenomics.ssrc.org\">{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction}}</ref> As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that \"race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference |chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race |author=Ann Morning |p=114 |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |jstor= 10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}</ref> Despite Essentialism and anti-Essentialism views, modern scientific evidence suggests there are more genetic differences within individuals belonging to the same racial groups, than between individuals belonging to different racial groups.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lewontin R | year = 1972 | title = The apportionment of human diversity | url = http://www.philbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lewontin-The-Apportionment-of-Human-Diversity.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evol Biology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 381\u2013398 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last 20 years there has been major criticisms on the once widely held view that race is biological. In response to these criticisms, researchers and social scientists have begun examining notions of race as constructed.<ref name = \"Gravlee_2008\" /> Racial groups are \"constructed\" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.<ref name=\"raceandgenomics.ssrc.org\"/> Since race is changing and often so loosely characterized on arbitrary phenotypes, and because it has no genetic basis, the only working definition we can assign it is a social construct. This is not to say race is imaginary or non-existent, it is very real and plays a role in our society; however to say that the concept of race has any scientific merit or has a scientific foundation can lead to many issues in scientific research, and it may also lead to inherent racial bias.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai J, Ucik L, Baldwin N, Hasslinger C, George P | title = Race Matters?

An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.<ref>[[Social interpretations of race]]</ref> Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture.

There are two biocultural approach models. The first approach fuses biological, environmental, and cultural data. The second approach treats biological data as primary data and culture and environmental data as secondary.\n\nThe salt sensitivity hypothesis is an example of implementing biocultural approaches in order to understand cardiovascular health disparities among African American populations. This theory, founded by Wilson and Grim, stems from the disproportional rates of salt sensitive high blood pressure seen between U.S. African American and White populations and between U.S. African American and West Africans as well. The researchers hypothesized that the patterns were in response to two events. One the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which resulted in massive death totals of Africans who were forced over, those who survived and made to the United States were more likely able to withstand the harsh conditions because they retained salt and water better. The selection continued once they were in the United States. African Americans who were able to withstand hard working conditions had better survival rates due to high water and salt retention. Second, today, because of different environmental conditions and increased salt intake with diets, water and salt retention are disadvantageous, leaving U.S. African Americans at disproportional risks because of their biological descent and culture.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Grim CE, Wilson TW |title=Salt, Slavery, and Survival: Physiological Principles Underlying the Evolutionary Hypothesis of Salt-Sensitive Hypertension in Western Hemisphere Blacks |date=1993 |journal=Pathophysiology of Hypertension in Blacks|pages=25\u201349|series=Clinical Physiology Series|publisher=Springer, New York, NY |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7577-4_2|isbn=9781461475774 }}</ref>\n\n===Bio social inheritance model===\n\nSimilar to the biocultural approach, the bio social inheritance model also looks at biological and social methods in examining health disparities.

The New York Times, published May 5, 2002</ref> The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.\n\nRace in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.<ref name=\"Collins-2004\"/>\n\nTaking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.<ref name=\"whitmarsh 9\" />\n\nThe continued use of racial categories has been criticized.

These definitions are a direct result of biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.<ref name=\"library.brown.edu\"/> Due to its ambiguity, terms such as  race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race. Some researchers critique this interchangeability noting that the conceptual differences between race and ethnicity are not widely agreed upon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5241582|title=Race, Ethnicity, and Racism in Medical Anthropology, 1977\u20132002 {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>\n\nBiological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe \"races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, a.k.a. use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences\".<ref name=\"raceandgenomics.ssrc.org\">{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction}}</ref> As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that \"race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference |chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race |author=Ann Morning |p=114 |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |jstor= 10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}</ref> Despite Essentialism and anti-Essentialism views, modern scientific evidence suggests there are more genetic differences within individuals belonging to the same racial groups, than between individuals belonging to different racial groups.<ref>Lewontin R.

In response to these criticisms, researchers and social scientists have begun examining notions of race as constructed.<ref name = \"Gravlee_2008\" /> Racial groups are \"constructed\" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.<ref name=\"raceandgenomics.ssrc.org\"/> Since race is changing and often so loosely characterized on arbitrary phenotypes, and because it has no genetic basis, the only working definition we can assign it is a social construct. This is not to say race is imaginary or non-existent, it is very real and plays a role in our society; however to say that the concept of race has any scientific merit or has a scientific foundation can lead to many issues in scientific research, and it may also lead to inherent racial bias.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai J, Ucik L, Baldwin N, Hasslinger C, George P | title = Race Matters?

An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.<ref>[[Social interpretations of race]]</ref> Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home}}</ref> The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies.

There are two biocultural approach models. The first approach fuses biological, environmental, and cultural data. The second approach treats biological data as primary data and culture and environmental data as secondary.\n\nThe salt sensitivity hypothesis is an example of implementing biocultural approaches in order to understand cardiovascular health disparities among African American populations. This theory, founded by Wilson and Grim, stems from the disproportional rates of salt sensitive high blood pressure seen between U.S. African American and White populations and between U.S. African American and West Africans as well. The researchers hypothesized that the patterns were in response to two events. One the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which resulted in massive death totals of Africans who were forced over, those who survived and made to the United States were more likely able to withstand the harsh conditions because they retained salt and water better. The selection continued once they were in the United States. African Americans who were able to withstand hard working conditions had better survival rates due to high water and salt retention. Second, today, because of different environmental conditions and increased salt intake with diets, water and salt retention are disadvantageous, leaving U.S. African Americans at disproportional risks because of their biological descent and culture.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Grim CE, Wilson TW |title=Salt, Slavery, and Survival: Physiological Principles Underlying the Evolutionary Hypothesis of Salt-Sensitive Hypertension in Western Hemisphere Blacks |date=1993 |journal=Pathophysiology of Hypertension in Blacks|pages=25\u201349|series=Clinical Physiology Series|publisher=Springer, New York, NY |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7577-4_2|isbn=9781461475774 }}</ref>\n\n===Bio social inheritance model===\n\nSimilar to the biocultural approach, the bio social inheritance model also looks at biological and social methods in examining health disparities.

Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.<ref name=\"Collins-2004\"/>\n\nTaking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.<ref name=\"whitmarsh 9\" />\n\nThe continued use of racial categories has been criticized.

She has been a main character since the series began. She is a comical character who isn't very intellectual, and she often follows her heart instead of her head, which provides humour in the show. She wears high heels and a very glossy 'Scarlet Rose' shade of lipstick as part of her receptionist uniform, but this adds to her 'ditzy' demeanour, increasing the comedic aspects of her character.\n\nAnna arrived in episode 1 from 'The Chesterton' hotel to interview for the position of Deputy Manager at Hotel Babylon. Although a likely candidate for the job, she was beaten to the post by [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie Edwards]]. Rebecca asked her to stay at Hotel Babylon as Head Receptionist, the post which Charlie gave up for Deputy Manager.\n\nAnna is aspirational. She works in the luxury hotel business because not only does she feel completely at home - it's the only way she can afford to be a part of it.\nShe's gorgeous but knows it, and as far as she's concerned it's only a matter of time before she bags a wealthy and eligible man. Her sole ambition is to marry into the lifestyle she believes she deserves. But her plans become unstuck when Anna finds herself head over heels in love and not with the wealthy entrepreneur she's always dreamed of. Anna's posh persona is as fake as her hyphenated family name, as Series 2 reveals.\n\nIn Series 2 Episode 3, it is revealed that Anna's family are not so grand after all. A grand ball is organized for guest Lady Catherine Stanwood (played by [[Kelly Brook]]). Lady Catherine was once a former work-colleague of Anna's at 'The Chesterton' hotel before Catherine married Lord Stanwood. Anna is shocked and deeply envious of Catherine's new status which forces Anna to lie and self-promote herself to \"Hotel Deputy Manager In-Waiting\" to boost her perceived status in the hotel. Later, during the ball, Anna's actual role in the hotel is revealed to Catherine which prompts Catherine to accuse Anna of being a 'fake'.  Anna's father is publicly revealed by Catherine, to be a council clerk and her mother, a school dinner lady.  In a separate scene in the same episode, Anna also privately reveals to Charlie that her real family name is only 'Thornton', not 'Thornton-Wilton', which Anna has used throughout her career to elevate her social standing.  Later, Lady Catherine and Anna are friends again. Catherine also confirms a rumour to Anna that 'The Chesterton' hotel had a staff party after Anna left the Chesterton, to celebrate Anna's departure because she was so unpopular.\n\nBefore the events of the first series, it was revealed that Anna had slept with Charlie Edwards when they worked together at 'The Chesterton' hotel, prior to Series 1. They are friends until Series 3 when they start dating. However they broke up later in Series 3.\n\nAnna is close friends with the rest of the staff in the hotel. At the end of series 3 she begins dating a surgeon; however, she rejected his proposal of marriage when she found he was using her to have children.\n\nEmma Pierson said about Anna, \"She has grown up a bit and changed a little but she is still naughty and irreverent underneath.\" \"Having had two years of getting to know each other Anna and Jackie have very much settled their differences and now get on, despite having a new female colleague on the floor (Emily).\"\n\nIn the first episode of Series 4, Anna seems to be very, very pregnant but who is the father?\nAnna finds that her colleagues are taking bets on who they think the father is and this leads to a small fall out. Just to keep them quiet Anna asks Darren, one of the waiters to pretend to be the father. The waiter gets slightly carried away and thinks that Anna is really in love with him.\nA book is published giving clues about where some emeralds are hidden in the hotel. Anna finds them and gives one of them to Tony on her departure.\nLater in the series, Anna goes into labour during the day.\nCharlie returns and is the father of her baby.\nCharlie proposes to her.\nAnna gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Scarlett Rose - named after her lipstick.\nAnna and Charlie leave with Scarlett with the rest of the jewels hidden under her sleeve.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before = [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie Edwards]]| title = Head Receptionist of Hotel Babylon | years = 2006\u20132009| after = [[#Ben Trueman|Ben Trueman]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Charlie Edwards====\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series =Hotel Babylon\n|name= Charlie Edwards\n|portrayer=[[Max Beesley]]\n|years= 2006\u20132008, 2009\n|first= Episode 1.01\n|last= Episode 4.03\n|occupation= Former General Manager\n|spouse= [[#Anna Thornton-Wilton|Anna Thornton-Wilton]]\n<small>(2009-)</small>\n|children= Scarlett Rose Edwards\n|romances= [[Rebecca Mitchell]]\n[[Jackie Clunes]]\n}}\n\n'''Charles \"Charlie\" Edwards''' is played by [[Max Beesley]]. he first appeared in Series 1, Episode 1 and last appeared in Series 4, Episode 3 to propose to Anna. After the departure of Rebecca Mitchell ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), Charlie became manager. Beesley also narrates the series mostly informing the viewers of hotel events and activities (e.g. the hotel rating system and hotel thefts). He has also been in prison for a year<ref>''Hotel Babylon DVD, Series 1, Episode 8''</ref>\n\nNot a lot of his [[past]] is mentioned in the show. He has worked in other [[hotel]]s, such as the Chesterton. The [[BBC]] character description describes his past as \"complex\".<ref>''http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/hotelbabylon/characters/charlie_edwards_person_page.shtml, Correct as of 7th March 08''</ref> Charlie also has a brother, Dan, who appears in an episode of the second series (played by [[Chris Coghill]]). He is indicated to be considerably less successful than Charlie and to have got on the wrong side of the law several times.\n\nEdwards spent [[Year|12 months]] in [[prison]] after being sentenced for 18 months. He informed guest \"Bones\" or Mr Wiltshire (full name not mentioned) of his sentence. This was because of [[fraud]]. He did not mention this on his application form and therefore nearly got fired. Several times, Charlie uses skills that he might've picked up within the prison system, such as criminal knowledge or fighting ability (shown during an episode in the second series, where he manages to subdue a staff member holding a guest hostage with a swift and accurate punch).\n\nDuring the first series, Edwards was dating Jackie. They reserved rooms to spend the night. Their relationship was kept discreet at the start. Charlie kissed Rebecca at the staff Christmas party in series two. They arranged to have dinner soon after, but due to complications involving Charlie's younger brother, never did. They eventually agreed to keep their relationship professional, though Rebecca kissed him goodbye in the series two finale. Charlie and Anna dated in series 3, but split up just before Charlie left.\n\nCharlie comes under a lot of pressure when he replaces [[Rebecca Mitchell|Rebecca]] as the General Manager of Hotel Babylon. He receives an email that informs that the Hotel's profits are down by a lot and is then unable to pay the cleaners due to a mix up with wages. He is forced to take out a loan with a friend from when he was in prison to pay the cleaners however, his friend wants the money back sooner than Charlie can get it back. Charlie is called up to a room by Jackie who has accidentally killed a thug who was stealing from cleaners. Charlie realises the thug was taking the money to pay back Charlie's debt and so helps Jackie, with the aid of Tanja, dispose of the body. Charlie then leaves when his friend, ''Hutch'', makes him an offer to travel with him.\n\nMax Beesley said about Charlie, \"It's a bit different playing the General Manager now because there is more responsibility for Charlie. Even though he is not running around like a headless chicken, like he was in the first series, he has to be more centred because there is a lot of pressure on him.\"\n\nHe is the father to Anna's daughter, Scarlett Rose. He has moved to New York with Anna and Scarlett.\n{{clear}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before = [[#Rebecca Mitchell|Rebecca Mitchell]]| title = [[General Manager]] of Hotel Babylon | years = 2007\u20132008| after = [[#Jack Harrison|Jack Harrison]]}}\n\n{{succession box | before = Unknown| title = Deputy Manager of Hotel Babylon | years = 2006\u20132007| after = [[#Jack Harrison|Jack Harrison]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n====Jack Harrison====\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series =Hotel Babylon\n|name= Jack Harrison\n|portrayer=[[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]]\n|years= 2008\n|first= Episode 3.04\n|last= Episode 3.08\n|occupation= Former General Manager\n}}\n\nJack Harrison is played by [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]].

She often looks after the cleaners and refers to them as \"her girls\". She has a friendly relationship with most of the other staff. In series 1, she has somewhat of a rivalry with Anna.\n\nJackie left after an accident left a thug dead in the hotel. She confronted the thug in a room after he stole from the cleaners due to a debt Charlie had with his client. The thug attacked Jackie, prompting her to run into the bathroom and lock the door. Jackie sprayed shampoo on the floor and grabbed an ornament to use as a weapon. The thug broke into the bathroom and walked towards Jackie, however slipped on the shampoo and hit his head on the edge of the bath, which killed him instantly.

She was the General Manager of Hotel Babylon until she resigned, she was generally quite strict with staff but seemed to have good relationship with them.\n\nDuring the first series Rebecca has a troubled marriage and often sleeps in the hotel when she is left at home alone. Rebecca's marriage does recover; however, she does divorce her husband eventually and in the second series finds out her now ex-husband is in a romantic relationship with a friend of hers.\n\nRebecca is usually quite strict with staff and often got annoyed with [[#Anna Thornton-Wilton|Anna]] for being late for work on numerous occasions in the first series. In the second series she has a romantic relationship with [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie]]. However she becomes suspicious of him when she sees him with another woman and it is presumed they have split up since she left.\n\nRebecca left at the end of Series 2. After the hotel was nearly taken over by hotel tycoon Donovan Credo, Rebecca was forced to lay off Jackie, James, Ben, Gino and Anna, before revealing to Tony that he and Charlie have been selected to stay. Tony's reaction to this prompts Rebecca to take action to call off the deal, preventing Credo buying out and gutting Hotel Babylon. This one false move causes Rebecca to lose the trust of her staff. On leaving her office, Rebecca tells Charlie to \"make himself comfortable\". When she has left, he sits down and reads an email on the screen that names him as Hotel Babylon's new General Manager.

Tanja was attacked because when she entered the Junk Dogs' room, she saw the woman sniffing cocaine. The lady was furious at Tanja and hit her, leaving several bruises on Tanja's face. While Tanja was struggling, she kept on saying \"Dosta, dosta! (Enough, Enough!)\"\n\nIn series 2 (episode 2) she is caught up with her horrific past in Croatia during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. A guest named [[#Michael Dovi\u0107|Michael Dovi\u0107]], an esteemed construction entrepreneur and family man from Croatia checks in. Tanja remembers his voice from the war during which he killed her friends and neighbours. He was then known as Dragan Milandrokovi\u0107. She confides to [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie]], but he thinks that she's probably mistaken because of her trauma. Disappointed about the hotel management's attitude towards her problem, she takes matters into her own hands desperate to prove she's right and to make the [[mercenary]] pay for his misdeeds.\n\nCharlie looks up Milandrokovi\u0107's name on the Internet and finds a bunch of horrible and notorious articles about him. About Dovi\u0107, on the other hand, he doesn't find anything incriminating. In fact, Dovi\u0107 even set up an orphanage for children with parents killed in the civil war.

She has been a main character since the series began. She is a comical character who isn't very intellectual, and she often follows her heart instead of her head, which provides humour in the show. She wears high heels and a very glossy 'Scarlet Rose' shade of lipstick as part of her receptionist uniform, but this adds to her 'ditzy' demeanour, increasing the comedic aspects of her character.\n\nAnna arrived in episode 1 from 'The Chesterton' hotel to interview for the position of Deputy Manager at Hotel Babylon.  Although a likely candidate for the job, she was beaten to the post by [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie Edwards]]. Rebecca asked her to stay at Hotel Babylon as Head Receptionist, the post which Charlie gave up for Deputy Manager.\n\nAnna is aspirational. She works in the luxury hotel business because not only does she feel completely at home - it's the only way she can afford to be a part of it.\nShe's gorgeous but knows it, and as far as she's concerned it's only a matter of time before she bags a wealthy and eligible man. Her sole ambition is to marry into the lifestyle she believes she deserves. But her plans become unstuck when Anna finds herself head over heels in love and not with the wealthy entrepreneur she's always dreamed of.  Anna's posh persona is as fake as her hyphenated family name, as Series 2 reveals.\n\nIn Series 2 Episode 3, it is revealed that Anna's family are not so grand after all.  A grand ball is organized for guest Lady Catherine Stanwood (played by [[Kelly Brook]]).  Lady Catherine was once a former work-colleague of Anna's at 'The Chesterton' hotel before Catherine married Lord Stanwood.  Anna is shocked and deeply envious of Catherine's new status which forces Anna to lie and self-promote herself to \"Hotel Deputy Manager In-Waiting\" to boost her perceived status in the hotel.  Later, during the ball, Anna's actual role in the hotel is revealed to Catherine which prompts Catherine to accuse Anna of being a 'fake'.  Anna's father is publicly revealed by Catherine, to be a council clerk and her mother, a school dinner lady.  In a separate scene in the same episode, Anna also privately reveals to Charlie that her real family name is only 'Thornton', not 'Thornton-Wilton', which Anna has used throughout her career to elevate her social standing.  Later, Lady Catherine and Anna are friends again.  Catherine also confirms a rumour to Anna that 'The Chesterton' hotel had a staff party after Anna left the Chesterton, to celebrate Anna's departure because she was so unpopular.\n\nBefore the events of the first series, it was revealed that Anna had slept with Charlie Edwards when they worked together at 'The Chesterton' hotel, prior to Series 1. They are friends until Series 3 when they start dating. However they broke up later in Series 3.\n\nAnna is close friends with the rest of the staff in the hotel. At the end of series 3 she begins dating a surgeon; however, she rejected his proposal of marriage when she found he was using her to have children.\n\nEmma Pierson said about Anna, \"She has grown up a bit and changed a little but she is still naughty and irreverent underneath.\" \"Having had two years of getting to know each other Anna and Jackie have very much settled their differences and now get on, despite having a new female colleague on the floor (Emily).\"\n\nIn the first episode of Series 4, Anna seems to be very, very pregnant but who is the father?\nAnna finds that her colleagues are taking bets on who they think the father is and this leads to a small fall out. Just to keep them quiet Anna asks Darren, one of the waiters to pretend to be the father. The waiter gets slightly carried away and thinks that Anna is really in love with him.\nA book is published giving clues about where some emeralds are hidden in the hotel. Anna finds them and gives one of them to Tony on her departure.\nLater in the series, Anna goes into labour during the day.\nCharlie returns and is the father of her baby.\nCharlie proposes to her.\nAnna gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Scarlett Rose - named after her lipstick.\nAnna and Charlie leave with Scarlett with the rest of the jewels hidden under her sleeve.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before = [[#Charlie Edwards|Charlie Edwards]]| title = Head Receptionist of Hotel Babylon | years = 2006\u20132009| after = [[#Ben Trueman|Ben Trueman]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Charlie Edwards====\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series =Hotel Babylon\n|name= Charlie Edwards\n|portrayer=[[Max Beesley]]\n|years= 2006\u20132008, 2009\n|first= Episode 1.01\n|last= Episode 4.03\n|occupation= Former General Manager\n|spouse= [[#Anna Thornton-Wilton|Anna Thornton-Wilton]]\n<small>(2009-)</small>\n|children= Scarlett Rose Edwards\n|romances= [[Rebecca Mitchell]]\n[[Jackie Clunes]]\n}}\n\n'''Charles \"Charlie\" Edwards''' is played by [[Max Beesley]]. he first appeared in Series 1, Episode 1 and last appeared in Series 4, Episode 3 to propose to Anna.

He is indicated to be considerably less successful than Charlie and to have got on the wrong side of the law several times.\n\nEdwards spent [[Year|12 months]] in [[prison]] after being sentenced for 18 months. He informed guest \"Bones\" or Mr Wiltshire (full name not mentioned) of his sentence. This was because of [[fraud]]. He did not mention this on his application form and therefore nearly got fired. Several times, Charlie uses skills that he might've picked up within the prison system, such as criminal knowledge or fighting ability (shown during an episode in the second series, where he manages to subdue a staff member holding a guest hostage with a swift and accurate punch).\n\nDuring the first series, Edwards was dating Jackie. They reserved rooms to spend the night. Their relationship was kept discreet at the start. Charlie kissed Rebecca at the staff Christmas party in series two. They arranged to have dinner soon after, but due to complications involving Charlie's younger brother, never did. They eventually agreed to keep their relationship professional, though Rebecca kissed him goodbye in the series two finale. Charlie and Anna dated in series 3, but split up just before Charlie left.\n\nCharlie comes under a lot of pressure when he replaces [[Rebecca Mitchell|Rebecca]] as the General Manager of Hotel Babylon. He receives an email that informs that the Hotel's profits are down by a lot and is then unable to pay the cleaners due to a mix up with wages. He is forced to take out a loan with a friend from when he was in prison to pay the cleaners however, his friend wants the money back sooner than Charlie can get it back. Charlie is called up to a room by Jackie who has accidentally killed a thug who was stealing from cleaners.

PreCure#Characters|Mana]]  receives a wedding dress from her mother, which was previously worn by her late grandmother and her mother. Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

Back in the present, Miyuki, Akane, Yayoi, Nao, and Reika all go to a book expo where they come across a quaint little movie theater. Whilst watching the movie, a strange girl named Nico suddenly pops out of the screen, pursued by [[Journey to the West|Kingaku and Gingaku]]. After the Cures manage to beat the two monsters, Nico takes them to the World of Picture Books, where characters from various fairy tales live. There, the girls are given the opportunity to live out roles of their favourite book protagonists; [[Cinderella]], [[Issun-b\u014dshi]], [[Sun Wukong]], [[Urashima Tar\u014d]] and [[Momotar\u014d]]. Things soon start turning weird, however, when the true protagonists wind up in each other's stories. These heroes are soon possessed by a dark force, causing them to show resentment towards the girls and attack them, wanting a world where stories have no endings. With the assistance of the stories's antagonists, the Cures fight to try and revert the heroes to normal. They soon learn the culprit is Nico, who holds resentment towards Miyuki for forgetting her promise to finish the story she lived in. Chasing Nico to the world of her story, Miyuki explains that in her book, Nico was a girl who brought smiles to others but was kidnapped by a dark force, at which point the ending was unknown. Miyuki had attempted to draw the rest of her story but gave up because she couldn't draw very well at the time. After some encouragement from Akane and the others, Miyuki becomes determined to make up with Nico and together they head towards the castle where she was captured. As Nico's hatred is fuelled by the Demon Lord that captured her, the girls fight off the fairytale heroes so Miyuki can try and reach Nico. Backed up by the support of her friends, who will never hate her despite their injuries, Miyuki conveys her feelings of gratitude to Nico for helping her learn to smile. Just then, the Demon Lord ensnares Nico, wanting to use the power of her hatred to take over the world. As she and the other's struggle against his attacks, Nico realises her true feelings which restores the lost pages of her book.

PreCure#Characters|Mana]]  receives a wedding dress from her mother, which was previously worn by her late grandmother and her mother. Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

When the angry customer threatens to drop a poisonous spider on Henry's face, Captain Man is forced to lock himself in a cage. Meanwhile, Jasper shows up at Henry's house looking for Henry, where Mr. and Mrs. Hart are getting massages. When he discovers Henry is in danger, he runs off to rescue him.

When Henry and the rest of the hostages are freed, Jasper mentions how Henry doesn't need to thank him because they are best friends, causing Henry to feel bad for being jealous. To make up for it, Henry purchases the same poisonous spider that the angry customer threatened to drop onto Henry as an apology because Jasper saw it at the store and really wanted, but he could not afford it as it cost $150.\n\n''Guest stars'': Jeffrey Nichols Brown as Mr. Hart, Kelly Sullivan as Mrs. Hart, Carrie Barrett as Mary Gaperman, Jill Benjamin as Miss Shapen, [[Zach Callison]] as Chet, Joe Kaprielian as Sidney, Matthew Zhang as Oliver, Winston Story as Trent Overunder, Toby Wilson as Dirk\n\n''Absent'': Ella Anderson as Piper Hart\n| LineColor       = 87CEEB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 34\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Christmas Danger\n| DirectedBy      = Steve Hoefer\n| WrittenBy       = Dan Schneider & Christopher J.

He takes the note back to the Man Cave, where Schwoz tries to identify any DNA that could find the creator of the note; however, nothing is found. Meanwhile, Piper tries to send back a spray tan gun when she believes she was sent the wrong item and later decides to operate a tanning salon from home. When Henry and Charlotte arrive home, Henry heads to his room where he finds Jasper waiting for him. Shocked, Henry tries to explain, but is unable to speak, assuming that Jasper knows he's Kid Danger. Downstairs, Piper tells Charlotte that Jasper told her his secret. Charlotte asks what he told her and Piper says that Henry had promised to see Galaxy Wars 10 on Saturday with Jasper, but his mom wanted to see it on opening night, which was Wednesday, so Henry had gone with her. Meanwhile, Henry's father is arrested on the misunderstanding that he was running an illegal tanning operation. Frazzled by the misunderstanding, Charlotte rushes to Henry's room to tell him that Jasper doesn't know his secret identity; however, it's too late as Henry has revealed to Jasper that he's Kid Danger. Jasper faints in excitement, and Henry contacts Captain Man and asks him to come to his house. When Captain Man gets there, they get into an argument about Henry's oath to never tell anyone he's Kid Danger. Afterward, Captain Man decides they have to erase Jasper's memory\u2014including memories of his best friend\u2014to prevent any more exposure. Henry contemplates and asks if he can spend a few minutes with Jasper before his memory is wiped. He and Jasper relapse on their past, with Jasper saying he is proud of Henry. Emotional by this and not willing to lose his best friend, Henry eventually resists wiping Jasper's memory and begs Captain Man not to. He relents, but finally agrees and takes Jasper under his wing.\n\n''Guest stars'': Kelly Sullivan as Mrs. Hart, Jeffrey Nichols Brown as Mr. Hart, Michael D.
