The camera crew accompanying the team had seen the dropped passport, but could not tell Kaylani or Lisa or otherwise act on it and instead informed the producers of the situation. The producers prepared to conduct an impromptu elimination and host Phil Keoghan rushed to the airport. The passport was found by two bystanders who had previously helped another team at the gas station.

The person on the other end gave the racer one of [[Confucius]]'s proverbs: \"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure.\" Without writing it down, they had to repeat the proverb verbatim to a temple monk. Once they got the proverb right, they received their next clue. If they were incorrect, they had to call the number again and make another attempt.\n\nThe Hazard required Kaylani & Lisa to travel to the [[Core Pacific City]] Mall, where one of them had to perform an indoor [[bungee jump]] before they could continue racing.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the Starting Line, teams had to search through several hundred [[oil-paper umbrella]]s for one that had the correct set of letters (\"TAI\") printed on it. When combined twice with their clue of six other letters (\"WANPEI\"), it revealed the name of their first destination: Taipei, Taiwan. Once they presented Phil with the correct umbrella, he would give them keys to one of 11 [[Ford Explorer]]s parked outside the temple. The last team to complete the task was penalized with the [[The Amazing Race#Hazard|Hazard]].\n**The first eight teams to arrive at the airport were booked on an earlier flight from Los Angeles to Taipei with the remaining three teams booked on a second flight on another airline that departed twenty minutes later.\n*At Ximending Commercial District, teams were told to \"look up\" for their next clue and were left to figure out that their clue was displayed on an [[Digital billboard|electronic billboard]] at Jun Plaza: red and yellow balloons that revealed [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|\u53f0\u5317\u5b54\u5edf}} ([[Taipei Confucius Temple]]).\n*At Dajia Riverside Park, teams joined a [[dragon boat]] team.

Once they located them, team members had to scale up a bamboo ladder to the top before delivering them to the chieftain in exchange for their next clue.\n\nThe first Detour was a choice between Shake Your Money Maker or Be a Ticket Taker, both of which took place back in the city of Yogyakarta. In Shake Your Money Maker, teams had to dress up in costumes with one team member dancing in the streets while the other played a [[gamelan]] in order earn [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]] 30,000 (US$3.40).

A small sign at the orphanage also directed teams to donate ''all'' of the money in their possession. Teams that did not donate all of their money were not allowed to check in at the Pit Stop until they doubled back and donated it.\n*At the orphanage, teams received a [[coat of arms]] from the children and had to figure out that it belonged to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultan]] and that the Pit Stop was at his palace: [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat]].\n\n===Leg 3 (Indonesia)===\n[[File:BorobudurTemple.JPG|thumb|The iconic [[Borobudur]], the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in the world, served as both the site of this leg's Roadblock and the Pit Stop.]]\n'''Airdate''': October 9, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|bicycle}} Yogyakarta ([[Fort Vredeburg Museum|Fort Vredeburg]])\n*Salakmalang Village ([[Sundanese cuisine#Sundanese restaurant|Lesehan Restaurant]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Rice Field|Grass Fed}}\n*[[Magelang]] ([[Borobudur]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's prepared to follow the path to Buddha?}} {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|3}}\n\nIn this leg's Detour, teams chose between Rice Field and Grass Fed.

Once complete, they used a kayak to take the nursery and several coral fragments out to a buoy where they had to set the nursery on the ocean floor, then set the coral fragments into the nursery. Once complete, a marine biologist gave them their next clue. In Beach Preparation, teams had to set up a series of twenty beach chairs and ten umbrellas marked with a specific symbol given in their clue.

In All Sewn Up, teams went to the White Horse De-Sign Tailor Shop in the old market and picked a customer. They then used manual [[sewing machine]]s to finish the customer's suit to obtain their next clue. In Not Grown Up, teams traveled to Lilongwe LEA School, where they had to use materials provided (cardboard boxes, nails, string, and bottle caps) to build two toy [[Semi-trailer truck|trucks]].

They had to unload two boxes of cabbage, two bundles of sugar cane, two bundles of brooms, one chair, one fan, and eight passengers, who expected to stay dry, before receiving their clue from the boat's porter.\n\n===Leg 8 (Malawi \u2192 Denmark)===\n[[File:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen 2.jpg|thumb|After arriving in [[Copenhagen]], teams had to climb to the top of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]]'s tower to search for their next clue.]]\n'''Airdate''': November 13, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Lilongwe (Lilongwe International Airport) to [[Copenhagen]], '''[[Denmark]]''' {{flagicon|DEN}} ([[Copenhagen Airport]])\n*Copenhagen ([[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]])\n*[[Hiller\u00f8d]] ([[Frederiksborg Castle]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to take a few steps back in time?}}\n*[[Kongens Lyngby]] ([[Frilandsmuseet]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|All Hopped Up|All Churned Out}}\n*Kongens Lyngby (Karlstrup Windmill) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|double=yes|Ernie & Cindy|Bill & Cathi|Bill & Cathi|Laurence & Zac}}\n*Copenhagen ([[Larsens Plads]] \u2013 ''Havet'' Ship) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|8}}\n\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to dress in period costume and learn a complex three-part dance from an instructor. Once the Countess was pleased with their dance, they received their next clue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between All Hopped Up and All Churned Out. In All Hopped Up, teams had to lay out a proper [[rabbit show jumping]] course. They then had to pick a rabbit and each team member ran it through the course without knocking over any of the obstacles. Once complete, the animal handler gave teams their next clue. In All Churned Out, teams had to make six sticks of [[butter]] by using a traditional [[butter churn]] to churn fresh cream, then stamp out the sticks using a special mold. When the [[Milkmaid|dairymaid]] approved of their work, teams would receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*After arriving in [[Copenhagen]], teams had to choose a marked [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]] and drive to the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]]. After climbing to the top of the Church of Our Saviour, teams had to search for two clues on the top of the tower. The first was a flag on the tower that said \"''{{lang|da|Borg Slot}}''\" and the other was a banner on a nearby building that said \"''{{lang|da|Frederiks}}''\". These led teams to their next location: [[Frederiksborg Castle]] in [[Hiller\u00f8d]].\n\n===Leg 9 (Denmark \u2192 Germany \u2192 Belgium)===\n[[File:Legoland Billund - Pirate Carousel.jpg|thumb|Teams visited [[Legoland Billund Resort|Legoland Billund]] where they rode the Pirate Carousel [[teacups]] while building their next clue out of [[Lego]] bricks.]]\n'''Airdate''': November 20, 2011\n*Copenhagen ([[H.

If they failed, they had to go back to the statue before returning to the theater to recite the poem again.\n\nAt Concert Noble, teams had to compete in a [[bodybuilding]] competition in honor of [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], known as \"The Muscles from Brussels\". Racers had to put on [[bikini]]s, cover their bodies in posing oil, and then learn a series of bodybuilding poses. They then used the poses in a routine performed in front of three judges for a score of twelve points. This task was originally planned as a Bodybuilding Pose Detour option and was shown as a miscellaneous task, leaving the other Detour option unknown to viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/17/exclusive-the-amazing-race-its-speedo-time-photos/|title=EXCLUSIVE: &#039;The Amazing Race&#039; Strips Down to Speedos for a Bodybuilding Challenge|accessdate=2011-11-21|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Additional task\n*At Legoland Billund, teams had to find the Pirate Carousel (a [[teacups]] ride), where they received a box containing a puzzle made of [[Lego]] bricks. While on the ride, they had to assemble the puzzle to reveal their next destination: the [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. Teams could work on the puzzle only while the ride was in motion and had to raise their hands when the ride stopped.\n\n===Leg 10 (Belgium)===\n[[File:Laeken Atomium 06.jpg|thumb|right|Teams ended their second leg in [[Belgium]] at the [[Atomium]], a famous landmark in the capital [[Brussels]].]]\n'''Airdate''': November 27, 2011\n*[[Lommel]] ([[Lommel Proving Grounds|Ford Proving Grounds]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to play with the ponies?}}\n*[[Ghent]] ([[Execution Bridge (Ghent)|Hoofdbrug]]) \n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Water or Waffle}} Ghent (Hoefslagstraatje and [[Lys (river)|Leie River]] ''or'' [[Dulle Griet]])\n*[[Geraardsbergen]] ([[Muur van Geraardsbergen]])\n*[[Beersel]] (Steenweg op Ukkel 75 ''or'' Stoofstraat 52)\n*Brussels ([[Atomium]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|10}}\n\nFor this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to test drive a [[Ford Mustang]]. They first had to accelerate to {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}} and then brake at a designated spot. They then had to navigate a [[Autocross|slalom]] course within sixteen seconds without hitting a cone and stopping inside a marked spot. Lastly, they finished the test drive by performing two victory [[Doughnut (driving)|doughnuts]] before they received their next clue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between Water and Waffle. In Water, teams had to use provided materials ([[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], rope, and wood) to build a raft to search the [[Lys (river)|Leie River]] for the two halves of their next clue. In Waffle, teams had to build a waffle stand and then bake and decorate eighteen [[Belgian waffle]]s to the chef's satisfaction before receiving their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the start of the leg, teams had to choose a marked [[Ford Fiesta#Sixth generation (2009\u20132019)|Ford Fiesta]] and drive themselves to [[Lommel Proving Grounds|Ford Proving Grounds]] in [[Lommel]] to get their next clue.\n*At Muur van Geraardsbergen, teams released a flock of [[homing pigeon]]s and then were given an address where the pigeons were flying. Once there, teams could retrieve their next clue from one of the pigeons.\n*The clue teams obtained from the pigeon was simply a picture of the [[Atomium]], which teams had to figure out in order to find the Pit Stop for this leg.\n\n===Leg 11 (Belgium \u2192 Netherlands \u2192 Panama)===\n[[File:Torre de la Catedral - Flickr - Chito.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]] in [[Panama City]] served as the Pit Stop on the penultimate leg of the Race.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 4, 2011\n*Brussels (Rue de l'\u00c9tuve \u2013 ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' Mural)\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Brussels (Brussels-South Railway Station) to [[Haarlemmermeer]], '''[[Netherlands]]''' {{flagicon|NED}} ([[Schiphol Airport railway station|Schiphol Airport Railway Station]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Amsterdam metropolitan area|Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]) to [[Panama City]], '''[[Panama]]''' {{flagicon|PAN}} ([[Tocumen International Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} [[Chagres National Park]] (Puerto El Corotu to Parara Puru) (Overnight Rest)\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} Chagres National Park (Parara Puru to Puerto El Corotu)\n*Panama City ([[San Francisco, Panam\u00e1|San Francisco]] \u2013 San Francisco Bay Towers) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to walk on rarefied air?}}\n*Panama City ([[Casco Viejo, Panama|Casco Viejo]] ([[Casco Viejo, Panama#Main sights|Plaza de Francia]] \u2013 [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] Statue))\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Filet|Sole}} Panama City (El Mercado de Mariscos ''or'' Salsipuedes Market)\n*Panama City ([[Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary (Panama City)|Cathedral Square]])\n*Panama City ([[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|11}}\n\nFor this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to cross a [[tightrope]] between the San Francisco Bay Towers, 35 stories high and {{convert|65|ft|m}} across. The racer picked up their clue on the other tower and then made the trip back to the first tower before they could continue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between Filet and Sole. In Filet, teams traveled to Panama's largest [[fish market]], El Mercado de Mariscos, where they had to deliver fish to different marked stalls throughout the market. Each stall only accepted a certain kind of fish up to a certain weight. Once they were done with their deliveries, the [[fishmonger]] gave them their next clue. In Sole, teams traveled to the Salsipuedes Market where they had to find a [[sandals]] stall and use one piece of leather each to make the sole and strapping for a pair of sandals for a customer. Once the [[Shoemaker|cobbler]] was satisfied, teams received their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*Before leaving Brussels, teams had to dress up as the two bumbling [[Thomson and Thompson|detective characters]] from the popular Belgian ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comics, and figure out one of the three names (\"Thomson and Thompson\", \"Dupond and Dupont\", or \"Johnson and Johnston\") by which the characters are known in Belgium. Then, using a photo given to them with the clue, teams had to find a man dressed as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] standing in front of a Tintin mural and tell him any one of the name variations of the characters they were dressed as in order to receive their next clue.\n*At Parara Puru, teams signed up for one of four times the next morning within 15-minute intervals starting at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to receive a temporary [[tattoo]] that would reveal their next location: the San Francisco Bay Towers in Panama City.\n*After the Roadblock, teams were given a riddle to search for a man underneath a rooster, directing them to the statue of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] in Plaza de Francia.\n*At Cathedral Square, teams had to find a group of ''[[tamborito]]'' dancers wearing ''[[pollera]]'' dresses and had to find the location of the Pit Stop, [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]], which was etched on the dancers' necklaces and written on one dancer's dress.\n\n===Leg 12 (Panama \u2192 United States)===\n[[File:Atlanta Swan House.jpg|thumb|[[Atlanta]]'s historic [[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]] was the Finish Line for the 19th ''Amazing Race''.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 11, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Panama City (Tocumen International Airport) to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] {{flagicon|Georgia (U.S. state)}}, '''United States''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]])\n*Atlanta ([[Berkshire Hathaway#Flight services|FlightSafety International]])\n*Atlanta ([[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|Margaret Mitchell House]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who gives a damn?}}\n*Atlanta ([[Turner Field]])\n*Atlanta ([[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop}}\n\nThe final Roadblock required one team member to type out the team's next clue using a [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington 3]] [[typewriter]] to duplicate an example message. The duplicate had to be perfectly straight and neat with no mistakes. Additionally, the typewriters used for the task did not have a key for the number <tt>1</tt>; racers were left to figure out that they had to use the key for the lower-case letter <tt>l</tt> as a substitute.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At FlightSafety International, teams had to pick a [[flight instructor]], who taught them how to operate a [[Learjet]] [[flight simulator]]. They then had to successfully complete a simulated landing at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport from an altitude of {{convert|2500|ft}} in order to obtain the next clue.\n*The clue from FlightSafety International instructed teams to \"find the former residence known as 'The Dump'\", leaving them to figure out that this was a reference to the [[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|home]] of [[Margaret Mitchell]], author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n*After completing the Roadblock, teams had to deduce that the series of three numbers on the clue were a homage to [[Hank Aaron]]: 44 (his [[uniform number]]), 715 (the number of home runs he hit to break the [[List of lifetime home run leaders in Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball home run record]]) and 74 (the [[1974 in baseball|year]] in which he broke the record). From this knowledge, teams had to figure out that they had to go to [[Turner Field]].\n*At Turner Field, teams had to use rock climbing gear to map out the ''Race'' course, excluding Germany and the Netherlands, from start to finish by looping a rope through a series of [[carabiner]]s, each representing a specific country, on a large vertical map. One team member worked on the map while his or her teammate gave help from the ground. Teams were not allowed to use notes while working on the task and the countries on the map were unlabeled. Once the map was looped correctly, teams received their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| #\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Airdate\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Episode\n!

She and teammate Lisa returned to the station to search for the passport but could not find it and opted to proceed to the airport in the hope that another racer had picked it up. The camera crew accompanying the team had seen the dropped passport, but could not tell Kaylani or Lisa or otherwise act on it and instead informed the producers of the situation. The producers prepared to conduct an impromptu elimination and host Phil Keoghan rushed to the airport. The passport was found by two bystanders who had previously helped another team at the gas station. After posting about the incident on [[Twitter]], a fan of the show advised them to take the passport to the airport, and they were able to return it to Kaylani before her scheduled flight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/twitters-amazing-race-assist/?scp=1&sq=amazing%20race&st=cse | title = Twitter's 'Amazing Race' Assist | first = Brian | last = Stelter | date = 2011-09-26 | accessdate = 2011-09-26 | work = [[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (American TV series) contestants}}\n[[File:TAR19 racers.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the contestants of the 19th season at the season finale \"TARCon\" event in New York City.

The person on the other end gave the racer one of [[Confucius]]'s proverbs: \"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure.\" Without writing it down, they had to repeat the proverb verbatim to a temple monk. Once they got the proverb right, they received their next clue. If they were incorrect, they had to call the number again and make another attempt.\n\nThe Hazard required Kaylani & Lisa to travel to the [[Core Pacific City]] Mall, where one of them had to perform an indoor [[bungee jump]] before they could continue racing.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the Starting Line, teams had to search through several hundred [[oil-paper umbrella]]s for one that had the correct set of letters (\"TAI\") printed on it. When combined twice with their clue of six other letters (\"WANPEI\"), it revealed the name of their first destination: Taipei, Taiwan. Once they presented Phil with the correct umbrella, he would give them keys to one of 11 [[Ford Explorer]]s parked outside the temple. The last team to complete the task was penalized with the [[The Amazing Race#Hazard|Hazard]].\n**The first eight teams to arrive at the airport were booked on an earlier flight from Los Angeles to Taipei with the remaining three teams booked on a second flight on another airline that departed twenty minutes later.\n*At Ximending Commercial District, teams were told to \"look up\" for their next clue and were left to figure out that their clue was displayed on an [[Digital billboard|electronic billboard]] at Jun Plaza: red and yellow balloons that revealed [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|\u53f0\u5317\u5b54\u5edf}} ([[Taipei Confucius Temple]]).\n*At Dajia Riverside Park, teams joined a [[dragon boat]] team.

A small sign at the orphanage also directed teams to donate ''all'' of the money in their possession. Teams that did not donate all of their money were not allowed to check in at the Pit Stop until they doubled back and donated it.\n*At the orphanage, teams received a [[coat of arms]] from the children and had to figure out that it belonged to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultan]] and that the Pit Stop was at his palace: [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat]].\n\n===Leg 3 (Indonesia)===\n[[File:BorobudurTemple.JPG|thumb|The iconic [[Borobudur]], the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in the world, served as both the site of this leg's Roadblock and the Pit Stop.]]\n'''Airdate''': October 9, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|bicycle}} Yogyakarta ([[Fort Vredeburg Museum|Fort Vredeburg]])\n*Salakmalang Village ([[Sundanese cuisine#Sundanese restaurant|Lesehan Restaurant]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Rice Field|Grass Fed}}\n*[[Magelang]] ([[Borobudur]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's prepared to follow the path to Buddha?}} {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|3}}\n\nIn this leg's Detour, teams chose between Rice Field and Grass Fed.

Teams would use the beds for an overnight stay at the village.\n\n===Leg 7 (Malawi)===\n[[File:Lakeshore village, Malawi.jpg|thumb|The Detour for this second leg in [[Malawi]] focused on tasks in [[Lake Malawi]].]]\n'''Airdate''': November 6, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|bus}} Lilongwe (Lilongwe Bus Station) to [[Salima, Malawi|Salima]] (Salima Bus Station) {{TAR clue|Speed Bump|Solve a Slide Puzzle}} {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's more fare minded?}}\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Dugout|Lugout}} [[Salima District|Chigumukile Village]] ([[Lake Malawi]])\n*Chigumukile Village (Jamaica Shop) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|double=yes|Laurence & Zac|Amani & Marcus|failed=yes|used2=no}}\n*Senga Bay ([https://www.sunbirdmalawi.com/hotels/sunbird-livingstonia Sunbird Livingstonia Beach]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|7}}\n\nFor their Speed Bump, Amani & Marcus had to solve a [[sliding puzzle]] that depicted the [[flag of Malawi]]{{efn|note=Malawi flag|At the time of filming, the [[flag of Malawi]] was the [[Flag of Malawi#Flag from 2010\u20132012|2010\u20132012 design]] featuring a full white sun. The design has since changed.}} before they could continue racing and catch up with the other teams.\n\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member used a bicycle taxi known as a ''kabaza'' to take a customer carrying fish to one of three different destinations written on a board tied to the fish. After they dropped off their customer at their required address, they headed back to the bus station to trade in their earnings of [[Malawian kwacha|MK]]100 (approximately {{USD}}0.66) to the ''kabaza'' dispatcher to obtain the next clue.\n\nThe Detour on [[Lake Malawi]] was a choice between Dugout and Lugout. In Dugout, teams participated in the annual Lake Malawi [[Dugout (boat)|Dugout Canoe]] Race and had to use the traditional canoes to paddle out to drummers on the lake before paddling back to shore to obtain their clue from a local fisherman. In Lugout, teams had to wade to a ferryboat on the lake and unload passengers and cargo from it by carrying them to shore. They had to unload two boxes of cabbage, two bundles of sugar cane, two bundles of brooms, one chair, one fan, and eight passengers, who expected to stay dry, before receiving their clue from the boat's porter.\n\n===Leg 8 (Malawi \u2192 Denmark)===\n[[File:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen 2.jpg|thumb|After arriving in [[Copenhagen]], teams had to climb to the top of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]]'s tower to search for their next clue.]]\n'''Airdate''': November 13, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Lilongwe (Lilongwe International Airport) to [[Copenhagen]], '''[[Denmark]]''' {{flagicon|DEN}} ([[Copenhagen Airport]])\n*Copenhagen ([[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]])\n*[[Hiller\u00f8d]] ([[Frederiksborg Castle]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to take a few steps back in time?}}\n*[[Kongens Lyngby]] ([[Frilandsmuseet]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|All Hopped Up|All Churned Out}}\n*Kongens Lyngby (Karlstrup Windmill) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|double=yes|Ernie & Cindy|Bill & Cathi|Bill & Cathi|Laurence & Zac}}\n*Copenhagen ([[Larsens Plads]] \u2013 ''Havet'' Ship) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|8}}\n\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to dress in period costume and learn a complex three-part dance from an instructor. Once the Countess was pleased with their dance, they received their next clue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between All Hopped Up and All Churned Out. In All Hopped Up, teams had to lay out a proper [[rabbit show jumping]] course. They then had to pick a rabbit and each team member ran it through the course without knocking over any of the obstacles. Once complete, the animal handler gave teams their next clue. In All Churned Out, teams had to make six sticks of [[butter]] by using a traditional [[butter churn]] to churn fresh cream, then stamp out the sticks using a special mold. When the [[Milkmaid|dairymaid]] approved of their work, teams would receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*After arriving in [[Copenhagen]], teams had to choose a marked [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]] and drive to the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]]. After climbing to the top of the Church of Our Saviour, teams had to search for two clues on the top of the tower. The first was a flag on the tower that said \"''{{lang|da|Borg Slot}}''\" and the other was a banner on a nearby building that said \"''{{lang|da|Frederiks}}''\". These led teams to their next location: [[Frederiksborg Castle]] in [[Hiller\u00f8d]].\n\n===Leg 9 (Denmark \u2192 Germany \u2192 Belgium)===\n[[File:Legoland Billund - Pirate Carousel.jpg|thumb|Teams visited [[Legoland Billund Resort|Legoland Billund]] where they rode the Pirate Carousel [[teacups]] while building their next clue out of [[Lego]] bricks.]]\n'''Airdate''': November 20, 2011\n*Copenhagen ([[H.

If they failed, they had to go back to the statue before returning to the theater to recite the poem again.\n\nAt Concert Noble, teams had to compete in a [[bodybuilding]] competition in honor of [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], known as \"The Muscles from Brussels\". Racers had to put on [[bikini]]s, cover their bodies in posing oil, and then learn a series of bodybuilding poses. They then used the poses in a routine performed in front of three judges for a score of twelve points. This task was originally planned as a Bodybuilding Pose Detour option and was shown as a miscellaneous task, leaving the other Detour option unknown to viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/17/exclusive-the-amazing-race-its-speedo-time-photos/|title=EXCLUSIVE: &#039;The Amazing Race&#039; Strips Down to Speedos for a Bodybuilding Challenge|accessdate=2011-11-21|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Additional task\n*At Legoland Billund, teams had to find the Pirate Carousel (a [[teacups]] ride), where they received a box containing a puzzle made of [[Lego]] bricks. While on the ride, they had to assemble the puzzle to reveal their next destination: the [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. Teams could work on the puzzle only while the ride was in motion and had to raise their hands when the ride stopped.\n\n===Leg 10 (Belgium)===\n[[File:Laeken Atomium 06.jpg|thumb|right|Teams ended their second leg in [[Belgium]] at the [[Atomium]], a famous landmark in the capital [[Brussels]].]]\n'''Airdate''': November 27, 2011\n*[[Lommel]] ([[Lommel Proving Grounds|Ford Proving Grounds]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to play with the ponies?}}\n*[[Ghent]] ([[Execution Bridge (Ghent)|Hoofdbrug]]) \n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Water or Waffle}} Ghent (Hoefslagstraatje and [[Lys (river)|Leie River]] ''or'' [[Dulle Griet]])\n*[[Geraardsbergen]] ([[Muur van Geraardsbergen]])\n*[[Beersel]] (Steenweg op Ukkel 75 ''or'' Stoofstraat 52)\n*Brussels ([[Atomium]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|10}}\n\nFor this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to test drive a [[Ford Mustang]]. They first had to accelerate to {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}} and then brake at a designated spot. They then had to navigate a [[Autocross|slalom]] course within sixteen seconds without hitting a cone and stopping inside a marked spot. Lastly, they finished the test drive by performing two victory [[Doughnut (driving)|doughnuts]] before they received their next clue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between Water and Waffle. In Water, teams had to use provided materials ([[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], rope, and wood) to build a raft to search the [[Lys (river)|Leie River]] for the two halves of their next clue. In Waffle, teams had to build a waffle stand and then bake and decorate eighteen [[Belgian waffle]]s to the chef's satisfaction before receiving their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the start of the leg, teams had to choose a marked [[Ford Fiesta#Sixth generation (2009\u20132019)|Ford Fiesta]] and drive themselves to [[Lommel Proving Grounds|Ford Proving Grounds]] in [[Lommel]] to get their next clue.\n*At Muur van Geraardsbergen, teams released a flock of [[homing pigeon]]s and then were given an address where the pigeons were flying. Once there, teams could retrieve their next clue from one of the pigeons.\n*The clue teams obtained from the pigeon was simply a picture of the [[Atomium]], which teams had to figure out in order to find the Pit Stop for this leg.\n\n===Leg 11 (Belgium \u2192 Netherlands \u2192 Panama)===\n[[File:Torre de la Catedral - Flickr - Chito.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]] in [[Panama City]] served as the Pit Stop on the penultimate leg of the Race.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 4, 2011\n*Brussels (Rue de l'\u00c9tuve \u2013 ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' Mural)\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Brussels (Brussels-South Railway Station) to [[Haarlemmermeer]], '''[[Netherlands]]''' {{flagicon|NED}} ([[Schiphol Airport railway station|Schiphol Airport Railway Station]])\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Amsterdam metropolitan area|Amsterdam]] ([[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]) to [[Panama City]], '''[[Panama]]''' {{flagicon|PAN}} ([[Tocumen International Airport]])\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} [[Chagres National Park]] (Puerto El Corotu to Parara Puru) (Overnight Rest)\n*{{TAR travel|boat}} Chagres National Park (Parara Puru to Puerto El Corotu)\n*Panama City ([[San Francisco, Panam\u00e1|San Francisco]] \u2013 San Francisco Bay Towers) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to walk on rarefied air?}}\n*Panama City ([[Casco Viejo, Panama|Casco Viejo]] ([[Casco Viejo, Panama#Main sights|Plaza de Francia]] \u2013 [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] Statue))\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Filet|Sole}} Panama City (El Mercado de Mariscos ''or'' Salsipuedes Market)\n*Panama City ([[Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary (Panama City)|Cathedral Square]])\n*Panama City ([[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|11}}\n\nFor this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to cross a [[tightrope]] between the San Francisco Bay Towers, 35 stories high and {{convert|65|ft|m}} across. The racer picked up their clue on the other tower and then made the trip back to the first tower before they could continue.\n\nThis leg's Detour was a choice between Filet and Sole. In Filet, teams traveled to Panama's largest [[fish market]], El Mercado de Mariscos, where they had to deliver fish to different marked stalls throughout the market. Each stall only accepted a certain kind of fish up to a certain weight. Once they were done with their deliveries, the [[fishmonger]] gave them their next clue. In Sole, teams traveled to the Salsipuedes Market where they had to find a [[sandals]] stall and use one piece of leather each to make the sole and strapping for a pair of sandals for a customer. Once the [[Shoemaker|cobbler]] was satisfied, teams received their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*Before leaving Brussels, teams had to dress up as the two bumbling [[Thomson and Thompson|detective characters]] from the popular Belgian ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comics, and figure out one of the three names (\"Thomson and Thompson\", \"Dupond and Dupont\", or \"Johnson and Johnston\") by which the characters are known in Belgium. Then, using a photo given to them with the clue, teams had to find a man dressed as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] standing in front of a Tintin mural and tell him any one of the name variations of the characters they were dressed as in order to receive their next clue.\n*At Parara Puru, teams signed up for one of four times the next morning within 15-minute intervals starting at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to receive a temporary [[tattoo]] that would reveal their next location: the San Francisco Bay Towers in Panama City.\n*After the Roadblock, teams were given a riddle to search for a man underneath a rooster, directing them to the statue of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] in Plaza de Francia.\n*At Cathedral Square, teams had to find a group of ''[[tamborito]]'' dancers wearing ''[[pollera]]'' dresses and had to find the location of the Pit Stop, [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo]], which was etched on the dancers' necklaces and written on one dancer's dress.\n\n===Leg 12 (Panama \u2192 United States)===\n[[File:Atlanta Swan House.jpg|thumb|[[Atlanta]]'s historic [[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]] was the Finish Line for the 19th ''Amazing Race''.]]\n'''Airdate''': December 11, 2011\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} Panama City (Tocumen International Airport) to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] {{flagicon|Georgia (U.S. state)}}, '''United States''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]])\n*Atlanta ([[Berkshire Hathaway#Flight services|FlightSafety International]])\n*Atlanta ([[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|Margaret Mitchell House]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who gives a damn?}}\n*Atlanta ([[Turner Field]])\n*Atlanta ([[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop}}\n\nThe final Roadblock required one team member to type out the team's next clue using a [[E. Remington and Sons|Remington 3]] [[typewriter]] to duplicate an example message. The duplicate had to be perfectly straight and neat with no mistakes. Additionally, the typewriters used for the task did not have a key for the number <tt>1</tt>; racers were left to figure out that they had to use the key for the lower-case letter <tt>l</tt> as a substitute.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At FlightSafety International, teams had to pick a [[flight instructor]], who taught them how to operate a [[Learjet]] [[flight simulator]]. They then had to successfully complete a simulated landing at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport from an altitude of {{convert|2500|ft}} in order to obtain the next clue.\n*The clue from FlightSafety International instructed teams to \"find the former residence known as 'The Dump'\", leaving them to figure out that this was a reference to the [[Margaret Mitchell House and Museum|home]] of [[Margaret Mitchell]], author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n*After completing the Roadblock, teams had to deduce that the series of three numbers on the clue were a homage to [[Hank Aaron]]: 44 (his [[uniform number]]), 715 (the number of home runs he hit to break the [[List of lifetime home run leaders in Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball home run record]]) and 74 (the [[1974 in baseball|year]] in which he broke the record). From this knowledge, teams had to figure out that they had to go to [[Turner Field]].\n*At Turner Field, teams had to use rock climbing gear to map out the ''Race'' course, excluding Germany and the Netherlands, from start to finish by looping a rope through a series of [[carabiner]]s, each representing a specific country, on a large vertical map. One team member worked on the map while his or her teammate gave help from the ground. Teams were not allowed to use notes while working on the task and the countries on the map were unlabeled. Once the map was looped correctly, teams received their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| #\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Airdate\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Episode\n!

This section also delineates the conditions under which LEAs should be given special consideration by the Secretary of Education. Those conditions are: \n\t\n# Demonstration of great need (determined in part by student to counselor, student to social worker and student to school psychologist ratios).\n# Proposal of especially innovative or promising programs.\n# Demonstration of great possibility for replication and dissemination.\n \nThis section also requires that the counseling services for which funds are provided follow certain guidelines. Those guidelines include requirements such as assurances that funds will be spent on programs that will be comprehensive in their approach, serve the needs of all students, increase the availability of services, employ qualified professionals, involve families and communities, evaluate the outcomes of the programs and show an innovative approach to providing services. The section also requires that the office of the Secretary of Education must make a report evaluating the programs that receive funds under the section.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subpart 2 \u2014 Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Programs|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg68.html#sec5421|work=Act of Congress|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Subpart 14, Section 5541: Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems ===\n\nThis section gives the Secretary of Education authority to award grants to and enter into contracts with a Local Education Agency, [[State Education Agency]] and Indian tribe to support programs that expand student access to mental health care through the creation of innovative links between schools and the community mental system. These grants are awarded based on an application process. The section limits these grants to a five-year period and requires that the funds be used by LEAs, SEAs and Indian tribes to expand or improve care for students as well as to provide training for school based and community based professionals (both educators and mental health service providers), consultation and technical assistance for schools and agencies, coordination of services that will fit students' language and cultural background, and evaluation of the programs for which grant money is provided.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC. 5541.

These grants are application based and required to be directed toward programs that help students to develop emotionally, socially and behaviorally; programs that help to coordinate families working with community-based programs that provide such services; programs that provide other services that support such community-based programs such as transportation services; programs that evaluate the success of such programs, or to provide funding for students to participate in or be evaluated for eligibility for such programs. Other requirements for these grants include that programs must not also be receiving funds from other sources and that the office of the Secretary of Education must evaluate or contract for an outside evaluation for each program that receives a grant.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC. 5542.

Daly et al. cited a [[National Institute of Mental Health]] study that found that between 5% and 9% of students face emotional and behavioral issues that impede their learning.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Daly|first=Brian P.|author2=Robert Burke |author3=Isadora Hare |author4=Carrie Mills |author5=Celeste Owens |author6=Elizabeth Moore |author7=Mark D.

They report that more than half of adults who have experienced a mental, emotional or behavioral disorder claim that it began during those early years and that by the age of sixteen nearly forty percent of children and young adults have experienced a psychiatric disorder.  Furthermore, the Department of Education reports that mental health concerns overlap with and in many cases undergird other important themes in education today, such as bullying. In their Introduction, the Department of Education cites one study that showed that both perpetrators and victims of incidences of bullying were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression than other students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems: Background and Introduction|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/mentalhealth/2010-215m.pdf|work=Information and Application Procedures|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn its report on the interaction of school policy and health issues for adolescents, the CDC notes that the state of mental health systems treatment in schools or coordinated by schools is much more extensive today than it once was.

These grants are awarded based on an application process. The section limits these grants to a five-year period and requires that the funds be used by LEAs, SEAs and Indian tribes to expand or improve care for students as well as to provide training for school based and community based professionals (both educators and mental health service providers), consultation and technical assistance for schools and agencies, coordination of services that will fit students' language and cultural background, and evaluation of the programs for which grant money is provided.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC. 5541.

The term highly qualified teachers (HQT) comes from the original language of Title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the No Child Left Behind Act.  Title II of NCLB designates federal funds to educational agencies for the purpose of improving the student achievement through the professional development of highly qualified teachers and principals.  To qualify for this funding, states must comply with a series of conditions stipulated in NCLB, and track their progress toward goals each state sets.  Title II was originally known as the Eisenhower Professional Development Program,<ref name=\"Title I Overview\">''No Child Left Behind: Title I Overview.

This provision has come under much scrutiny, as it is up to states to decide how to measure highly qualified, and states are not holding their teachers to the same level of rigor across the country.  Since its reauthorization in 2001, Title II has yet to reach its stated goal of ensuring that 100% of teachers in public schools in the United States are highly qualified.<ref name=\"Goldhaber\">Goldhaber, Dan.

Title II of NCLB designates federal funds to educational agencies for the purpose of improving the student achievement through the professional development of highly qualified teachers and principals.  To qualify for this funding, states must comply with a series of conditions stipulated in NCLB, and track their progress toward goals each state sets.

This provision has come under much scrutiny, as it is up to states to decide how to measure highly qualified, and states are not holding their teachers to the same level of rigor across the country.

An APR also includes reports and updates on laws, statutes, regulations, and/or guidelines that impact reform plans, as well as progress in meeting the \"absolute priority\" and \"competitive preference priority\", which emphasize a comprehensive focus on reform and an emphasis on STEM education.

In such integrated systems, students can access their assignments, grades and learning activities; parents can view the academic expectations of their child, and his or her school attendance and grades; and teachers and principals can access their students\u2019 data and find strategies and resources (e.g., sample lesson plans) to meet their instructional needs.

The applications were due into the [[U.S. Department of Education]] by Feb. 8, 2010. These funds were made available to states by formula and competed for by school districts. As they competed for the funds, school districts/local educational agencies (LEAs) were required to identify the schools they wanted to transform, and then determine which of four models was most appropriate: the turnaround model, the restart model, school closure, or the transformation model. The law delineates the requirements for each of the four models. If a school had begun implementation of one of these four models or components of one of these models within the previous two years, it was permitted to apply to use SIG funds to continue to implement the full model.\n\n==Lowest Achieving==\n\nThe SIG program reflects the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] prioritization of the lowest-achieving [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The [http://www.centerii.org/ Center on Innovation & Improvement], one of five federally funded content centers, has developed extensive guidance regarding implementation of the SIG program.<ref>Perlman, C. L., & Redding, S. (Eds.) (2009). ''Handbook on Effective Implementation of School Improvement Grants''. Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement.

Under guidance promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, states must distribute 95% of their SIG grant dollars to districts and, in turn, districts must prioritize awards to districts based on need as measured by individual schools\u2019 academic performance and concentration of [[poverty]]. As outlined in the law, when awarding subgrants to districts, states must \u201cgive priority to the local educational agencies with the lowest-achieving schools that demonstrate \u2014\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the greatest need for such funds; and\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the strongest commitment to ensuring that such funds are used to provide adequate resources to enable the lowest-achieving schools to meet the goals under school and local educational improvement, corrective action, and restructuring plans under section 1116.\u201d\n\nUnder the 2010 guidance related to Section 1003(g), state departments of education are required to identify their \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving\u201d schools . School districts that have schools identified as persistently lowest-achieving apply to the [[state department of education]] to obtain School Improvement Grants. As part of their grant application, districts must identify which of the four intervention models (i.e., turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation) they intend to implement in each of the identified lowest-achieving schools. While the LEAs must apply one of the four intervention models in schools defined as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving,\u201d once the state has allocated adequate resources to these schools, according to the federal requirements, the state can use the remaining School Improvement Grant funds for districts to implement other interventions and supports to improve other Title I schools (i.e., schools eligible for [[federal aid]] under Title I of ESEA [i.e., NCLB] due to high concentrations of poverty) in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.\n\n==Tiers==\nThe SIG regulations define three tiers of schools for purposes of obtaining SIG funds.<ref>U.S. Department of Education. (2009). ''School Improvement Grants--American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Notice of proposed requirements''. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved from: http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2009-3/082609d.html\n</ref> Each tier represents a level of priority for the SIG funds. In determining which districts receive grants, the state takes into account (1) the number of low-performing schools in the state, (2) the tiers these schools occupy, and (3) the LEA\u2019s capacity to effectively implement the models and strategies outlined in the SIG application. The three tiers of schools identified as lowest achieving, in priority order for assistance through School Improvement Grants, are:\n* Tier I: Title I schools in improvement, [[corrective action]], or restructuring that are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier II: Secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I-Part A funds and are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier III: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are not Tier I schools.\n\n==School Improvement Grant intervention models==\n\n===Turnaround model===\n\nChanges required to occur under the turnaround model as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education are:\n* Replace principal\n* Use locally adopted \"turnaround\" competencies to review and select staff for school (rehire no more than 50% of existing staff)\n* Implement strategies to recruit, place, and retain staff\n* Select and implement an instructional model based on student needs\n* Provide job-embedded [[professional development]] (PD) designed to build capacity and support staff\n* Ensure continuous use of data to inform and differentiate instruction\n* Provide increased learning time for staff and students\n* Provide social-emotional and community-oriented services and supports\n* Implement new [[governance]] structure\n* Grant operating flexibility to school leader\n\nSchools implementing the turnaround model may also implement any of the required or permissible strategies under the Transformation Model.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the turnaround model is that the existing configuration of [[leadership]] and instructional personnel has not created a learning environment in which students are succeeding. Therefore, in order to dramatically change the environment for the benefit of the children currently enrolled in the school, the adults must change.<ref>Center on Innovation & Improvement (Writer, Producer), & Council of Chief State School Officers (Producer).

A rigorous review process could take into consideration such things as an applicant\u2019s team, track record, instructional program, model\u2019s theory of action, and [[sustainability]]. As part of this model, a state must review the process the LEA will use/has used to select the partner.\n\nThe theory of action underlying restart, also referred to as \"Starting Fresh\" as first codified in the charter sector,<ref>Hassel, B.

Other schools should be within reasonable proximity to the closed school and may include, but are not limited to, charter schools or new schools for which achievement data are not yet available.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the closure model is that school capacity according to multiple measures (e.g., academic performance, school culture/expectations, teacher performance, or facilities) is so low as to preclude a reasonable expectation of dramatic improvement for students currently enrolled.<ref>\u2022\tSteiner, L.

For example, in a September 25, 2009 open letter to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Gail Connelly, Executive Director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), wrote, \u201cNAESP supports the Secretary\u2019s initiative to identify the lowest performing schools, establish rigorous interventions, provide them sufficient resources over multiple years to implement those interventions, and hold them accountable for improving student performance. However, we fundamentally disagree with the approach to enact this wide-ranging and transformational reform initiative with the simplistic and reactionary step of replacing principals as the first step in turning around low-performing schools. NAESP strongly supports reform models that provide the essential resources existing principals of low-performing schools must have to succeed. These resources include the necessary time, talent and tools.\u201d\n\nAnd on March 1, 2010, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] gave a speech speaking of the necessity of letting go teachers at failing schools such as those in the Central Falls (RI) School District's only high school, [[Dennis Van Roekel]], president of the [[National Education Association]], said, \u201cThe tone used to describe the teachers in Central Falls has been disparaging and unforgiving. It's time for federal officials to get out of the blame game and into the classroom. One thing is certain: Firing the entire faculty of a school that is on the path to improvement is no recipe for turning around a struggling high school. And relying on a magical pool of \u2018excellent teachers\u2019 to spring forth and replace them is na\u00efve at best and desperately misguided. Approaches that point the finger at educators do nothing to bring about substantive improvements for students. To the contrary, it provides a momentary perception of correcting a problem. But in reality, we all know that the solution is not blame, it is collaboration\u2014collaboration among school employees, management, parents and communities.

The applications were due into the [[U.S. Department of Education]] by Feb. 8, 2010. These funds were made available to states by formula and competed for by school districts. As they competed for the funds, school districts/local educational agencies (LEAs) were required to identify the schools they wanted to transform, and then determine which of four models was most appropriate: the turnaround model, the restart model, school closure, or the transformation model. The law delineates the requirements for each of the four models. If a school had begun implementation of one of these four models or components of one of these models within the previous two years, it was permitted to apply to use SIG funds to continue to implement the full model.\n\n==Lowest Achieving==\n\nThe SIG program reflects the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] prioritization of the lowest-achieving [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The [http://www.centerii.org/ Center on Innovation & Improvement], one of five federally funded content centers, has developed extensive guidance regarding implementation of the SIG program.<ref>Perlman, C. L., & Redding, S. (Eds.) (2009). ''Handbook on Effective Implementation of School Improvement Grants''. Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from: http://www.centerii.org/handbook/</ref> As outlined in the SIG regulations,<ref>U.S. Department of Education (2010). Guidance on School Improvement Grants Under Section 1003(g) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Washington, DC. Author. The final requirements for the SIG program, set forth in 74 FR 65618 (Dec. 10, 2009), and amended by the interim final requirements, set forth in 75 FR (Jan. 21, 2010) (final requirements), implement both the requirements of section 1003(g) of the ESEA and the flexibilities for the SIG program provided through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010</ref> the Department has articulated very specific parameters regarding the approaches states and districts are to use to drive dramatic improvement. Under guidance promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, states must distribute 95% of their SIG grant dollars to districts and, in turn, districts must prioritize awards to districts based on need as measured by individual schools\u2019 academic performance and concentration of [[poverty]]. As outlined in the law, when awarding subgrants to districts, states must \u201cgive priority to the local educational agencies with the lowest-achieving schools that demonstrate \u2014\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the greatest need for such funds; and\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the strongest commitment to ensuring that such funds are used to provide adequate resources to enable the lowest-achieving schools to meet the goals under school and local educational improvement, corrective action, and restructuring plans under section 1116.\u201d\n\nUnder the 2010 guidance related to Section 1003(g), state departments of education are required to identify their \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving\u201d schools . School districts that have schools identified as persistently lowest-achieving apply to the [[state department of education]] to obtain School Improvement Grants. As part of their grant application, districts must identify which of the four intervention models (i.e., turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation) they intend to implement in each of the identified lowest-achieving schools. While the LEAs must apply one of the four intervention models in schools defined as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving,\u201d once the state has allocated adequate resources to these schools, according to the federal requirements, the state can use the remaining School Improvement Grant funds for districts to implement other interventions and supports to improve other Title I schools (i.e., schools eligible for [[federal aid]] under Title I of ESEA [i.e., NCLB] due to high concentrations of poverty) in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.\n\n==Tiers==\nThe SIG regulations define three tiers of schools for purposes of obtaining SIG funds.<ref>U.S. Department of Education. (2009). ''School Improvement Grants--American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965: Notice of proposed requirements''. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved from: http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2009-3/082609d.html\n</ref> Each tier represents a level of priority for the SIG funds. In determining which districts receive grants, the state takes into account (1) the number of low-performing schools in the state, (2) the tiers these schools occupy, and (3) the LEA\u2019s capacity to effectively implement the models and strategies outlined in the SIG application. The three tiers of schools identified as lowest achieving, in priority order for assistance through School Improvement Grants, are:\n* Tier I: Title I schools in improvement, [[corrective action]], or restructuring that are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier II: Secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I-Part A funds and are identified by the SEA as \u201cpersistently lowest-achieving.\u201d\n* Tier III: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are not Tier I schools.\n\n==School Improvement Grant intervention models==\n\n===Turnaround model===\n\nChanges required to occur under the turnaround model as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education are:\n* Replace principal\n* Use locally adopted \"turnaround\" competencies to review and select staff for school (rehire no more than 50% of existing staff)\n* Implement strategies to recruit, place, and retain staff\n* Select and implement an instructional model based on student needs\n* Provide job-embedded [[professional development]] (PD) designed to build capacity and support staff\n* Ensure continuous use of data to inform and differentiate instruction\n* Provide increased learning time for staff and students\n* Provide social-emotional and community-oriented services and supports\n* Implement new [[governance]] structure\n* Grant operating flexibility to school leader\n\nSchools implementing the turnaround model may also implement any of the required or permissible strategies under the Transformation Model.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the turnaround model is that the existing configuration of [[leadership]] and instructional personnel has not created a learning environment in which students are succeeding. Therefore, in order to dramatically change the environment for the benefit of the children currently enrolled in the school, the adults must change.<ref>Center on Innovation & Improvement (Writer, Producer), & Council of Chief State School Officers (Producer).

Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from http://www.centerii.org/</ref> Under the turnaround model, change entails literal change of personnel as well as behavioral change by the high-capacity personnel that remain.\n\n===Restart model===\n\nUnder the restart model, the district converts a school or closes and reopens a school under a charter school operator, a charter management organization (CMO), or an education management organization (EMO) that has been selected through a rigorous review process.<ref>For additional information about charter management organizations, see: National Resource Center on Charter School Finance and Governance: http://www.charterresource.org/</ref> A restart model must enroll, within the grades it serves, any former student who wishes to attend the school. A rigorous review process could take into consideration such things as an applicant\u2019s team, track record, instructional program, model\u2019s theory of action, and [[sustainability]]. As part of this model, a state must review the process the LEA will use/has used to select the partner.\n\nThe theory of action underlying restart, also referred to as \"Starting Fresh\" as first codified in the charter sector,<ref>Hassel, B.

National Association of Charter School Authorizers. http://www.qualitycharters.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3381</ref> is that restart allows a state, district, or other authorizing entity to break the cycle of low achievement by making deep and fundamental changes to the way the school operates.

Other schools should be within reasonable proximity to the closed school and may include, but are not limited to, charter schools or new schools for which achievement data are not yet available.\n\nThe theory of action underlying the closure model is that school capacity according to multiple measures (e.g., academic performance, school culture/expectations, teacher performance, or facilities) is so low as to preclude a reasonable expectation of dramatic improvement for students currently enrolled.<ref>\u2022\tSteiner, L.

Under [[Title I]] of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965, SASA administers several Title I programs of supplementary instruction and other services. This includes programs such as the Improving Basic Programs Operated by LEAs and the Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk. Under [[Title III]] of the ESEA, SASA administers the State Formula Grant Program for English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement. SASA also administers the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program authorized by the [[McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] (P.L. 100-77).\n\n== Organization ==\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\nSASA is headed by a Director who reports to the Assistant Secretary and/or Deputy Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. The current director is Dr. Zollie Stevenson, Jr.\n\nSASA is divided into six Program Groups:\n\n=== Policy Coordination Group ===\nThe Policy Coordination Group is responsible for policy coordination and develops policy guidance that clarifies for implementation purposes the principal themes of the President's education blueprint. Title I formula grant allocations are also managed by this group as is the programmatic focus on services to non-public schools. The group influences the educational community and others who need to understand the parameters for implementing Title I requirements.\n\n=== Standards and Assessments Group ===\nThe Standards and Assessments Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop the standards and assessment systems required by the new [[Title I]]. The group provides direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized technical assistance through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment issues. They also work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.\n\n=== Instructional Change Group ===\nThe Instructional Change Group is responsible for changing the face of teaching and learning in [[Title I]] schools in a manner that focuses on what works to generate improved results for children. This unit helps technical assistance providers work with schools to implement Title I programs in ways that focus on improving classroom instruction, including the involvement of parents in their child's education. In addition, this unit works with States to design, implement, and evaluate State systems of support for making Title I targeted assistance and schoolwide programs more effective vehicles for instructional change and for turning around low-performing schools. This group also has responsibility for working with content and regional comprehensive centers funded by the Department to develop strategies and materials to aid schools in corrective action and restructuring.\n\n=== Monitoring Group ===\nThe Monitoring Group is responsible for instituting a process of achievement-focused monitoring for compliance with the implementation of [[Title I]], Parts A, B and D and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education programs. States not fully compliant are presented with the opportunity to take corrective actions to address identified concerns. It is through the monitoring process that this group influences the extent to which States, school districts, and schools consider how they are using federal education resources to improve student achievement.\n\n=== Accountability Group ===\nThe Accountability Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop and update the accountability systems used to hold school districts and schools responsible for student achievement under [[Title I]], Part A as amended by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB). This group reviews and recommends approval or disapproval of annual State amendments to their Title I required accountability plans and orchestrates the peer review process for the growth model accountability pilot program authorized by the Secretary. The group will also be involved with managing the development/refinement of data definitions associated with NCLB accountability and the annual Consolidated State Performance Report. The group will provide direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized TA through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment and accountability issues. They also will work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.\n\n=== Title III State Formula Grants Group ===\nThe Title III State Formula Grants Group is responsible for the administration of the [[Title III]] State formula grant program. The group works collaboratively with the [[Office of English Language Acquisition]] and the other SASA groups to develop policy guidance, monitor program compliance, ensure program accountability, and provide State and local educational agencies with technical assistance to develop and enhance their capacity for developing standards and assessment systems and providing high quality language instruction educational programs for [[English language learners]].\n\n== References ==\n[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/oese/achieve.html Student Achievement and School Accountability] U.S. Department of Education\n\n[[Category:Education terminology]]\n[[Category:Student assessment and evaluation]]\n", "text_old": "'''Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs''' ('''SASA''') is a division of the [[Office of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (OESE) of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) that administers programs of financial assistance to [[State education agency|State]] and [[Local Education Agency|local education agencies]] (LEA) and to colleges and universities.

Johnson at the ESEA signing ceremony, with his childhood schoolteacher Ms. Kate Deadrich Loney]]\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n\nThe '''Elementary and Secondary Education Act''' ('''ESEA''') was passed by the [[89th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on April 11, 1965. Part of Johnson's \"[[War on Poverty]]\", the act has been the most far-reaching federal legislation affecting education ever passed by the [[United States Congress]].\n\nJohnson proposed a major reform of federal education policy in the aftermath of his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election]], and his proposal quickly led to the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The act provides federal funding to [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], with funds authorized for [[professional development]], instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. The act emphasizes equal access to education, aiming to shorten the [[achievement gap]]s between students by providing federal funding to support schools with children from impoverished families.\n\nSince 1965, ESEA has been modified and reauthorized by Congress several times. The [[Bilingual Education Act]] provides support for [[bilingual education]] and educational efforts for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and other groups. The [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] prohibits discrimination against students and teachers. The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) introduced a testing regime designed to promote [[standards-based education reform in the United States|standards-based education]]. The [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] retained some of the testing requirements established by the NCLB, but shifted accountability provisions to the states.\n\n==Historical context==\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty.<ref>Bernstein (1996), pp. 183\u2013213.</ref>{{page range too broad|date=May 2019}} Education funding in the 1960s was especially tight due to the demographic challenges posed by the large [[Baby Boomer]] generation, but Congress had repeatedly rejected increased federal financing for public schools.<ref>Zelizer (2015), pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> Buoyed by his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], Johnson sought to dramatically increase federal funding for education at the start of his second term.<ref>Dallek (1998), pp. 195\u2013198.</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1965, President Johnson called for congressional efforts to improve education opportunities for America's children.  Wary of popular fears regarding increased federal involvement in local schools, the Johnson administration advocated giving local districts great leeway to use the new funds, which were to be first distributed as grants to each state.  Shortly thereafter, [[Carl D. Perkins]] (D-KY), the chair of the General Education Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]] introduced H.R. 2362.  With the Johnson administration's support, and after significant wrangling over the structure of the bill's funding formula committee, the full committee voted 23\u20138 to report it on March 2, 1965.  Following a failed attempt to derail the bill by Representative [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-VA), the House passed H.R. 2362 on March 26, 1965 in a 263\u2013153 roll-call vote.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\">\"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act\" The Legislation, [http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/esea The Great Society Congress]</ref>\n\nAs the Senate prepared to consider the education bill, S. 370, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to pass it without amendment, in hopes of avoiding the bill to be returned to the House to endure further reconsideration.  S. 370 was assigned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee]], which subsequently reported the bill to the Senate floor with unanimous support.  During the Senate debates, several amendments were introduced, though none passed. The Senate passed the bill in a 73\u201318 vote on April 7, 1965.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\"/>\n\nPresident Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law two days later on April 9, 1965.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\"/>\n\n==Sections of the original 1965 Act==\n* Title I \u2013 Financial Assistance To Local Educational Agencies For The Education Of Children Of Low-Income Families\n* Title II \u2013 School Library Resources, Textbooks, and other Instructional Materials\n* Title III \u2013 Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students\n* Title IV \u2013 Educational Research And Training\n* Title V \u2013 Grants To Strengthen State Departments Of Education\n* Title VI \u2013 General Provisions\n\nNew Titles Created by Early Amendments to 1965 Law\n\n[[File:United States Department of Education Blue Ribbon School Logo.jpg|thumb|2008 No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School Logo]]\n;1966 amendments (Public Law 89-750)\n* Title VI \u2013 Aid to Handicapped Children (1965 title VI becomes Title VII){{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n;1967 amendments (Public Law 90-247)\n* Title VII \u2013 Bilingual Education Programs (1966 title VII becomes Title VIII)\n\n===Title I===\n{{redirect|Title I|other uses of \"Title I\"|Title I (disambiguation)}}\n\n====Overview====\nTitle I (\"Title One\"), which is a provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act passed in 1965, is a program created by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] to distribute funding to schools and school districts with a high percentage of students from low-income families, with the intention to create programs that will better children who have special needs that without funding could not be properly supported.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Archambault |first1=Francis X. |last2=St. Pierre |first2=Robert |title=Effect of Federal Policy on Services Delivered Through ESEA Title I |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |date=May\u2013June 1980 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=33\u201346 |jstor=1163596 |doi=10.3102/01623737002003033 }}</ref>\nFunding is distributed first to [[State education agency|state educational agencies]] (SEAs) which then allocate funds to local educational agencies (LEA's) which in turn dispense funds to public schools in need.<ref name=\"Source 1\">{{cite web|author=National Center for Education Statistics|title=Fast Facts|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=158|publisher=Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>  Title I also helps children from families that have migrated to the United States and youth from intervention programs who are neglected or at risk of abuse.

The IASA attempted to coordinate federal resources and policies with the pre-existing efforts at the state and local levels in order to improve instruction for all students.  This reform made three major changes to Title I.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    It added math and reading/language arts standards to be used to assess student progress and provide accountability.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   It reduced the threshold for schools to implement school-wide programs from 75% poverty to 50% and gave schools a longer reign to use federal funding from multiple programs to dispense funds at a school wide level.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    Lastly, the IASA gave more local control overall so that federal officials and states could waive federal requirements that interfered with school improvements.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>\n\nThe most recent and significant alteration to the original Title I was made by its reauthorization under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).<ref name=\"Source 9\">{{cite web|title=Executive Summary \u2013 Evaluation of Title I Accountability Systems and School Improvement Efforts (TASSIE): First-Year Findings (2004)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/disadv/tassie1/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>   In this reauthorization, NCLB required increased accountability from its schools both from the teachers and from the students.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />   Yearly standardized tests were mandated in order to measure how schools were performing against the achievement bars set by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were also responsible for publishing annual report cards that detailed their student achievement data and demographics.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were now held accountable not only by punitive measures that would be taken if schools fail to meet [[Adequate Yearly Progress|Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)]], but also corrective actions were taken if states did not have an assessment system approved by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Under NCLB, Schools are also required to plan for \u201crestructuring\u201d if they fail to make AYP for three years after being identified for improvement.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  More schools took corrective action under NCLB than under IASA.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />    NCLB also required teachers to be highly qualified if hired using Title I funding.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />\n\nModern applications of the Title I money have been diverse.  Recent uses include wide-scale purchasing of iPads and other Internet using devices as electronic textbooks for students in 1:1 initiatives.  Along with this, students from low-income families often do not have adequate Internet access from home.  Thus, various public money, including Title I funds, are being investigated for possible use to provide cellular Internet access for students to receive remediation or other instructional content from home.  The purpose of 24/7 internet access from home is to close the gap between higher income families where remediation resources are generally more available through parents and additional services and low-income students where such resources are scarce.

Title V states that the government should endorse and support local education reforms that parallel reforms occurring at the state level. Parts of this section also state that the government should support innovative programs that help to improve an educational system. This includes support programs for libraries, scientific research leading to state and local educational agencies to put promising reforms into place, as well as for programs to improve teacher performance.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nTitle V also provides government grants given to educational institutions appropriating money to gifted programs for students, foreign language developers, as well as physical education, the arts, and overall mental health care of children and students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Title VII===\nAdded during the 1967 reauthorization of ESEA, Title VII introduced a program for [[bilingual education]]. It was championed by Texas Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]] (''Political Education'', Cross 2004). It was originally created to aid Spanish-speaking students. However, in 1968 it transformed to the all-encompassing [[Bilingual Education Act]] (BEA). In its original form, the BEA was not explicit in mandating that all school districts provide bilingual education services\u2014it left much room for interpretation by districts. The ruling in [[Lau v. Nichols]] provided some clarity\u2014specific program goals were established, support centers for bilingual education were created, and what a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d should look like was defined. The courts upheld the language of the BEA as it declared a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d as one providing English instruction in unison with the native language. The idea was to push students to high academic achievement via a program encouraging them to learn English while maintaining the native language.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/us-education-legislation/bilingual-education-act \"Bilingual Education Act.\"] K12academics, 2004\u20132011</ref> \"It proposed to cultivate in this child his ancestral pride, to reinforce (not destroy) the language he natively speaks, to cultivate his inherent strengths, to give him the sense of personal identification so essential to social maturation,\" summarizes Professor Cordasco of Montclair State College.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20372531|title = The Bilingual Education Act|journal = The Phi Delta Kappan|volume = 51|issue = 2|page = 75|last1 = Cordasco|first1 = Francesco|date = October 1969}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to programs for bilingual students, Title VII implemented plans to help Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaskan natives be provided opportunities for achieving academic equality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In late 1967, Congress gave $7.5 million to school districts, scholars, and private research groups who proposed the best programs for improving bilingual education.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 461110|title = Bilingual Problems and Developments in the United States|journal = PMLA|volume = 86|issue = 3|pages = 452\u2013458|last1 = Cannon|first1 = Garland|year = 1971|doi = 10.2307/461110}}</ref> This section of the ESEA promotes the federal government working closely with local educational institutions to ensure that Indian, Hawaiian, and Alaskan students are being aided in getting the same educational experiences as all other students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> This is achieved through programs that keep cultural values intact and push students to strive for academic excellence.\n\nIt is worth noting that Title VII was replaced in the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, and is now Title III \u201cLanguage Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students.\u201d\n\n==Effects on bilingual education==\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter established the Department of Education which allowed for the Bilingual Education campaign to expand bilingual education programs.<ref name=\"History of Bilingual Education\">Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/historyofbilingualed.htm \"History of Bilingual Education\"] Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> In addition to Carter's efforts, President Clinton also showed his support through the [[Improving America's Schools Act of 1994]].

There is no official language in the U.S., although some states have declared English as their official language. Three states in particular, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have declared English as their official language. In 1998, California passed [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] with the help of sponsor, [[Ron Unz]], essentially ending bilingual education programs in exchange for an English immersion model which values assimilation over multiculturalism. In 2000, Arizona passed the [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|English for Children]] initiative backed, again, by Ron Unz which mirrored California's Proposition 227 in replacing bilingual education programs with English immersion ones.\n\nMany Americans question whether bilingual education programs or English immersion models are the best route to helping students acquire English. The question of whether public education should encourage the development of the native tongue or completely leave that up to the parent is a difficult one. Some point out that California's Proposition 227 is failing the students for simply failing to address both the linguistic and cultural struggles that students face; in 2004, the test results for California public school students showed the achievement gap for English learners widening and the test scores of English learners to be declining across grade levels.<ref>Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm \"Legislation Timeline\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm |date=2011-09-20 }} Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> Scholar [[Stephen Krashen]] maintains that these three states who have taken the harshest anti-bilingual education policies have seen progress that is modest, at best.<ref>Krashen, S., [http://sdkrashen.com/articles/krashen_immersion.pdf \"How Well Are They Doing?

Johnson at the ESEA signing ceremony, with his childhood schoolteacher Ms. Kate Deadrich Loney]]\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n\nThe '''Elementary and Secondary Education Act''' ('''ESEA''') was passed by the [[89th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on April 11, 1965. Part of Johnson's \"[[War on Poverty]]\", the act has been the most far-reaching federal legislation affecting education ever passed by the [[United States Congress]].\n\nJohnson proposed a major reform of federal education policy in the aftermath of his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election]], and his proposal quickly led to the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The act provides federal funding to [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], with funds authorized for [[professional development]], instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. The act emphasizes equal access to education, aiming to shorten the [[achievement gap]]s between students by providing federal funding to support schools with children from impoverished families.\n\nSince 1965, ESEA has been modified and reauthorized by Congress several times. The [[Bilingual Education Act]] provides support for [[bilingual education]] and educational efforts for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and other groups. The [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974]] prohibits discrimination against students and teachers. The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) introduced a testing regime designed to promote [[standards-based education reform in the United States|standards-based education]]. The [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] retained some of the testing requirements established by the NCLB, but shifted accountability provisions to the states.\n\n==Historical context==\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty.<ref>Bernstein (1996), pp. 183\u2013213.</ref>{{page range too broad|date=May 2019}} Education funding in the 1960s was especially tight due to the demographic challenges posed by the large [[Baby Boomer]] generation, but Congress had repeatedly rejected increased federal financing for public schools.<ref>Zelizer (2015), pp. 174\u2013176.</ref> Buoyed by his landslide victory in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], Johnson sought to dramatically increase federal funding for education at the start of his second term.<ref>Dallek (1998), pp. 195\u2013198.</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1965, President Johnson called for congressional efforts to improve education opportunities for America's children.  Wary of popular fears regarding increased federal involvement in local schools, the Johnson administration advocated giving local districts great leeway to use the new funds, which were to be first distributed as grants to each state.  Shortly thereafter, [[Carl D. Perkins]] (D-KY), the chair of the General Education Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]] introduced H.R. 2362.  With the Johnson administration's support, and after significant wrangling over the structure of the bill's funding formula committee, the full committee voted 23\u20138 to report it on March 2, 1965.  Following a failed attempt to derail the bill by Representative [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-VA), the House passed H.R. 2362 on March 26, 1965 in a 263\u2013153 roll-call vote.<ref name=\"The Great Society Congress\">\"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act\" The Legislation, [http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/esea The Great Society Congress]</ref>\n\nAs the Senate prepared to consider the education bill, S. 370, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to pass it without amendment, in hopes of avoiding the bill to be returned to the House to endure further reconsideration.

The IASA attempted to coordinate federal resources and policies with the pre-existing efforts at the state and local levels in order to improve instruction for all students.  This reform made three major changes to Title I.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    It added math and reading/language arts standards to be used to assess student progress and provide accountability.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>   It reduced the threshold for schools to implement school-wide programs from 75% poverty to 50% and gave schools a longer reign to use federal funding from multiple programs to dispense funds at a school wide level.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>    Lastly, the IASA gave more local control overall so that federal officials and states could waive federal requirements that interfered with school improvements.<ref name=\"Source 4\"/>\n\nThe most recent and significant alteration to the original Title I was made by its reauthorization under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).<ref name=\"Source 9\">{{cite web|title=Executive Summary \u2013 Evaluation of Title I Accountability Systems and School Improvement Efforts (TASSIE): First-Year Findings (2004)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/disadv/tassie1/index.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>   In this reauthorization, NCLB required increased accountability from its schools both from the teachers and from the students.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />   Yearly standardized tests were mandated in order to measure how schools were performing against the achievement bars set by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were also responsible for publishing annual report cards that detailed their student achievement data and demographics.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Schools were now held accountable not only by punitive measures that would be taken if schools fail to meet [[Adequate Yearly Progress|Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)]], but also corrective actions were taken if states did not have an assessment system approved by Title I.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  Under NCLB, Schools are also required to plan for \u201crestructuring\u201d if they fail to make AYP for three years after being identified for improvement.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />  More schools took corrective action under NCLB than under IASA.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />    NCLB also required teachers to be highly qualified if hired using Title I funding.<ref name=\"Source 9\" />\n\nModern applications of the Title I money have been diverse.  Recent uses include wide-scale purchasing of iPads and other Internet using devices as electronic textbooks for students in 1:1 initiatives.  Along with this, students from low-income families often do not have adequate Internet access from home.  Thus, various public money, including Title I funds, are being investigated for possible use to provide cellular Internet access for students to receive remediation or other instructional content from home.  The purpose of 24/7 internet access from home is to close the gap between higher income families where remediation resources are generally more available through parents and additional services and low-income students where such resources are scarce.  Educational Technology advocates have long cited 24/7 Internet access as a boon to the education and advancement of at-risk children.\n\n====Funding====\nUnder NCLB, Title I funding is given to schools where at least 35% of the children in the school attendance area come from low-income families or to schools where 35% of the student population is low-income.<ref name=\"Source 10\">{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Requirements for Schools|url=http://www.greatschools.org/definitions/nclb/nclb.html|publisher=Great Schools}}</ref>    To determine the percentage of low-income families, school districts may select a poverty measure from among the following data sources: (1) the number of children ages 5\u201317 in poverty counted in the most recent census; (2) the number of children eligible for free and reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program; (3) the number of children in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; (4) the number of children eligible to receive Medicaid assistance; or (5) a composite of these data sources.

Title V states that the government should endorse and support local education reforms that parallel reforms occurring at the state level. Parts of this section also state that the government should support innovative programs that help to improve an educational system. This includes support programs for libraries, scientific research leading to state and local educational agencies to put promising reforms into place, as well as for programs to improve teacher performance.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nTitle V also provides government grants given to educational institutions appropriating money to gifted programs for students, foreign language developers, as well as physical education, the arts, and overall mental health care of children and students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Title VII===\nAdded during the 1967 reauthorization of ESEA, Title VII introduced a program for [[bilingual education]]. It was championed by Texas Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]] (''Political Education'', Cross 2004). It was originally created to aid Spanish-speaking students. However, in 1968 it transformed to the all-encompassing [[Bilingual Education Act]] (BEA). In its original form, the BEA was not explicit in mandating that all school districts provide bilingual education services\u2014it left much room for interpretation by districts. The ruling in [[Lau v. Nichols]] provided some clarity\u2014specific program goals were established, support centers for bilingual education were created, and what a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d should look like was defined. The courts upheld the language of the BEA as it declared a \u201cbilingual education program\u201d as one providing English instruction in unison with the native language. The idea was to push students to high academic achievement via a program encouraging them to learn English while maintaining the native language.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/us-education-legislation/bilingual-education-act \"Bilingual Education Act.\"] K12academics, 2004\u20132011</ref> \"It proposed to cultivate in this child his ancestral pride, to reinforce (not destroy) the language he natively speaks, to cultivate his inherent strengths, to give him the sense of personal identification so essential to social maturation,\" summarizes Professor Cordasco of Montclair State College.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20372531|title = The Bilingual Education Act|journal = The Phi Delta Kappan|volume = 51|issue = 2|page = 75|last1 = Cordasco|first1 = Francesco|date = October 1969}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to programs for bilingual students, Title VII implemented plans to help Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaskan natives be provided opportunities for achieving academic equality.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In late 1967, Congress gave $7.5 million to school districts, scholars, and private research groups who proposed the best programs for improving bilingual education.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 461110|title = Bilingual Problems and Developments in the United States|journal = PMLA|volume = 86|issue = 3|pages = 452\u2013458|last1 = Cannon|first1 = Garland|year = 1971|doi = 10.2307/461110}}</ref> This section of the ESEA promotes the federal government working closely with local educational institutions to ensure that Indian, Hawaiian, and Alaskan students are being aided in getting the same educational experiences as all other students.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> This is achieved through programs that keep cultural values intact and push students to strive for academic excellence.\n\nIt is worth noting that Title VII was replaced in the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, and is now Title III \u201cLanguage Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students.\u201d\n\n==Effects on bilingual education==\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter established the Department of Education which allowed for the Bilingual Education campaign to expand bilingual education programs.<ref name=\"History of Bilingual Education\">Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/historyofbilingualed.htm \"History of Bilingual Education\"] Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> In addition to Carter's efforts, President Clinton also showed his support through the [[Improving America's Schools Act of 1994]].

There is no official language in the U.S., although some states have declared English as their official language. Three states in particular, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have declared English as their official language. In 1998, California passed [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] with the help of sponsor, [[Ron Unz]], essentially ending bilingual education programs in exchange for an English immersion model which values assimilation over multiculturalism. In 2000, Arizona passed the [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|English for Children]] initiative backed, again, by Ron Unz which mirrored California's Proposition 227 in replacing bilingual education programs with English immersion ones.\n\nMany Americans question whether bilingual education programs or English immersion models are the best route to helping students acquire English. The question of whether public education should encourage the development of the native tongue or completely leave that up to the parent is a difficult one. Some point out that California's Proposition 227 is failing the students for simply failing to address both the linguistic and cultural struggles that students face; in 2004, the test results for California public school students showed the achievement gap for English learners widening and the test scores of English learners to be declining across grade levels.<ref>Cerda N. and Hernandez C., [http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm \"Legislation Timeline\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm |date=2011-09-20 }} Bilingual Education, 2006</ref> Scholar [[Stephen Krashen]] maintains that these three states who have taken the harshest anti-bilingual education policies have seen progress that is modest, at best.<ref>Krashen, S., [http://sdkrashen.com/articles/krashen_immersion.pdf \"How Well Are They Doing?

The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the law used as the primary statute governing the federal government's role in education. \n\nThe federal government's role in this area was earlier defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The ESEA stated that its purpose was to strengthen and improve educational quality and educational opportunities in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. These goals were to be achieved through financial assistance to local educational agencies for the education of children of low-income families or with disabilities.<ref name=\"ESEA\">{{cite web|url=http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514222926/http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-05-14 |title=Elementary & Secondary Education Act (ESEA)(P.L. 89-10) }}</ref> In 2001, ESEA was modified and renamed the No Child Left Behind Act.<ref name=\"No Child Left Behind Act\">{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam |last=Dillon}}</ref> Strengthening and improving the education of elementary and secondary school students remains the goal of NCLB and the AYP measurement.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, AYP is a diagnostic tool that determines how schools need to improve and where financial resources should be allocated. Former [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] wrote, \"The statute gives States and local educational agencies significant flexibility in how they direct resources and tailor interventions to the needs of individual schools identified for improvement... schools are held accountable for the achievement of all students, not just average student performance.\"<ref>Paige, R.

Those that do not meet AYP for two years in a row are identified as \"schools in need of improvement\" and are subject to immediate interventions by the [[State Education Agency]] in their state. First steps include [[technical assistance]] and then, according to the Department of Education, \"more serious corrective actions\" occur if the school fails to make AYP.<ref>(nd) [ \"The Facts About...Making Gains Every Year\".] U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved 6/31/07.</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the No Child Left Behind Act is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach. This is ensured through the use of academic assessments, teacher preparation and training, rigorous curriculum and adequate and proper instructional material that will in turn aid in performance on the challenging state academic standards that all students are to meet with proficiency. This process is meant to help meet the educational needs of low-achieving children in the nation's poverty-stricken schools, and have every school performing at a national standard level. If this is achieved, then NCLB is said to have \"closed the gap\". This means that the achievement gap between high- and low-performing schools and children will be less prominent and all will be achieving at the same level and standard throughout the nation. Thus, there will be no child left behind and no schools identified as \"schools in need of improvement\".<ref name=\"StatementofPurpose\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg1.html#sec1001 |title=Title I.

Retrieved 6/29/07.</ref>\n\nHowever, outside critics and analysts continue to make their own suggestions on improvements for Adequate Yearly Progress.  One example of this is Robert Manwaring (a Senior Policy Analyst at Education Sector), who has many suggestions at the federal, state and local levels.  On the federal level, Manwaring believes that No Child Left Behind has been too \"hands-off\"  and that states have been avoiding hard choices such as replacing people in failing schools. He believes intervention in low-performing districts has been too slow to occur.  He believes the key is for the federal government to insist on heavier oversight from the states and to propose shorter timelines for quicker actions to be taken with consistently failing schools.  He believes the federal government should continue to invest in school improvement, but move from a \"formula-driven program\" to competitive grants, which will reward schools who make drastic improvement in low-performing schools. He believes that states should be in charge of approving the \"other major restructuring plans\" (as discussed above) for schools, in order to ensure that they are the right steps to drastically improve student performance.  Lastly, he believes Title I funding \"comparability\" requirements should be changed to make sure that all Title I schools receive an accurate amount of state and local funding.  \n\nOn the state level, Manwaring believes that states are reluctant to intervene in low-performing schools, and that many state departments lack the experience or capacity to facilitate school turnaround anyway.  He suggests that states should identify schools in need of improvement, and require districts to implement an intervention model, during which the state will provide support and monitor progress.  He believes they should take control of charter schools by ensuring effective charter oversight, closing low-performing charter schools and providing a fair amount of funding and facilities to successful charters.  Lastly, he states should monitor school restructuring closely and be prepared to step in when needed.  \n\nOn the local level, Manwaring believes that since local school districts are closest to the schools, and have the flexibility necessary to act immediately for students, they should change their policies to ensure that schools have an equal amount of resources, and to reinforce the fact that long-term failure is unacceptable. He suggests that districts push for collective bargaining agreements that allow for improving the staff at low-performing schools, including evaluation systems that allow for the timely removal of poor performing teachers.  He also believes that school leaders must be able to make radical changes quickly in order to turn around low-performing schools, with high teacher investment in such policies.  Lastly, he believes that school districts need to be prepared to establish new schools in order to close the lowest-performing schools over time.<ref name=\"Manwaring\" />\n\n==Controversy==\nSchools across the country have restructured according to standards dictated by the federal government, rather than local needs.

States have developed a variety of incentives to encourage this. These include tuition benefits, loan forgiveness programs, and housing assistance, to encourage people to enter the profession in general, to better their qualifications, or to work in particular school settings. NCLB required that Illinois stop the use of unqualified teachers and in place offered more training so that teachers could come back under NCLB guidelines. After this, employment of not-fully certified teachers was much less prevalent even in the schools with highest poverty and numbers of minorities, where not-fully certified teachers are most seen.<ref name=\"Teacher Qualifications\">{{cite web |url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=9&sid=e6969228-2cf1-416e-a644-9c280dd1623d%40sessionmgr11&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=eft&AN=508134443 |title=The Changing Distribution of Teacher Qualifications Across Schools: A Statewide Perspective Post-NCLB. }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Present state of NCLB==\nOn January 8, 2002, George W.

According to Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, it has created an artificial goal of proficiency that actually encouraged states to lower their standards to make it easier for students to meet goals and bring the school to meet AYP. Duncan also believes that this kind of system narrows curriculum and mislabels schools as failing, even though they may be demonstrating academic growth in other ways other than state tests. Over the years since NCLB has been in place, 44 states have made strides in raising their standards but are now having to explain why their schools are \"failing\". To fix this, the secretary of state believes the law needs to be less prescriptive and allow school districts to create their own improvement plans unique to their needs. In 2015, the Obama administration offered states flexibility from NCLB in exchange for their own fair and flexible plans to raise standards.

The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the law used as the primary statute governing the federal government's role in education. \n\nThe federal government's role in this area was earlier defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The ESEA stated that its purpose was to strengthen and improve educational quality and educational opportunities in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. These goals were to be achieved through financial assistance to local educational agencies for the education of children of low-income families or with disabilities.<ref name=\"ESEA\">{{cite web|url=http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514222926/http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-05-14 |title=Elementary & Secondary Education Act (ESEA)(P.L. 89-10) }}</ref> In 2001, ESEA was modified and renamed the No Child Left Behind Act.<ref name=\"No Child Left Behind Act\">{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam |last=Dillon}}</ref> Strengthening and improving the education of elementary and secondary school students remains the goal of NCLB and the AYP measurement.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, AYP is a diagnostic tool that determines how schools need to improve and where financial resources should be allocated. Former [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] wrote, \"The statute gives States and local educational agencies significant flexibility in how they direct resources and tailor interventions to the needs of individual schools identified for improvement... schools are held accountable for the achievement of all students, not just average student performance.\"<ref>Paige, R.

Those that do not meet AYP for two years in a row are identified as \"schools in need of improvement\" and are subject to immediate interventions by the [[State Education Agency]] in their state.

This is ensured through the use of academic assessments, teacher preparation and training, rigorous curriculum and adequate and proper instructional material that will in turn aid in performance on the challenging state academic standards that all students are to meet with proficiency. This process is meant to help meet the educational needs of low-achieving children in the nation's poverty-stricken schools, and have every school performing at a national standard level. If this is achieved, then NCLB is said to have \"closed the gap\". This means that the achievement gap between high- and low-performing schools and children will be less prominent and all will be achieving at the same level and standard throughout the nation. Thus, there will be no child left behind and no schools identified as \"schools in need of improvement\".<ref name=\"StatementofPurpose\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg1.html#sec1001 |title=Title I.

One example of this is Robert Manwaring (a Senior Policy Analyst at Education Sector), who has many suggestions at the federal, state and local levels.  On the federal level, Manwaring believes that No Child Left Behind has been too \"hands-off\"  and that states have been avoiding hard choices such as replacing people in failing schools. He believes intervention in low-performing districts has been too slow to occur.  He believes the key is for the federal government to insist on heavier oversight from the states and to propose shorter timelines for quicker actions to be taken with consistently failing schools.  He believes the federal government should continue to invest in school improvement, but move from a \"formula-driven program\" to competitive grants, which will reward schools who make drastic improvement in low-performing schools. He believes that states should be in charge of approving the \"other major restructuring plans\" (as discussed above) for schools, in order to ensure that they are the right steps to drastically improve student performance.  Lastly, he believes Title I funding \"comparability\" requirements should be changed to make sure that all Title I schools receive an accurate amount of state and local funding.  \n\nOn the state level, Manwaring believes that states are reluctant to intervene in low-performing schools, and that many state departments lack the experience or capacity to facilitate school turnaround anyway.  He suggests that states should identify schools in need of improvement, and require districts to implement an intervention model, during which the state will provide support and monitor progress.  He believes they should take control of charter schools by ensuring effective charter oversight, closing low-performing charter schools and providing a fair amount of funding and facilities to successful charters.  Lastly, he states should monitor school restructuring closely and be prepared to step in when needed.  \n\nOn the local level, Manwaring believes that since local school districts are closest to the schools, and have the flexibility necessary to act immediately for students, they should change their policies to ensure that schools have an equal amount of resources, and to reinforce the fact that long-term failure is unacceptable. He suggests that districts push for collective bargaining agreements that allow for improving the staff at low-performing schools, including evaluation systems that allow for the timely removal of poor performing teachers.  He also believes that school leaders must be able to make radical changes quickly in order to turn around low-performing schools, with high teacher investment in such policies.  Lastly, he believes that school districts need to be prepared to establish new schools in order to close the lowest-performing schools over time.<ref name=\"Manwaring\" />\n\n==Controversy==\nSchools across the country have restructured according to standards dictated by the federal government, rather than local needs. A principal of one such school remarked, \"Putting all of the neediest special education students in a few schools seems to create insoluble challenges under No Child Left Behind.\" Those determinations often come down to the performance of small numbers of students that do not reflect the progress of the whole school.<ref>Marshall, T.

Also, NCLB is thought to provide teachers with the motive to focus energy in the classroom towards the types of questions that students will face on proficiency-based tests as opposed to other questions and topics that should be addressed equally.<ref name=\"Evaluating NCLB\">{{cite web |url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=9&sid=6274955d-fa2a-48e4-aa86-2f06920dbaee%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=eft&AN=508175616 |title=Evaluating NCLB }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York State Department of Education]] is among a group of [[state education agency|state education agencies]] that have voiced support for AYP.<ref>[http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child No Child Left Behind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143713/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html |date=2007-05-09 }}.

States have developed a variety of incentives to encourage this. These include tuition benefits, loan forgiveness programs, and housing assistance, to encourage people to enter the profession in general, to better their qualifications, or to work in particular school settings. NCLB required that Illinois stop the use of unqualified teachers and in place offered more training so that teachers could come back under NCLB guidelines. After this, employment of not-fully certified teachers was much less prevalent even in the schools with highest poverty and numbers of minorities, where not-fully certified teachers are most seen.<ref name=\"Teacher Qualifications\">{{cite web |url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=9&sid=e6969228-2cf1-416e-a644-9c280dd1623d%40sessionmgr11&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=eft&AN=508134443 |title=The Changing Distribution of Teacher Qualifications Across Schools: A Statewide Perspective Post-NCLB. }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Present state of NCLB==\nOn January 8, 2002, George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. According to Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, it has created an artificial goal of proficiency that actually encouraged states to lower their standards to make it easier for students to meet goals and bring the school to meet AYP. Duncan also believes that this kind of system narrows curriculum and mislabels schools as failing, even though they may be demonstrating academic growth in other ways other than state tests. Over the years since NCLB has been in place, 44 states have made strides in raising their standards but are now having to explain why their schools are \"failing\". To fix this, the secretary of state believes the law needs to be less prescriptive and allow school districts to create their own improvement plans unique to their needs. In 2015, the Obama administration offered states flexibility from NCLB in exchange for their own fair and flexible plans to raise standards. So far, 42 states have shown interest in this system and are currently working with the Department of Education.
