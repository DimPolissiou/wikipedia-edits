''Cooked paskha'' is made in the form of an egg [[custard]], to which the remaining ingredients are folded in. An ''uncooked paskha'' is made simply of the raw curd and the other ingredients mixed at room temperature. Since uncooked curd cannot be conserved for a long period of time, these paskhas are typically made smaller.\n\nThe tvorog is first [[pressure|pressed]] in order to eliminate the maximum amount of liquid possible, then put twice through a sieve to make a homogeneous mass. If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterward, it is placed in a traditional wooden mould assembly called ''pasochnitsa'' (\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430), with a layer of [[cheese cloth]] protecting the mould. The wooden mould can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays. The mould is cooled for twelve hours in a cold, but not freezing place (typically in a [[Root cellar|cellar]] or [[refrigerator]]). Finally, the paskha is turned out of the mould, the cheesecloth removed, and put on a dish. It may then be decorated with candied fruits, nuts, or flowers.
