This is done either as an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual US presidents with a fictional presidency at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n==M==\n===[[Douglas MacArthur]]===\n* President in: ''Resistance: A Hole in the Sky''\n* 35th President of the United States.\n* Commander of the United States Armed Forces during the Chimeran War.\n* Became Acting President of the United States following the death of President Harvey McCullen during the Chimera's invasion of the U.S. in 1953. \n* Killed in action against the Chimera in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1953. \n* Succeeded by Assistant Secretary of the Interior Thomas Voss.\n\n===[[James Madison]]===\n* In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the short story \"[[He Walked Around the Horses]]\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], '''James Madison''' was a major participant in the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] in the colonies of the [[British North America]] in the 1770s. In 1809, he was living in exile in [[Switzerland]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence, Madison was the current [[President of the United States]] in 1809 and was preceded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the author of the American rebels' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Philadelphia]].\n* In the short story \"The War of '07\" by [[Jayge Carr]] in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''James Madison''' served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in the cabinet of [[Aaron Burr]], who became the 3rd president after defeating [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 election]].\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s alternative history series ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'', '''James Madison''' served as the 4th president from March 4, 1809 to March 4, 1817, as he did in real life. Due to his [[Virginia]] heritage as well as his [[Anti-Federalism|anti-Federalist]] views, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of history taught in the United States after the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. Many in the United States presumed that Cassius Madison, the 16-year-old Confederate black boy who had killed [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate States President]] [[Jake Featherston]] on July 7, 1944, had taken his surname in honor of President Madison. In fact, Cassius had taken it from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he had gunned down Featherston. He had never even heard of Madison before he began his tour of the United States after the end of the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] (1941\u20131944).\n* In the 1988 short story ''[[The Reploids]]'' by [[Stephen King]], Edward Paladin, who is revealed to be the counterpart of [[Johnny Carson]] as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)#Stranger in a strange land|parallel universe]], has a deep-blue [[United States one-dollar bill]] in his wallet with '''James Madison''' on it, implying that he served as the first president of the United States instead of [[George Washington]] in Paladin's universe.\n* In the short story ''Hamilton vs. Napoleon'' by Elizabeth Bennet, [[Alexander Hamilton]] announces in June 1804 that he would not fight a [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|duel]] with [[Aaron Burr]]. '''James Madison''' is defeated for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] nomination in 1808 by Burr, who in turn was defeated by Hamilton in the [[1808 United States presidential election|general election]].\n\n===[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]===\n* In the alternative history novels ''[[The Great War: Walk in Hell]]'' and ''[[American Empire: Blood and Iron]]'', part of the [[Southern Victory Series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Alfred Thayer Mahan''' is mentioned as having served as president from 1889 to 1897. Mahan's place in the pantheon of \"great US presidents\" was assured when he forced the [[Confederate States of America]] to abandon its proposal to build a [[Nicaragua Canal|canal]] in [[Nicaragua]]. President Mahan was credited with the observation that the main problem with republics is that \"over time, the voters are apt to get tired of paying for what their country needs to defend itself.\" He was succeeded by [[Thomas Brackett Reed]], who served as president from 1897 until he died in office in 1902.\n\n===[[George Marshall]]===\n* President in \"[[Thor Meets Captain America]]\", 1987 novelette by [[David Brin]]\n* Mentioned as being president in 1962, three years after his death in real life.\n\n===[[Thomas R. Marshall]]===\n* In the 1953 alternate history novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' by [[Ward Moore]], '''Thomas Marshall''' is elected president in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]] as candidate for the Populist Party. He is then defeated for reelection in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] by [[William Hale Thompson]].\n* In the short story ''Peace in Our Times'' by Edith F. Milner, following the severe stroke which in October 1919 completely incapacitated President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a group of Congressional leaders initiated a  joint resolution of both Houses calling upon Vice President '''Thomas Marshall''' to assume full power as [[Acting President]], \"Until such time as the President is able to take up his duties again\". In the event, Marshall retained power until the end of Wilson's term - an effort by First Lady [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith Wilson]] to have her husband resume his duties when his condition improved a bit failing when doctors examined Wilson and unanimously found him \"still far too weak\". The most urgent issue on Marshall's agenda was to secure the United States' adherence to the [[League of Nations]] and overcome the strong opposition on Capitol Hill. Opponents especially attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country's return to war without an act of Congress. Negotiating with European leaders, Marshall secured a change making that contentious tenth article non-binding. He then managed to let US adherence to the League of Nations be ratified after a long and tense Congressional debate, including several filibusters. The debate confirmed Marshall's reputation as a strong, decisive leader, and in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] he easily gained the Democratic nomination and swept to power, with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] as his running mate. Marshall took a strong anti-[[isolationist]] line, declaring at his inauguration: \"For a hundred years we Americans deluded ourselves that wide oceans divide us from the wider world and that we can afford to turn a blind eye to the problems of other continents. But that egg was shattered to small pieces on the day when [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania was sunk]], and no amount of hand-wringing can put it back together again. When we went to war, the United States had taken on a decisive responsibility for the fate of Europe, of the entire world. We cannot shrug off this responsibility once our boys have come home again. We dare not - lest a new generation of American boys, twenty years hence, be asked to shed their blood on European soil all over again!\". In his term, Marshall took considerable effort to consolidate an anti-isolationist bloc in Congress, often intervening in various Congressional races. In Europe, he put considerable pressure on British and French leaders to soften the more harsh terms imposed on Germany in the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It was especially due to him that Germany was allowed to stop paying war reparations in 1925, shortly before Marshall's death. Franklin Roosevelt, who succeeded to the Presidency and was re-elected in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], continued Marshall's policy, which eventually became a bi-partisan policy followed by all Presidents in the following decades. As part of this policy of \"American Vigilance Over the Peace of Europe\", in January 1933 the American Ambassador to Berlin informally but firmly cautioned German President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] against appointing \"an irresponsible firebrand\" named [[Adolf Hitler]] as German Chancellor. The warning was seconded by the British and French Ambassadors. Although leaked to some sensational papers, who complained of \"American interference in German internal affairs\", the allegations were denied by the State Department and the German Presidential Bureau alike. Hitler eventually dropped from view, failing to secure re-election to the German Parliament. In 2020, large scale celebrations were held in [[Geneva]] to mark the League of Nations Centenary. World leaders gathered to unveil a giant statue of Thomas Marshall, the inscription reading \"The Family of Nations will ever cherish the memory of the Great Pioneer, whose Strong Leadership helped give Humanity a Century of Peace\".\n\n===[[John McCain]]===\n* In the [[future history]] [[graphic novel]] ''[[Shooting War]]'' by [[Anthony Lapp\u00e9]], '''McCain''' was president in 2011.\n* In the ''[[Treehouse of Horror XIX]]'' episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Homer attempts to vote for [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] but his electronic voting machine registers his multiple attempts to do so as six votes for McCain; upon realizing that the machine is rigged, Homer attempts to head out to report the mishap, but the machine sucks him in and kills him to hide the truth.\n\n===[[Eugene McCarthy]]===\n* President in Robert O'Connel's \"Cuban Crisis: Second Holocaust\". He was elected as the 38th president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], in the long aftermath of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962 which escalated into [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The US reacted drastically to the destruction of [[Washington, D.C.]] by totally destroying the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] and killing some 90% of their populations. It was subsequently accused of having perpetrated [[genocide]]. [[Richard Nixon]], who as elected as the 37th president in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], had driven the US into complete international isolation and made it a [[pariah state|pariah nation]]. '''McCarthy''' soundly defeated the incumbent Nixon in 1968, promising \"global reconciliation and healing\" and winning no less than 76% of the popular vote. McCarthy's success as president was only partial. He did reduce the American nuclear arsenal but refused to completely dispose of it, which the rest of the world found inadequate. He did manage to re-establish diplomatic relations with 21 countries and got the US an observer status in the [[United Nations]], stating that it would become a full member again only should the UN drop the demand for the US to pay war reparations. McCarthy did provide generous US help in trying to rehabilitate the starving and radiation-ridden remnants of the populations of \"The Victim Nations\" (the Soviet Union, Cuba, and former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries). However, shortly before the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]], a commission headed by [[Newt Gingrich]] (in his role as [[Archivist of the United States]]) presented to President McCarthy its recommendations \u2013 with the conclusion that the US would only be fully readmitted to the Family of Nations by adhering to the \"Geneva Convention of the Total Abolition of Nuclear Weapons\", already accepted by all other countries in the world.\n\n===[[Joseph McCarthy]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We Could Do Worse\" by [[Gregory Benford]], '''Joseph McCarthy''' was chosen in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] as the Republican vice presidential candidate by nominee [[Robert A. Taft]], a choice made with the tacit support of California Senator [[Richard Nixon]]. When Taft died on July 31, 1953 (as in real life), McCarthy became the 35th president. By the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 election]], when the story took place, he was well on his way to establishing a brutal dictatorship. The story indicates McCarthy would be re-elected with Nixon as his [[running mate]], using considerable voter intimidation provided by federal agents, and would \"diddle\" the [[United States Constitution]] to make his power permanent by [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. At some point during his first term, President McCarthy had placed [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Taft's Democratic opponent in 1952, under [[house arrest]] due to his alleged Communist sympathies. The story depicted two federal agents arresting a congressman named Garrett, a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]' Internal Security Committee who has proven to be a major thorn in McCarthy's side, on the trumped up charge that he was part of a Communist spy network. Shortly thereafter, Garrett was murdered. The arrest took place on August 20, 1956 while the first day of the [[1956 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] was being broadcast live on [[CBS]]. After being renominated by his party, President McCarthy was interviewed by [[Walter Cronkite]]. The two federal agents in question were grateful that Nixon delivered the California delegation to Taft at the [[1952 Republican National Convention|1952 Convention]] as it prevented [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a \"pinko general\" with a \"Kraut name,\" from securing the nomination. Furthermore, they regarded Taft's death as a godsend as it allowed McCarthy to accede to the presidency. In reality, McCarthy died of acute [[hepatitis]] on May 2, 1957. If the same is true of the version of McCarthy depicted in the story, it is possible that Nixon will succeed him as the 36th president only seven months after the 1956 election.\n\n===[[George B. McClellan]]===\n* '''George McClellan''' is President in ''[[Gray Victory]]'' by [[Robert Skimin]]. He was elected as the 17th president in [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] after [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] failed to take [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]], leading to Northern voters feeling fatigue with the never-ending [[American Civil War]]. Upon learning the result of the election, [[Abraham Lincoln]] orders an immediate cease-fire, which McClellan follows with peace negotiations and recognition of the [[Confederate States of America]] which accounted themselves as victors of the war. McClellan was sharply criticized by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] for having perpetuated slavery, and two years after his election a growing number of Americans are having second thoughts about having ended the war.\n\n===[[John William McCormack]]===\n* He was the 36th President of the United States in \"[[The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust]]\" (an essay in ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'') by [[Robert L. O'Connell]]. As [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], '''McCormack''' succeeded [[John F. Kennedy]] following a nuclear strike on [[Washington D.C.]] on Saturday, October 27, 1962 as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] escalated into the Two Days' War. A Russian SS-4 ([[R-12 Dvina]]) IRBM (launched from Cuba) detonated above the [[Lincoln Memorial]], leveling much of the surrounding area, including [[The White House]], taking with it Kennedy, Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and the rest of the [[National Command Authority]]. At nearly 71 upon assuming office, McCormack became the oldest serving president. Falling into ill health following his admirable handling of the crises that followed the war, he did not contest the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and was succeeded by the Republican victor [[Richard Nixon]], who became the 37th president.\n* In the alternative history novel ''Surrounded by Enemies: What if Kennedy Survived Dallas?'' by [[Bryce Zabel]], '''McCormack''' acceded to the presidency on February 24, 1966 after the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment, trial and removal from office]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]] for multiple incidents of extramarital affairs both before and during his term in office. As Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been forced to resign due to allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance, McCormack's position as Speaker of the House of Representatives meant that he was the first in the line of succession to the presidency under the provisions of the [[Presidential Succession Act|Presidential Succession Act 1947]]. For a time, it appeared that his Republican predecessor [[Gerald Ford]] would become president, but the Democrats gained a slim majority of 218-217 in the House of Representatives and McCormack once again became the Speaker. At 75 years old, he was the oldest man to take office as president. In March 1966, McCormack gave Kennedy a pardon for any crimes which he committed or may have committed while in office. He also announced that he would not run for election in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. He was succeeded by [[Richard Nixon]].\n\n===[[George McGovern]]===\n* In one of the episodes ''What If?'', program of [[Discovery Channel]], '''George McGovern''' was appointed vice president after [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] took office as the 38th president following the assassination of his predecessor [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in September 1969. After King was likewise assassinated in September 1971, McGovern became the 39th president.\n* He was also the subject of the novel ''President McGovern's First Term'' (1973) by [[Nicholas Max]].\n* In the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], two stories deal with '''McGovern''' winning the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]] and becoming the 38th president. In both stories, his vice president was [[Sargent Shriver]], the brother-in-law of [[John F. Kennedy]]. In \"Suppose They Gave a Peace...\" by [[Susan Shwartz]], McGovern wins when the youth vote turns out for him in droves, and is then blamed for the debacle that occurs when he swiftly withdraws US troops from [[South Vietnam]]. In \"Paper Trail\" by [[Brian Thomsen]], the tide turns for McGovern after reporter [[Carl Bernstein]], investigating a break-in at the [[Watergate complex]], is killed in a hit-and-run accident which is very quickly linked to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].\n* '''George McGovern''' was also elected in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] in one of the alternative timelines featured in [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s ''[[Fuzzy Dice]]''. In this case, he was narrowly elected after President [[Richard Nixon]] had undergone an assassination attempt and become completely paranoid, waging a crackdown on real and imagined domestic foes as well as a huge escalation of the [[Vietnam War]], and setting off a huge explosion of countrywide riots. Unfortunately, the riots continue and even increase after McGovern's election and a call by the new president for a return to calm proves completely ineffective. McGovern rejects a call in Congress to use the Army to quell the riots, leading to an attempted impeachment. Some military commanders try repression on their own, killing civilians and only adding to the ferocity of the riots. Eventually, the country is plunged into chaos, [[Second American Civil War|all-out civil war]], and eventually the total collapse of the Old Order. When the book's protagonist arrives some decades later, he finds a \"[[Hippie]]-style\" dictatorship presided over by the monstrous Lady Sunshine and with [[Hells Angels]] acting as the police, and the final fate of McGovern is unknown.\n* Although not actually specified, in ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' episode ''The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker'',  Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda travel back to March 15, 1972 and accidentally cause Denzel Crocker to lose his Fairy Godparents, who happen to be that time's counterparts to Cosmo and Wanda. As punishment, Jorgen Von Strangle forbids them from ever going to March 1972 again but tells them that they'll still be allowed to visit other months of that year on the proviso they won't ruin the [[1972 United States presidential election|election]] of \"'''President McGovern'''\". This suggests that Timmy was somehow responsible for McGovern's defeat or that Jorgen didn't know that George McGovern would lose the presidential election to Nixon.\n* In the short story, \"Hillary Orbits Venus\" by [[Pamela Sargent]], '''McGovern''' was elected in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] and [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]. During his term, he withdrew US troops from Vietnam and expanded funding to [[NASA]].\n\n===[[William McKinley]]===\n* In [[Ward Moore]]'s novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'', one of the time travelling characters in the alternative reality witnessed the victory of the Democratic candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]] where he had to resist the temptation of covering the confident bets made by '''McKinley's''' supporters, who were unaware that Bryan would go on to serve three terms as president. President Bryan was the candidate for both the Democratic Party and the [[Populist Party (US)|Populist Party]].\n* In the short story \"Plowshare\" by [[Martha Soukup]] in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[William Jennings Bryan]] was elected as the 25th president in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] over '''William McKinley'''. President Bryan ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] by granting full independence to [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Hawaii]]. Only 36 years old at the time of his election, he was the youngest man ever elected to the presidency. President Bryan served one term from 1897 to 1901, declining to run for re-election in [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] as he believed that presidents should only serve one term. In spite of this, in 1915, he revealed to the American public that he intended to prevent the expected Republican presidential nominee [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s plan to take the [[American entry into World War I|US into the Great War]] from coming to fruition by running against him and defeating him in the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]]. During his presidency, Bryan was a vocal supporter of [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], which was granted throughout the United States in 1913.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[1901 (novel)|1901]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''William McKinley''' died of a sudden heart attack in 1901 after being overwhelmed by the [[Imperial German plans for the invasion of the United States|invasion]] of [[Long Island]] by [[German Empire|Germany]]. He was succeeded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who became the 26th president and went on to win the war against Germany.\n* On the online timeline of the 2004 mockumentary ''[[CSA: The Confederate States of America]]'', '''William McKinley''' served as the [[President of the Confederate States of America]] from the late 1800s until 1901. According to the timeline, he was president during the alternate version of the [[Spanish-American War]], which sparked  a resurgence in the [[Manifest Destiny]] and the Confederacy's continued expansion south that would continue well into the 1920s and would include all of the [[Caribbean]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] as part of the nation's conquared territories. In 1901, McKinley was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] (as in reality). However, instead of being shot by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], he was instead killed by an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070115204823/http://www.csathemovie.com/timeline/index.html</ref>\n\n===[[Robert McNamara]]===\n* '''Robert McNamara''' served as the president in [[Thomas M. Disch]]'s 1968 science fiction novel ''[[Camp Concentration]]''.\n\n===[[James B. McPherson]]===\n* In ''[[If the South Had Won the Civil War]]'' by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], '''James McPherson''' survived and became President of United States for two terms in the 1880s. During his Second Inaugural Speech he strongly called for reconciliation with the [[Confederate States]], arguing that the war ending in 1863 saved the lives of many who would have been killed had it dragged on. This was warmly received south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], became part of the school curriculum and helped achieve an eventual reunification (though it only came long after his death). (In actual history, '''James McPherson''' was a Union officer who was killed in 1864; this did not happen in Kantor's alternative timeline, where the war ended in 1863 with a decisive Confederate victory.)\n\n===[[Andrew Mellon]]===\n* President in 1926, in the [[Alternative History]]/[[Time Travel]] story \"A Slip in Time\" by [[S. M. Stirling]],<ref>Published in \"Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014</ref> featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived. \n* The story, taking place in [[Vienna]], makes only a passing reference to  Mellon. In general, the alternative 1926 featured in the story has a worldwide trend favoring Conservative politicians  and regimes, the Presidency of the Conservative Republican Mellon being an evident part of this.\n\n===[[H. L. Mencken]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''H. L. Mencken''' served as the 19th president of the [[North American Confederacy]] from 1928 until his death in 1933. He killed his vice president in a duel and was subsequently killed himself by his vice president's mother. After his death, the [[Continental Congress]] choose [[Frank Chodorov]] as his successor.\n\n===[[Walter Mondale]]===\n* In the short story \"Huddled Masses\" by [[Lawrence Person]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Mondale''' defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 Presidential Election]] to become the 41st president. His vice president was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], who was the first woman to hold the office. As a result, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] movement expanded, causing a civil war in [[Mexico]]. This was followed by an invasion from the United States and a massive influx of [[Latin America]]n refugees into the [[southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\n* In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode \"The Best Christmas Story Never Told\", [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] went back in time and altered history. After defeating [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], '''Walter Mondale''' surrendered the United States to the [[Soviet Union]] after his 74th day in office.\n\n===[[James Monroe]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''James Monroe''' helps [[Albert Gallatin]] arrange the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, borrowing money from private sources against the value if the land. On July 4, 1826, he would become the 5th president following the death of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and would serve until his own death five years later on July 4, 1831.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternative history series, '''James Monroe''' served as the 5th president from March 4, 1817 to March 4, 1825, as he did in real life. He was from [[Virginia]], a trait which consigned his predecessors [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) in which the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. In spite of this, Monroe was looked upon kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote American security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. This doctrine was eviscerated in 1862 when, given the victory of the Confederacy, the US was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].\n* In Edward Baxter's short story \"The Disaster of '23\", the proclamation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1823 provoked an angry reaction by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Bourbon Restoration|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which declared war on the United States and imposed a devastating naval blockade on its shores. With the American economy in shambles, President '''James Monroe''' was eventually forced to capitulate, rescind his doctrine and officially recognize the right of European powers to intervene at their discretion in the affairs of the [[Americans|American continents]]. Monroe was subjected to impeachment proceedings for having brought this disaster upon the US. He narrowly survived the vote, but left the Presidency under a cloud, considered one of the worst Presidents in US history. In subsequent decades, the United States was increasingly weakened and reduced to a dependent status, with the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States|British]] and [[List of French ambassadors to the United States|French Ambassadors]] constantly and openly intervening in American elections and building up factions in Congress favorable to their countries' interests. The US was flooded with the products of European - particularly British - industry and never managed to build up its own industrial base. In 1917, [[Imperial Germany]] achieved a complete victory over Britain and France and became the dominant world power, the German Ambassador in Washington henceforward acting as a de facto military governor.\n\n===[[Marilyn Monroe]]===\n* In the short story \"A Dream Can Make A Difference\" by [[Beth Meacham]], contained in the anthology ''By Any Other Fame'', '''Marilyn Monroe''' survived her [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|drug overdose on August 5, 1962]] and subsequently entered politics. She was elected as the [[Governor of California]] in [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|1970]], defeating the Republican incumbent and her fellow former [[Hollywood]] star [[Ronald Reagan]]. She went on to be elected as the first female President of the United States in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] with [[Jimmy Carter]] as her [[running mate]]. After only 69 days in office, President Monroe was [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassinated in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 1981]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] as the culmination of an effort to impress [[Jodie Foster]]. She was succeeded by Carter. After [[William Henry Harrison]], who died on his 32nd day in office on April 4, 1841, she was the second shortest-serving president in US history.\n\n===[[Thomas More]]===\n* '''Thomas More''' served as President in the story \"The New Utopia\" by Bernard C. Cowper. In 2096, he was brought out of the past \u2013 taken out of the very moment of his beheading by order of [[Henry VIII of England]] and a perfect simulacrum placed in his place, the substitution being invisible to 16th Century people. Given a crash course in the history of the past five hundred years and offered the Presidency of the United States, as a desperate last measure to stop the complete demoralizing and breakdown of society \u2013 which he accepts after prolonged pondering. Voted unanimously into office by all voters who bother to show up at the polls \u2013 which is less than four percent of the American citizen body. The ambiguous ending leaves unclear whether or not he succeeded in his efforts to reverse the degeneration of American society and create the New Utopia of the title.\n\n===[[Gouverneur Morris]]===\n* President in: \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade.\n* In the story, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the Royal Navy ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being killed by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing New York City to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to [[George Washington]] as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The Constitutional Convention, held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a Senate whose members would likewise sit for life, and a House of Representatives elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. '''Gouverneur Morris''', originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale civil war. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n\n===[[Charlie Murphy]]===\n* President in: ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', episode #110\n* Vice President under [[Dave Chappelle]]; becomes president when President Chapelle goes missing during his third term.\n\n==N==\n===[[Ralph Nader]]===\n* President in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit ''A Glimpse of Our Possible Future III'' (2000), played by [[Jimmy Fallon]].\n\n===[[Richard Nixon]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[If Israel Lost the War]]'' by [[Robert Littell (author)|Robert Littell]], [[Richard Z.

As [[Sirhan Sirhan]] returned home to Jordan to celebrate the conquest of Israel, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was never [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] and went on to defeat '''Richard Nixon''' in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], becoming the 37th president.\n* In [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[The Psychotechnic League]]'', Vice President '''Richard Nixon''' succeeded as the 35th president in June 1956, following the death of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from surgical complications. Becoming president as a relatively young man of 43, only a few years removed from his active participation in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and with his anti-Communist zeal untampered by the pragmatism he might have gained in later life, Nixon embarked on a wild, provocative and confrontational policy. This resulted by 1958 in a worldwide [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], in which President Nixon himself was killed along with hundreds of millions of other people.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] known as the [[North American Confederacy]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a small-time criminal in [[California]] in 1986.\n* In ''[[Making History (novel)|Making History]]'' by [[Stephen Fry]], the protagonist Michael Young and physicist Leo Zuckerman (born Axel Bauer) accidentally created an [[hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|alternate reality wherein the Axis Powers won the Second World War]] by preventing Hitler's conception in the hope of preventing the Second World War and the [[Holocaust]]. In this reality, whereby Hitler is replaced with the more effective Rudolph Gloder, a more socially conservative United States locked in a Cold War with the Third Reich, with '''Richard Nixon''' being mentioned as having served three terms between 1960 and 1972.\n* In the [[time travel]] short story \"Hindsight\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon's presidency]] was fictionalized two decades before the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972\u20131974) in the 1953 novel ''Watergate'' by Michelle Gordian, a time traveler from the early 1980s who wrote [[science fiction]] stories under the pseudonym \"Mark Gordian.\" The novel was critically acclaimed and was compared to ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] publicly criticized ''Watergate'' which Pete Lundquist, a science fiction writer from [[California]], believed spoke well of it. As '''Nixon''' was serving as vice president under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1953, Gordian referred to him as \"'''President Cavanaugh'''\" in the novel.\n* In ''[[Watchmen]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' was on his fifth term as president after winning the [[Vietnam War]] in 1985 and making [[Vietnam]] the 51st state of the Union. He is challenged for re-election by [[Robert Redford]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n* In the alternative history ''[[Dark Future]]'' novel series by [[Kim Newman]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] after it was discovered that Kennedy was having an affair with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Under Nixon's leadership, the Solid Sixties were seen as a golden age of peace, stability and decent moral values in the United States. Legal restrictions were removed from businesses, allowing for both technological advancement and ending regulations against pollution. Racial strife was considered to be ended by the [[separate but equal]] laws. He was succeeded by [[Barry Goldwater]].\n* In the alternative history short story \"We Could Do Worse\" by [[Gregory Benford]], Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] secured the Republican presidential nomination at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]], narrowly beating General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], with the support of the [[California]] delegation which was delivered by '''Richard Nixon'''. In the [[1952 United States presidential election|election the following November]], Taft defeated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and was inaugurated as the 34th president on January 20, 1953. However, after only six months in office, President Taft died of a heart attack on July 31, 1953, as occurred in reality. He was succeeded by his vice president [[Joseph McCarthy]]. By the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 election]], when the story takes place, President McCarthy was well on his way to establishing a brutal dictatorship. The story indicates McCarthy would be re-elected with Nixon as his [[running mate]], using considerable voter intimidation provided by federal agents, and would \"diddle\" the [[United States Constitution]] to make his power permanent by [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. Two federal agents, the principal characters of the story, were grateful for Nixon's part in facilitating the late President Taft's nomination as it prevented Eisenhower, a \"pinko general\" with a \"Kraut name\", from being elected president. In reality, McCarthy died of acute [[hepatitis]] on May 2, 1957. If the same is true of the version of McCarthy depicted in the story, it is possible that Nixon will succeed him as the 36th president less than seven months after the 1956 election.\n* In the alternative timeline created by [[Biff Tannen]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', the May 23, 1983 edition of the ''Hill Valley Telegraph'' carries the story that '''Richard Nixon''' intends to run for a fifth term in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], having seemingly been re-elected in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] with Biff's support. He pledges to successfully conclude the [[Vietnam War]] by 1985, a reference to the events of ''Watchmen''. Once the proper timeline is restored, the story is replaced by one which states that [[Ronald Reagan]] intends to run for a second term in 1984.\n* In the short story \"The Impeachment of Adlai Stevenson\" by [[David Gerrold]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], the [[Adlai Stevenson II|title character]] defeated [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] after Eisenhower made the mistake of choosing [[Joseph McCarthy]] as his [[running mate]] instead of '''Richard Nixon'''. However, Stevenson proved to be an extremely unpopular president, leading to his impeachment and subsequent resignation in August 1958. Stevenson is succeeded by his untested 41-year-old vice-president [[John F. Kennedy]]. Although the story ends immediately after Stevenson has decided to resign, it is heavily implied that Nixon, already the front runner for the next Republican nomination, will defeat Kennedy in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and become the 36th president. This is due both to the public's antipathy towards the Democrats and the fact that Kennedy is a much derided figure due to his recent marriage to the Hollywood actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], referred to derisively as \"the new [[Monroe Doctrine]].\"\n* In the short story \"Heavy Metal\" by [[Barry N. Malzberg]], also contained in the anthology ''Alternate Presidents'' by Mike Resnick, '''Richard Nixon''' was elected as the 35th president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] following a feud between [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard J. Daley]]. He won [[1960 United States presidential election in Illinois|Illinois]] and, consequently, the election by 240,000 votes. He succeeded [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], under whom he had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961. His own vice president was [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]].\n* In the short story \"Fellow Americans\" by [[Eileen Gunn]], also contained in the anthology ''Alternate Presidents'' by Mike Resnick, [[Barry Goldwater]] defeated the early favorite and incumbent [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] and went on to be re-elected in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. During his term in office, President Goldwater ordered that [[nuclear weapon]]s be deployed against [[North Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Following his \"[[Richard Nixon's last press conference|last press conference]]\" on November 7, 1962 immediately after his defeat in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|1962 California gubernatorial election]] to the Democratic incumbent [[Pat Brown]], '''Richard Nixon''' retired from politics. As President Goldwater had never liked nor trusted [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s former vice president, he was pleased that Nixon had never acceded to the nation's highest office. However, Nixon re-entered the public sphere in an entirely different context eight years later. Despite an uneasy relationship with the media dating back to the [[Checkers speech]] during the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election campaign]], he parlayed his electoral defeat into television success and was given a [[late-night talk show]] entitled ''Tricky Dick'' (referring to his most famous political nickname) on [[NBC]] in 1970. Much to Goldwater's annoyance, the series garnered high ratings from its inception and, by 1990, was still as popular as ever despite being on its twentieth season. He believed that it was time for the 77-year-old Nixon to retire from television as well as politics. At the beginning of every episode, Nixon made the [[V sign]], which became his trademark. Much of Nixon's continued popularity was attributed to his use of [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]] as he frequently made jokes about his defeat by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and the perceived ineffectual nature of the office of vice president. In a 1990 edition of ''Tricky Dick'' in which he was supposedly connected to a [[lie detection|lie detector]], he admitted that he and his wife [[Pat Nixon]] had tried [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] in 1965 (before it was made illegal) which they had obtained from a [[Hollywood]] couple. After taking the LSD, Nixon imagined himself to be a [[submarine]] whereas his wife cried at the thought of all of the music trapped inside their [[piano]]. Long resident in Hollywood, the Nixon's owned a luxurious [[yacht]] and frequently entertained various actors and politicians on the boat. For instance, they maintained a friendship with Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] and his wife [[Marilyn Quayle]]. While the two couples relaxed in the yacht's [[hot tub]], Nixon learned that it was Quayle's ambition to one day send a [[manned mission to Mars]], though President [[George H. W. Bush]] was considerably more skeptical about its viability.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Richard \"Honest Dick\" Nixon''' was a prosperous used-[[Steam car|steamer]] salesman in the [[North American Union]] city of [[Los Angeles|New Liverpool]]. He was the murdered by the [[Sons of Liberty]], a terrorist organisation, as a distraction during the theft of the [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painting ''[[The Two Georges]]'' from the [[Governor-General]]'s mansion in June 1995. Shockingly, his murder was the fifth by gunfire in New Liverpool since the beginning of the year.\n* In the alternative history novel ''Branch Point'' by [[Mona Clee]], '''Richard Nixon''' was assassinated during the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election campaign]], as were Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] and Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. Running as the [[American Independent Party]] candidate, [[George Wallace]], the former [[Governor of Alabama]], won the election that November and became the 37th president. His vice president was the retired [[United States Air Force|USAF]] General [[Curtis LeMay]].\n* In the alternative history anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'' by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]], '''Richard Nixon''' was the fourth president of the United Socialist States of America (USSA), succeeding [[Barry Goldwater]]. Nixon served as a parallel to [[Leonid Brezhnev]], as Goldwater was this world's version of [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n* In the television series ''[[Futurama]]'', '''Nixon's head''' (like the heads of other public figures from the viewers' past and present) has been preserved in a jar of H2OG fat liquid. In the episode \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\", Nixon is elected as the President of Earth in the year 3000. Nixon appears as president in several later episodes, such as \"[[Time Keeps On Slippin']]\" and \"[[A Taste of Freedom]]\". He was re-elected president in \"[[Decision 3012]]\".\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[Colonization: Down to Earth]]'' as part of the [[Worldwar series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a congressman who represented [[California]]. In 1963, Liu Han, a leading member of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], lobbied Nixon and a number of other members of Congress for military aid for his party's resistance against the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s colonization of [[China]]. Congressman Nixon was hesitant to support a [[communist party]] due to his ardent [[anti-communism]] but was convinced to acquiesce when Liu Han bluntly told him, \"You help us, you help people go free from Lizards.\"\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] but was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963]].\n* In one of the alternative timelines featured in [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s ''[[Fuzzy Dice]]'', during the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]] campaign, [[Arthur Bremer]] attempted to kill '''President Nixon''' rather than [[George Wallace]]. The assassination attempt drove Nixon into an increasingly paranoid crackdown on real and imagined domestic foes as well as a huge escalation of the [[Vietnam War]], setting off a huge explosion of countrywide riots. A few weeks before the elections, Nixon proclaimed [[martial law]] \u2013 which only escalated the riots and caused the narrow victory of [[George McGovern]]. Nixon died of a stroke at the conclusion of a hate-filled farewell speech. In later centuries, he was remembered as a satanic figure, \"The Weasel\".\n* In another timeline mentioned in Di Filippo's same book, '''Richard Nixon''' single-handedly saved the Earth from an [[alien invasion]] by letting himself be abducted and experimented upon by extraterrestrials, and was for many centuries thereafter venerated worldwide as \"The Savior\".\n* In the [[counterfactual history]] essay \"Cuban Crisis: Second Holocaust\" by [[Robert L. O'Connell]] contained in the anthology ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' was elected in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He succeeded [[John William McCormack]] as the 37th president, two years after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] escalated into [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], in which [[Washington, D.C.]] was destroyed and the US retaliated drastically by totally destroying the [[Soviet Union]] and Cuba, killing 90% of their populations. He became president at a time when the United States was being internationally accused of having perpetrated [[genocide]], the \"Second [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\" of the title. Nixon won the election after a famous \"nothing to be ashamed of\" speech, and completely refused any suggestion at nuclear disarmament of the US even though its Soviet foe no longer existed. He presided over the disintegration of [[NATO]], from which all members but the US withdrew, and expelled the [[United Nations]] from [[New York City]] after all other members of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] unanimously condemned the US. Nixon declared the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]] \"a referendum on national security\" but was defeated with a huge margin by [[Eugene McCarthy]], who promised \"global reconciliation and healing\".\n* In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the comic book ''[[newuniversal]]'' by [[Warren Ellis]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[Settling Accounts: The Grapple]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a soldier in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] (1941\u20131944) who was a specialist in sweeping for [[surveillance]] equipment. He was stationed in [[Philadelphia]] in 1943. His immediate superior was Sgt. [[Carl Bernstein]].\n* In the parallel universe featured in ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', '''Richard Nixon's''' portrait was used on the [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar coins]]. Furthermore, there was a Nixon Parkway in [[Manhattan|Manhatan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''The Man Who Prevented WW2'' by [[Roy Carter]], '''Richard Nixon''' was elected president in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]]. His predecessor was [[Thomas E. Dewey]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''Surrounded by Enemies: What if Kennedy Survived Dallas?'' by [[Bryce Zabel]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated his Democratic opponent Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] of [[Maine]] in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], becoming the 37th president. His immediate predecessor was [[John William McCormack]], who acceded to the presidency on February 24, 1966 following the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment, trial and removal from office]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In November 1969, Nixon reluctantly invited Kennedy to meet the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]. Nixon was re-elected in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] but was impeached himself during his second term. He was succeeded by [[Ronald Reagan]].\n* In Caroline Weinbaum's short story \"Mired up in the Cuban War\", '''Richard Nixon''' defeated Kennedy in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and was elected President. Nixon was infuriated by the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961 and decided to send the US Army on a full-scale direct invasion of Cuba. American troops met stiff resistance but after half a year managed to occupy [[Havana]] and the other main Cuban cities. [[Fidel Castro]] was killed in battle with the invaders, with a heroic myth growing around what many Cubans considered as his martyrdom. A government composed of anti-Communist Cuban exiles was installed, but enjoyed little credibility or popular support. [[Che Guevara]] escaped and launched a highly effective guerrilla campaign, inflicting heavy losses on the American forces. Guevara then managed to extend the war, secretly travelling to [[Puerto Rico]] and touching off a rebellion there, too. The Puerto Rican revolt first involved only radical groups, but brutal moves made in an effort to stamp it out aroused the sympathy of more and more Puerto Ricans. Soon, the Cuban War became extremely unpopular in the US, students and members of Hispanic communities engaging in increasingly massive demonstrations and protests. The tensions were increased by President Nixon's hostility to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and his almost open backing for Southern racists. In April 1963, [[Martin Luther King]] held a dramatic meeting with Che Guevara at [[Geneva]], declaring his support for the Cuban liberation struggle and calling for immediate withdrawal of American troops. On his return, King was arrested and the furious Nixon declared that \"He will be charged with High Treason, and the prosecution will seek the death penalty!\". There followed a nationwide wave of demonstrations and protests - answered by the FBI arresting overnight more than a thousand student activists and black and Hispanic leaders, many of them being beaten up and three killed \"while resisting arrest\". In the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], held under conditions near to [[Second American Civil War|civil war]], Nixon was decisively defeated and [[John Kennedy]] swept to power by a landslide. Nixon, bitter and angry, refused to hold a formal handover, leaving the White House in total chaos a few days ahead of Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy announced an immediate ceasefire and called for negotiations with the Cuban and Puerto Rican rebels, as well as pardoning King and other detainees. With the American public hopeful of an end to the Cuban nightmare, hardly any attention was given to the fall of [[South Vietnam]] in April 1965 and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s triumphal entry into [[Saigon]]; most Americans did not know or care where or what [[Vietnam]] was.     \n* In one of the alternative history timelines featured in Claire North's \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\", in which technological development was much accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s due to the intervention of a fanatic time-traveler, President '''Richard Nixon''' announced that a pill turning the skin of black people inro white would be the ultimate solution to the race problem. This being a minor point in the book's overall plot, there is no detailed description of how Nixon's idea worked out in practice.\n* In the film ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', a 2004 [[mockumentary]] directed by [[Kevin Willmott]] which depicts a timeline in which the Confederacy won the [[American Civil War]], completely annexed and absorbed the United States, and perpetuated [[slavery]]. By [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], when only 29 percent of voters approve of slavery, Democratic candidate '''Richard Nixon''' was defeated by [[Roman Catholic]] Republican candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]. On the online timeline of the film, it is reveled that Nixon is elected Confederate President in his own right. During his presidency, Nixon [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|travels to China in 1972]] (the first time a Confederate President would do so). His talks with the [[China|Chinese]] government would open the way for Confederate-run labor camps to be run in China, which results in cheaper goods being made and imported from China. However, that year on June 17, five men were caught placing wire taps at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate Hotel]] in order to spy on the Confederate National Committee. As the investigation wore on, it became clear that the orders came from high-up. How high up was unclear until a mysterious anonymous source, using the code name \u201cDark Throat\u201d, tipped off the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] that Nixon gave the orders to place the taps. Under pressure from the press and the CBI investigation of the [[Watergate scandal]] Nixon was forced to resign from the presidency on August 8, 1974 (as in real life). During his [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|resignation speech]] he reminded the public, \u201cI am not a Negro!\u201d. Still, years from the event, the mystery surrounding the informant \u201cDark Throat\u201d is still speculated about. The most popular theory is that one of the White House slaves had overheard the President, and turn against Nixon by turning him in to the CBI. With the penalty of slaves turning against their masters in the Confederacy being death, it is unlikely the informant would ever even be known.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070305183703/http://www.csathemovie.com/timeline/moreinfo/nixon.html </ref>\n\n===[[Albert Jay Nock]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L.

[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] proceeded to invade [[Australia]]. After the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]] liberated North Australia whereas the United States liberated South Australia. While the United States rebuilt their portion of Australia, the Soviets continued their occupation of North Australia and created a [[communist state]]. In the early 1990s, the Australian War broke out when North Australia attacked South Australia. '''President North''' unofficially joined the war to prevent the fall of South Australia to North Australia, which was backed militarily by the Soviet Union. As the war dragged on with no sign of either victory or peaceful resolution, it became increasingly unpopular in the United States and, by 1995, the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]], centered in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of [[San Francisco]], had spread throughout the US and beyond.\n* In a parallel universe featured in the ''Sliders'' Season Three episodes \"The Exodus, Part I\" and \"The Exodus, Part II\", '''North''' was the president in 1997.

In May 2009, Obama, his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] and their daughters [[Family of Barack Obama#Immediate family|Malia and Sasha]] were preparing to move into the recently rebuilt [[White House]]. The original version of the traditional presidential residence had been destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] perpetrated by [[al-Qaeda]] whereas [[the Pentagon]] had been severely damaged. In contrast, the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] remained standing.\n* In ''Franz Ferdinand Lives! A World Without World War I'' (2014) by [[Richard Ned Lebow]] in which neither [[World War I]] nor [[World War II]] took place, '''Obama''' was elected [[Governor of Hawaii]] in 2008 and served two highly successful terms. In the 1990s, because of the US-Japanese Cold War, many demanded that [[Japanese people|Japanese]] residents and [[Japanese American]]s be either detained or deported. Following a riot in [[Los Angeles]], the Republican president announced that everyone of Japanese descent had 30 days to leave the country. Those with [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] were allowed to remain but were ordered to report to transport to detention camps until tensions subsided. Governor Obama considered these measures to be gross overreactions and called upon the government to make public any evidence that it had of a security threat posed by people of Japanese descent. The [[United States Attorney General]] refused to do so on the grounds of national security and did not respond to Obama's request to be briefed on camera. In response, Obama set his plan in motion: Japanese Americans were invited to turn themselves in, take up residence in resort hotels along [[Oahu]]'s [[Waikiki|Waikiki Beach]] and limit their movement to Waikiki and [[Honolulu]]'s immediate downtown. Other civic groups organised a \"Parade of Freedom\" in which citizens of diverse ancestry peacefully demonstrated their support for the [[United States Constitution]] and its guarantees against detention without charge. A small counter-demonstration ensued but public opinion overwhelmingly supported Governor Obama. The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] threatened to expel all Americans from [[Japan]] and arrest a prominent businessman and his wife on charges of spying. Evidence of the couple's activities is given to the press and the American media became divided over whether the couple were truly spies or were being set up. Obama insisted that the federal government foot the bill for room and board at resort hotels for Japanese Americans. The president considered sending the [[Hawaii National Guard]] to clear the hotels and move the Japanese Americans to a detention camp. Students, religious leaders and other citizens held round-the-clock visits at the hotels, meaning that any military action would have involved arresting them and further alienating the state's population. Consequently, the president backed down and negotiated a compromise agreement whereby Japanese tourists and expatriates would be quietly repatriated and Japanese residents would be allowed to return to their homes in Hawaii. However, militarily sensitive areas in the state were declared off-limits. Relations with Japan gradually improved and, in the interim, none of its citizens were arrested or charged with a crime.\n* In the first episode of [[The Last Ship (TV series)|The Last Ship]], '''Barack Obama''' succumbed to the Red Flu shortly after the breakout of the disease. Following his death, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] succeeded him before he too succumbed to the disease a week later. After Biden's death, he was replaced by President August, the former fictitious [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], who delivers the news via teleconference to the ''[[USS Nathan James]]''. Although neither he nor Obama are mentioned by name in the series, a printed news article in the Season 2 episode \"Safe Zone\" shows Obama as the incumbent President before the outbreak, meeting with the newly appointed [[Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] Jeffery Michener (who also goes on to serve as president later in the series).\n\n===[[Family of Barack Obama#Immediate family|Malia Obama]]===\n* '''Malia Obama''' is President in 2035 in the series finale of ''[[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|Life On Mars]]''. Frank Morgan at [[Mission Control]] stated that she had gone with her sister to [[Chicago]] to be with their ailing father [[Barack Obama]] rather than witness humans landing on [[Mars]] at Mission Control. Although not specifically identified, Malia would meet the minimum age requirement of 35 by 2033, assuming no changes to the [[Constitution of the United States]] or the [[United States presidential line of succession]] before July 4, 2033 by being at most [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].\n\n===[[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen|Twin Presidents Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]]===\n* '''The Olsen Twins''' are mentioned as both being President, though not seen by the Ghost of Christmas Future in ''[[A Dennis the Menace Christmas]]''.\n* Never seen, but mentioned by the Ghost of Christmas Future.\n\n===[[Osceola]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''Osceola''' served as the 9th President of the [[North American Confederacy]] from 1842 to 1848. After [[Sequoyah|Sequoyah Guess]], he was the second [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to hold the office of the presidency.\n\n===[[Lee Harvey Oswald]]===\nIn Lilian W. Berger's novelette ''The Great Chaos'', '''Lee Harvey Oswald''' was only lightly wounded by [[Jack Ruby]]'s bullet, and was duly prosecuted and sentenced to death for murdering President Kennedy. However, the execution was delayed by repeated appeals, and meanwhile the United States fell apart. The assassination of President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1965 was followed by mass rioting, armed incidents and attempted military coups, by 1966 degenerating into a full-fledged, multilateral [[Second Civil War]]. In July 1966 a radical militia stormed the prison and set Oswald free, declaring his killing Kennedy to have been \"a most praiseworthy act, ridding the country of a despicable \u00a0tyrant\". A coalition of Black Nationalists and radical whites which took over [[Memphis, Tennessee]] proclaimed \u00a0[[Malcolm X]] as President of the United States and Oswald as his Vice President. When Malcolm X was killed during a skirmish with a unit of US Marines trying to take over Memphis, Oswald was declared President - one of six rival Presidents at different locations in US\u00a0territory and two others among the army in South\u00a0Vietnam.\u00a0 During seven months as an Acting President, his authority recognized mainly in Memphis and to a lesser degree in the rest of Tennessee and Kentucky, Oswald strove to widen his base of support, restrain the more wild and unruly pf followers, and prevent ugly incidents breaking out between Black and White militias, despite both being outspokenly opposed to racism. Concerned at news of [[Richard Nixon]] consolidating a harsh dictatorial regime in [[California]], gaining possession of tanks and fighter planes and extending his power eastwards, Osward renounced his claim to the Presidency and threw his support behind [[Eugene McCarthy]], who was\u00a0proclaimed President in New York City and gained support along much of the East Coast. However, before he could depart for a summit with McCarthy, Oswald was assassinated by the most radical faction of the Memphis Liberation Front, which accused him of \"Selling out\". After the Reunification of 1979, President [[Jane Fonda]] and Vice President [[Allen Ginsberg]] inaugurated a memorial plaque to Oswald: \"It was a time of terrible national madness and Oswald was one of those who launched the madness - but when he had the chance, he tried to act sanely and sensibly, which cannot be said of many others\" said President\u00a0Fonda.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Lists of US Presidents and Vice Presidents}}\n{{Fictional government navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States Fictional Presidencies Of Historical Figures (M-O), List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional Presidents of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{more citations needed|date=June 2013}}{{more footnotes|date=June 2013}}{{original research|date=June 2013}}{{one source|date=June 2013}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=Too much detail; needs to be resectioned by person|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n{{FictionalPotus}}\nThe following is a list of real or historical people who have been portrayed as [[President of the United States]] in fiction, although they did not hold the office in real life.

Beam Piper]], '''James Madison''' was a major participant in the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] in the colonies of the [[British North America]] in the 1770s. In 1809, he was living in exile in [[Switzerland]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence, Madison was the current [[President of the United States]] in 1809 and was preceded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the author of the American rebels' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Philadelphia]].\n* In the short story \"The War of '07\" by [[Jayge Carr]] in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''James Madison''' served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in the cabinet of [[Aaron Burr]], who became the 3rd president after defeating [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 election]].\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s alternative history series ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'', '''James Madison''' served as the 4th president from March 4, 1809 to March 4, 1817, as he did in real life. Due to his [[Virginia]] heritage as well as his [[Anti-Federalism|anti-Federalist]] views, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of history taught in the United States after the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. Many in the United States presumed that Cassius Madison, the 16-year-old Confederate black boy who had killed [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate States President]] [[Jake Featherston]] on July 7, 1944, had taken his surname in honor of President Madison. In fact, Cassius had taken it from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he had gunned down Featherston. He had never even heard of Madison before he began his tour of the United States after the end of the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] (1941\u20131944).\n* In the 1988 short story ''[[The Reploids]]'' by [[Stephen King]], Edward Paladin, who is revealed to be the counterpart of [[Johnny Carson]] as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)#Stranger in a strange land|parallel universe]], has a deep-blue [[United States one-dollar bill]] in his wallet with '''James Madison''' on it, implying that he served as the first president of the United States instead of [[George Washington]] in Paladin's universe.\n* In the short story ''Hamilton vs. Napoleon'' by Elizabeth Bennet, [[Alexander Hamilton]] announces in June 1804 that he would not fight a [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|duel]] with [[Aaron Burr]]. '''James Madison''' is defeated for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] nomination in 1808 by Burr, who in turn was defeated by Hamilton in the [[1808 United States presidential election|general election]].\n\n===[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]===\n* In the alternative history novels ''[[The Great War: Walk in Hell]]'' and ''[[American Empire: Blood and Iron]]'', part of the [[Southern Victory Series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Alfred Thayer Mahan''' is mentioned as having served as president from 1889 to 1897. Mahan's place in the pantheon of \"great US presidents\" was assured when he forced the [[Confederate States of America]] to abandon its proposal to build a [[Nicaragua Canal|canal]] in [[Nicaragua]]. President Mahan was credited with the observation that the main problem with republics is that \"over time, the voters are apt to get tired of paying for what their country needs to defend itself.\" He was succeeded by [[Thomas Brackett Reed]], who served as president from 1897 until he died in office in 1902.\n\n===[[George Marshall]]===\n* President in \"[[Thor Meets Captain America]]\", 1987 novelette by [[David Brin]]\n* Mentioned as being president in 1962, three years after his death in real life.\n\n===[[Thomas R. Marshall]]===\n* In the 1953 alternate history novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' by [[Ward Moore]], '''Thomas Marshall''' is elected president in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]] as candidate for the Populist Party. He is then defeated for reelection in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] by [[William Hale Thompson]].\n* In the short story ''Peace in Our Times'' by Edith F. Milner, following the severe stroke which in October 1919 completely incapacitated President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a group of Congressional leaders initiated a  joint resolution of both Houses calling upon Vice President '''Thomas Marshall''' to assume full power as [[Acting President]], \"Until such time as the President is able to take up his duties again\". In the event, Marshall retained power until the end of Wilson's term - an effort by First Lady [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith Wilson]] to have her husband resume his duties when his condition improved a bit failing when doctors examined Wilson and unanimously found him \"still far too weak\". The most urgent issue on Marshall's agenda was to secure the United States' adherence to the [[League of Nations]] and overcome the strong opposition on Capitol Hill. Opponents especially attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country's return to war without an act of Congress. Negotiating with European leaders, Marshall secured a change making that contentious tenth article non-binding. He then managed to let US adherence to the League of Nations be ratified after a long and tense Congressional debate, including several filibusters. The debate confirmed Marshall's reputation as a strong, decisive leader, and in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] he easily gained the Democratic nomination and swept to power, with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] as his running mate. Marshall took a strong anti-[[isolationist]] line, declaring at his inauguration: \"For a hundred years we Americans deluded ourselves that wide oceans divide us from the wider world and that we can afford to turn a blind eye to the problems of other continents. But that egg was shattered to small pieces on the day when [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania was sunk]], and no amount of hand-wringing can put it back together again. When we went to war, the United States had taken on a decisive responsibility for the fate of Europe, of the entire world. We cannot shrug off this responsibility once our boys have come home again. We dare not - lest a new generation of American boys, twenty years hence, be asked to shed their blood on European soil all over again!\". In his term, Marshall took considerable effort to consolidate an anti-isolationist bloc in Congress, often intervening in various Congressional races. In Europe, he put considerable pressure on British and French leaders to soften the more harsh terms imposed on Germany in the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It was especially due to him that Germany was allowed to stop paying war reparations in 1925, shortly before Marshall's death. Franklin Roosevelt, who succeeded to the Presidency and was re-elected in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], continued Marshall's policy, which eventually became a bi-partisan policy followed by all Presidents in the following decades. As part of this policy of \"American Vigilance Over the Peace of Europe\", in January 1933 the American Ambassador to Berlin informally but firmly cautioned German President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] against appointing \"an irresponsible firebrand\" named [[Adolf Hitler]] as German Chancellor. The warning was seconded by the British and French Ambassadors. Although leaked to some sensational papers, who complained of \"American interference in German internal affairs\", the allegations were denied by the State Department and the German Presidential Bureau alike. Hitler eventually dropped from view, failing to secure re-election to the German Parliament. In 2020, large scale celebrations were held in [[Geneva]] to mark the League of Nations Centenary. World leaders gathered to unveil a giant statue of Thomas Marshall, the inscription reading \"The Family of Nations will ever cherish the memory of the Great Pioneer, whose Strong Leadership helped give Humanity a Century of Peace\".\n\n===[[John McCain]]===\n* In the [[future history]] [[graphic novel]] ''[[Shooting War]]'' by [[Anthony Lapp\u00e9]], '''McCain''' was president in 2011.\n* In the ''[[Treehouse of Horror XIX]]'' episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Homer attempts to vote for [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] but his electronic voting machine registers his multiple attempts to do so as six votes for McCain; upon realizing that the machine is rigged, Homer attempts to head out to report the mishap, but the machine sucks him in and kills him to hide the truth.\n\n===[[Eugene McCarthy]]===\n* President in Robert O'Connel's \"Cuban Crisis: Second Holocaust\". He was elected as the 38th president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], in the long aftermath of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962 which escalated into [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The US reacted drastically to the destruction of [[Washington, D.C.]] by totally destroying the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] and killing some 90% of their populations. It was subsequently accused of having perpetrated [[genocide]]. [[Richard Nixon]], who as elected as the 37th president in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], had driven the US into complete international isolation and made it a [[pariah state|pariah nation]]. '''McCarthy''' soundly defeated the incumbent Nixon in 1968, promising \"global reconciliation and healing\" and winning no less than 76% of the popular vote. McCarthy's success as president was only partial. He did reduce the American nuclear arsenal but refused to completely dispose of it, which the rest of the world found inadequate. He did manage to re-establish diplomatic relations with 21 countries and got the US an observer status in the [[United Nations]], stating that it would become a full member again only should the UN drop the demand for the US to pay war reparations. McCarthy did provide generous US help in trying to rehabilitate the starving and radiation-ridden remnants of the populations of \"The Victim Nations\" (the Soviet Union, Cuba, and former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries). However, shortly before the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]], a commission headed by [[Newt Gingrich]] (in his role as [[Archivist of the United States]]) presented to President McCarthy its recommendations \u2013 with the conclusion that the US would only be fully readmitted to the Family of Nations by adhering to the \"Geneva Convention of the Total Abolition of Nuclear Weapons\", already accepted by all other countries in the world.\n\n===[[Joseph McCarthy]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We Could Do Worse\" by [[Gregory Benford]], '''Joseph McCarthy''' was chosen in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] as the Republican vice presidential candidate by nominee [[Robert A. Taft]], a choice made with the tacit support of California Senator [[Richard Nixon]]. When Taft died on July 31, 1953 (as in real life), McCarthy became the 35th president. By the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 election]], when the story took place, he was well on his way to establishing a brutal dictatorship. The story indicates McCarthy would be re-elected with Nixon as his [[running mate]], using considerable voter intimidation provided by federal agents, and would \"diddle\" the [[United States Constitution]] to make his power permanent by [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. At some point during his first term, President McCarthy had placed [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Taft's Democratic opponent in 1952, under [[house arrest]] due to his alleged Communist sympathies. The story depicted two federal agents arresting a congressman named Garrett, a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]' Internal Security Committee who has proven to be a major thorn in McCarthy's side, on the trumped up charge that he was part of a Communist spy network. Shortly thereafter, Garrett was murdered. The arrest took place on August 20, 1956 while the first day of the [[1956 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] was being broadcast live on [[CBS]]. After being renominated by his party, President McCarthy was interviewed by [[Walter Cronkite]]. The two federal agents in question were grateful that Nixon delivered the California delegation to Taft at the [[1952 Republican National Convention|1952 Convention]] as it prevented [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a \"pinko general\" with a \"Kraut name,\" from securing the nomination. Furthermore, they regarded Taft's death as a godsend as it allowed McCarthy to accede to the presidency. In reality, McCarthy died of acute [[hepatitis]] on May 2, 1957. If the same is true of the version of McCarthy depicted in the story, it is possible that Nixon will succeed him as the 36th president only seven months after the 1956 election.\n\n===[[George B. McClellan]]===\n* '''George McClellan''' is President in ''[[Gray Victory]]'' by [[Robert Skimin]]. He was elected as the 17th president in [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] after [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] failed to take [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]], leading to Northern voters feeling fatigue with the never-ending [[American Civil War]]. Upon learning the result of the election, [[Abraham Lincoln]] orders an immediate cease-fire, which McClellan follows with peace negotiations and recognition of the [[Confederate States of America]] which accounted themselves as victors of the war. McClellan was sharply criticized by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] for having perpetuated slavery, and two years after his election a growing number of Americans are having second thoughts about having ended the war.\n\n===[[John William McCormack]]===\n* He was the 36th President of the United States in \"[[The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust]]\" (an essay in ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'') by [[Robert L. O'Connell]]. As [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], '''McCormack''' succeeded [[John F. Kennedy]] following a nuclear strike on [[Washington D.C.]] on Saturday, October 27, 1962 as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] escalated into the Two Days' War. A Russian SS-4 ([[R-12 Dvina]]) IRBM (launched from Cuba) detonated above the [[Lincoln Memorial]], leveling much of the surrounding area, including [[The White House]], taking with it Kennedy, Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and the rest of the [[National Command Authority]]. At nearly 71 upon assuming office, McCormack became the oldest serving president. Falling into ill health following his admirable handling of the crises that followed the war, he did not contest the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and was succeeded by the Republican victor [[Richard Nixon]], who became the 37th president.\n* In the alternative history novel ''Surrounded by Enemies: What if Kennedy Survived Dallas?'' by [[Bryce Zabel]], '''McCormack''' acceded to the presidency on February 24, 1966 after the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment, trial and removal from office]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]] for multiple incidents of extramarital affairs both before and during his term in office. As Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been forced to resign due to allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance, McCormack's position as Speaker of the House of Representatives meant that he was the first in the line of succession to the presidency under the provisions of the [[Presidential Succession Act|Presidential Succession Act 1947]]. For a time, it appeared that his Republican predecessor [[Gerald Ford]] would become president, but the Democrats gained a slim majority of 218-217 in the House of Representatives and McCormack once again became the Speaker. At 75 years old, he was the oldest man to take office as president. In March 1966, McCormack gave Kennedy a pardon for any crimes which he committed or may have committed while in office. He also announced that he would not run for election in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. He was succeeded by [[Richard Nixon]].\n\n===[[George McGovern]]===\n* In one of the episodes ''What If?'', program of [[Discovery Channel]], '''George McGovern''' was appointed vice president after [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] took office as the 38th president following the assassination of his predecessor [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in September 1969. After King was likewise assassinated in September 1971, McGovern became the 39th president.\n* He was also the subject of the novel ''President McGovern's First Term'' (1973) by [[Nicholas Max]].\n* In the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], two stories deal with '''McGovern''' winning the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]] and becoming the 38th president. In both stories, his vice president was [[Sargent Shriver]], the brother-in-law of [[John F. Kennedy]]. In \"Suppose They Gave a Peace...\" by [[Susan Shwartz]], McGovern wins when the youth vote turns out for him in droves, and is then blamed for the debacle that occurs when he swiftly withdraws US troops from [[South Vietnam]]. In \"Paper Trail\" by [[Brian Thomsen]], the tide turns for McGovern after reporter [[Carl Bernstein]], investigating a break-in at the [[Watergate complex]], is killed in a hit-and-run accident which is very quickly linked to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].\n* '''George McGovern''' was also elected in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] in one of the alternative timelines featured in [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s ''[[Fuzzy Dice]]''. In this case, he was narrowly elected after President [[Richard Nixon]] had undergone an assassination attempt and become completely paranoid, waging a crackdown on real and imagined domestic foes as well as a huge escalation of the [[Vietnam War]], and setting off a huge explosion of countrywide riots. Unfortunately, the riots continue and even increase after McGovern's election and a call by the new president for a return to calm proves completely ineffective. McGovern rejects a call in Congress to use the Army to quell the riots, leading to an attempted impeachment. Some military commanders try repression on their own, killing civilians and only adding to the ferocity of the riots. Eventually, the country is plunged into chaos, [[Second American Civil War|all-out civil war]], and eventually the total collapse of the Old Order. When the book's protagonist arrives some decades later, he finds a \"[[Hippie]]-style\" dictatorship presided over by the monstrous Lady Sunshine and with [[Hells Angels]] acting as the police, and the final fate of McGovern is unknown.\n* Although not actually specified, in ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' episode ''The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker'',  Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda travel back to March 15, 1972 and accidentally cause Denzel Crocker to lose his Fairy Godparents, who happen to be that time's counterparts to Cosmo and Wanda. As punishment, Jorgen Von Strangle forbids them from ever going to March 1972 again but tells them that they'll still be allowed to visit other months of that year on the proviso they won't ruin the [[1972 United States presidential election|election]] of \"'''President McGovern'''\". This suggests that Timmy was somehow responsible for McGovern's defeat or that Jorgen didn't know that George McGovern would lose the presidential election to Nixon.\n* In the short story, \"Hillary Orbits Venus\" by [[Pamela Sargent]], '''McGovern''' was elected in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] and [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]. During his term, he withdrew US troops from Vietnam and expanded funding to [[NASA]].\n\n===[[William McKinley]]===\n* In [[Ward Moore]]'s novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'', one of the time travelling characters in the alternative reality witnessed the victory of the Democratic candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]] where he had to resist the temptation of covering the confident bets made by '''McKinley's''' supporters, who were unaware that Bryan would go on to serve three terms as president. President Bryan was the candidate for both the Democratic Party and the [[Populist Party (US)|Populist Party]].\n* In the short story \"Plowshare\" by [[Martha Soukup]] in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[William Jennings Bryan]] was elected as the 25th president in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] over '''William McKinley'''. President Bryan ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] by granting full independence to [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Hawaii]]. Only 36 years old at the time of his election, he was the youngest man ever elected to the presidency. President Bryan served one term from 1897 to 1901, declining to run for re-election in [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] as he believed that presidents should only serve one term. In spite of this, in 1915, he revealed to the American public that he intended to prevent the expected Republican presidential nominee [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s plan to take the [[American entry into World War I|US into the Great War]] from coming to fruition by running against him and defeating him in the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]]. During his presidency, Bryan was a vocal supporter of [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], which was granted throughout the United States in 1913.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[1901 (novel)|1901]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''William McKinley''' died of a sudden heart attack in 1901 after being overwhelmed by the [[Imperial German plans for the invasion of the United States|invasion]] of [[Long Island]] by [[German Empire|Germany]]. He was succeeded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who became the 26th president and went on to win the war against Germany.\n* On the online timeline of the 2004 mockumentary ''[[CSA: The Confederate States of America]]'', '''William McKinley''' served as the [[President of the Confederate States of America]] from the late 1800s until 1901. According to the timeline, he was president during the alternate version of the [[Spanish-American War]], which sparked  a resurgence in the [[Manifest Destiny]] and the Confederacy's continued expansion south that would continue well into the 1920s and would include all of the [[Caribbean]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] as part of the nation's conquared territories. In 1901, McKinley was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] (as in reality). However, instead of being shot by [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], he was instead killed by an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070115204823/http://www.csathemovie.com/timeline/index.html</ref>\n\n===[[Robert McNamara]]===\n* '''Robert McNamara''' served as the president in [[Thomas M. Disch]]'s 1968 science fiction novel ''[[Camp Concentration]]''.\n\n===[[James B. McPherson]]===\n* In ''[[If the South Had Won the Civil War]]'' by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], '''James McPherson''' survived and became President of United States for two terms in the 1880s. During his Second Inaugural Speech he strongly called for reconciliation with the [[Confederate States]], arguing that the war ending in 1863 saved the lives of many who would have been killed had it dragged on. This was warmly received south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], became part of the school curriculum and helped achieve an eventual reunification (though it only came long after his death). (In actual history, '''James McPherson''' was a Union officer who was killed in 1864; this did not happen in Kantor's alternative timeline, where the war ended in 1863 with a decisive Confederate victory.)\n\n===[[Andrew Mellon]]===\n* President in 1926, in the [[Alternative History]]/[[Time Travel]] story \"A Slip in Time\" by [[S. M. Stirling]],<ref>Published in \"Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014</ref> featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived. \n* The story, taking place in [[Vienna]], makes only a passing reference to  Mellon. In general, the alternative 1926 featured in the story has a worldwide trend favoring Conservative politicians  and regimes, the Presidency of the Conservative Republican Mellon being an evident part of this.\n\n===[[H. L. Mencken]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''H. L. Mencken''' served as the 19th president of the [[North American Confederacy]] from 1928 until his death in 1933. He killed his vice president in a duel and was subsequently killed himself by his vice president's mother. After his death, the [[Continental Congress]] choose [[Frank Chodorov]] as his successor.\n\n===[[Walter Mondale]]===\n* In the short story \"Huddled Masses\" by [[Lawrence Person]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Mondale''' defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 Presidential Election]] to become the 41st president. His vice president was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], who was the first woman to hold the office. As a result, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] movement expanded, causing a civil war in [[Mexico]]. This was followed by an invasion from the United States and a massive influx of [[Latin America]]n refugees into the [[southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\n* In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode \"The Best Christmas Story Never Told\", [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] went back in time and altered history. After defeating [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], '''Walter Mondale''' surrendered the United States to the [[Soviet Union]] after his 74th day in office.\n\n===[[James Monroe]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''James Monroe''' helps [[Albert Gallatin]] arrange the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, borrowing money from private sources against the value if the land. On July 4, 1826, he would become the 5th president following the death of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and would serve until his own death five years later on July 4, 1831.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternative history series, '''James Monroe''' served as the 5th president from March 4, 1817 to March 4, 1825, as he did in real life. He was from [[Virginia]], a trait which consigned his predecessors [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) in which the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. In spite of this, Monroe was looked upon kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote American security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. This doctrine was eviscerated in 1862 when, given the victory of the Confederacy, the US was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].\n* In Edward Baxter's short story \"The Disaster of '23\", the proclamation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1823 provoked an angry reaction by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Bourbon Restoration|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], which declared war on the United States and imposed a devastating naval blockade on its shores. With the American economy in shambles, President '''James Monroe''' was eventually forced to capitulate, rescind his doctrine and officially recognize the right of European powers to intervene at their discretion in the affairs of the [[Americans|American continents]]. Monroe was subjected to impeachment proceedings for having brought this disaster upon the US. He narrowly survived the vote, but left the Presidency under a cloud, considered one of the worst Presidents in US history. In subsequent decades, the United States was increasingly weakened and reduced to a dependent status, with the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States|British]] and [[List of French ambassadors to the United States|French Ambassadors]] constantly and openly intervening in American elections and building up factions in Congress favorable to their countries' interests. The US was flooded with the products of European - particularly British - industry and never managed to build up its own industrial base. In 1917, [[Imperial Germany]] achieved a complete victory over Britain and France and became the dominant world power, the German Ambassador in Washington henceforward acting as a de facto military governor.\n\n===[[Marilyn Monroe]]===\n* In the short story \"A Dream Can Make A Difference\" by [[Beth Meacham]], contained in the anthology ''By Any Other Fame'', '''Marilyn Monroe''' survived her [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|drug overdose on August 5, 1962]] and subsequently entered politics. She was elected as the [[Governor of California]] in [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|1970]], defeating the Republican incumbent and her fellow former [[Hollywood]] star [[Ronald Reagan]]. She went on to be elected as the first female President of the United States in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] with [[Jimmy Carter]] as her [[running mate]]. After only 69 days in office, President Monroe was [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassinated in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 1981]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] as the culmination of an effort to impress [[Jodie Foster]]. She was succeeded by Carter. After [[William Henry Harrison]], who died on his 32nd day in office on April 4, 1841, she was the second shortest-serving president in US history.\n\n===[[Thomas More]]===\n* '''Thomas More''' served as President in the story \"The New Utopia\" by Bernard C. Cowper. In 2096, he was brought out of the past \u2013 taken out of the very moment of his beheading by order of [[Henry VIII of England]] and a perfect simulacrum placed in his place, the substitution being invisible to 16th Century people. Given a crash course in the history of the past five hundred years and offered the Presidency of the United States, as a desperate last measure to stop the complete demoralizing and breakdown of society \u2013 which he accepts after prolonged pondering. Voted unanimously into office by all voters who bother to show up at the polls \u2013 which is less than four percent of the American citizen body. The ambiguous ending leaves unclear whether or not he succeeded in his efforts to reverse the degeneration of American society and create the New Utopia of the title.\n\n===[[Gouverneur Morris]]===\n* President in: \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade.\n* In the story, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the Royal Navy ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being killed by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing New York City to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to [[George Washington]] as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The Constitutional Convention, held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a Senate whose members would likewise sit for life, and a House of Representatives elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. '''Gouverneur Morris''', originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale civil war. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n\n===[[Charlie Murphy]]===\n* President in: ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', episode #110\n* Vice President under [[Dave Chappelle]]; becomes president when President Chapelle goes missing during his third term.\n\n==N==\n===[[Ralph Nader]]===\n* President in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit ''A Glimpse of Our Possible Future III'' (2000), played by [[Jimmy Fallon]].\n\n===[[Richard Nixon]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[If Israel Lost the War]]'' by [[Robert Littell (author)|Robert Littell]], [[Richard Z.

As [[Sirhan Sirhan]] returned home to Jordan to celebrate the conquest of Israel, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was never [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] and went on to defeat '''Richard Nixon''' in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], becoming the 37th president.\n* In [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[The Psychotechnic League]]'', Vice President '''Richard Nixon''' succeeded as the 35th president in June 1956, following the death of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from surgical complications. Becoming president as a relatively young man of 43, only a few years removed from his active participation in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and with his anti-Communist zeal untampered by the pragmatism he might have gained in later life, Nixon embarked on a wild, provocative and confrontational policy. This resulted by 1958 in a worldwide [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], in which President Nixon himself was killed along with hundreds of millions of other people.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] known as the [[North American Confederacy]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a small-time criminal in [[California]] in 1986.\n* In ''[[Making History (novel)|Making History]]'' by [[Stephen Fry]], the protagonist Michael Young and physicist Leo Zuckerman (born Axel Bauer) accidentally created an [[hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|alternate reality wherein the Axis Powers won the Second World War]] by preventing Hitler's conception in the hope of preventing the Second World War and the [[Holocaust]]. In this reality, whereby Hitler is replaced with the more effective Rudolph Gloder, a more socially conservative United States locked in a Cold War with the Third Reich, with '''Richard Nixon''' being mentioned as having served three terms between 1960 and 1972.\n* In the [[time travel]] short story \"Hindsight\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon's presidency]] was fictionalized two decades before the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972\u20131974) in the 1953 novel ''Watergate'' by Michelle Gordian, a time traveler from the early 1980s who wrote [[science fiction]] stories under the pseudonym \"Mark Gordian.\" The novel was critically acclaimed and was compared to ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] publicly criticized ''Watergate'' which Pete Lundquist, a science fiction writer from [[California]], believed spoke well of it. As '''Nixon''' was serving as vice president under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1953, Gordian referred to him as \"'''President Cavanaugh'''\" in the novel.\n* In ''[[Watchmen]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' was on his fifth term as president after winning the [[Vietnam War]] in 1985 and making [[Vietnam]] the 51st state of the Union. He is challenged for re-election by [[Robert Redford]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n* In the alternative history ''[[Dark Future]]'' novel series by [[Kim Newman]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] after it was discovered that Kennedy was having an affair with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Under Nixon's leadership, the Solid Sixties were seen as a golden age of peace, stability and decent moral values in the United States. Legal restrictions were removed from businesses, allowing for both technological advancement and ending regulations against pollution. Racial strife was considered to be ended by the [[separate but equal]] laws. He was succeeded by [[Barry Goldwater]].\n* In the alternative history short story \"We Could Do Worse\" by [[Gregory Benford]], Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] secured the Republican presidential nomination at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]], narrowly beating General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], with the support of the [[California]] delegation which was delivered by '''Richard Nixon'''. In the [[1952 United States presidential election|election the following November]], Taft defeated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and was inaugurated as the 34th president on January 20, 1953. However, after only six months in office, President Taft died of a heart attack on July 31, 1953, as occurred in reality. He was succeeded by his vice president [[Joseph McCarthy]]. By the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 election]], when the story takes place, President McCarthy was well on his way to establishing a brutal dictatorship. The story indicates McCarthy would be re-elected with Nixon as his [[running mate]], using considerable voter intimidation provided by federal agents, and would \"diddle\" the [[United States Constitution]] to make his power permanent by [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. Two federal agents, the principal characters of the story, were grateful for Nixon's part in facilitating the late President Taft's nomination as it prevented Eisenhower, a \"pinko general\" with a \"Kraut name\", from being elected president. In reality, McCarthy died of acute [[hepatitis]] on May 2, 1957. If the same is true of the version of McCarthy depicted in the story, it is possible that Nixon will succeed him as the 36th president less than seven months after the 1956 election.\n* In the alternative timeline created by [[Biff Tannen]] in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', the May 23, 1983 edition of the ''Hill Valley Telegraph'' carries the story that '''Richard Nixon''' intends to run for a fifth term in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], having seemingly been re-elected in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] with Biff's support. He pledges to successfully conclude the [[Vietnam War]] by 1985, a reference to the events of ''Watchmen''. Once the proper timeline is restored, the story is replaced by one which states that [[Ronald Reagan]] intends to run for a second term in 1984.\n* In the short story \"The Impeachment of Adlai Stevenson\" by [[David Gerrold]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], the [[Adlai Stevenson II|title character]] defeated [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] after Eisenhower made the mistake of choosing [[Joseph McCarthy]] as his [[running mate]] instead of '''Richard Nixon'''. However, Stevenson proved to be an extremely unpopular president, leading to his impeachment and subsequent resignation in August 1958. Stevenson is succeeded by his untested 41-year-old vice-president [[John F. Kennedy]]. Although the story ends immediately after Stevenson has decided to resign, it is heavily implied that Nixon, already the front runner for the next Republican nomination, will defeat Kennedy in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and become the 36th president. This is due both to the public's antipathy towards the Democrats and the fact that Kennedy is a much derided figure due to his recent marriage to the Hollywood actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], referred to derisively as \"the new [[Monroe Doctrine]].\"\n* In the short story \"Heavy Metal\" by [[Barry N. Malzberg]], also contained in the anthology ''Alternate Presidents'' by Mike Resnick, '''Richard Nixon''' was elected as the 35th president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] following a feud between [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard J. Daley]]. He won [[1960 United States presidential election in Illinois|Illinois]] and, consequently, the election by 240,000 votes. He succeeded [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], under whom he had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961. His own vice president was [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]].\n* In the short story \"Fellow Americans\" by [[Eileen Gunn]], also contained in the anthology ''Alternate Presidents'' by Mike Resnick, [[Barry Goldwater]] defeated the early favorite and incumbent [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] and went on to be re-elected in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. During his term in office, President Goldwater ordered that [[nuclear weapon]]s be deployed against [[North Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Following his \"[[Richard Nixon's last press conference|last press conference]]\" on November 7, 1962 immediately after his defeat in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1962|1962 California gubernatorial election]] to the Democratic incumbent [[Pat Brown]], '''Richard Nixon''' retired from politics. As President Goldwater had never liked nor trusted [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s former vice president, he was pleased that Nixon had never acceded to the nation's highest office. However, Nixon re-entered the public sphere in an entirely different context eight years later. Despite an uneasy relationship with the media dating back to the [[Checkers speech]] during the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election campaign]], he parlayed his electoral defeat into television success and was given a [[late-night talk show]] entitled ''Tricky Dick'' (referring to his most famous political nickname) on [[NBC]] in 1970. Much to Goldwater's annoyance, the series garnered high ratings from its inception and, by 1990, was still as popular as ever despite being on its twentieth season. He believed that it was time for the 77-year-old Nixon to retire from television as well as politics. At the beginning of every episode, Nixon made the [[V sign]], which became his trademark. Much of Nixon's continued popularity was attributed to his use of [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]] as he frequently made jokes about his defeat by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and the perceived ineffectual nature of the office of vice president. In a 1990 edition of ''Tricky Dick'' in which he was supposedly connected to a [[lie detection|lie detector]], he admitted that he and his wife [[Pat Nixon]] had tried [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] in 1965 (before it was made illegal) which they had obtained from a [[Hollywood]] couple. After taking the LSD, Nixon imagined himself to be a [[submarine]] whereas his wife cried at the thought of all of the music trapped inside their [[piano]]. Long resident in Hollywood, the Nixon's owned a luxurious [[yacht]] and frequently entertained various actors and politicians on the boat. For instance, they maintained a friendship with Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] and his wife [[Marilyn Quayle]]. While the two couples relaxed in the yacht's [[hot tub]], Nixon learned that it was Quayle's ambition to one day send a [[manned mission to Mars]], though President [[George H. W. Bush]] was considerably more skeptical about its viability.\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Richard \"Honest Dick\" Nixon''' was a prosperous used-[[Steam car|steamer]] salesman in the [[North American Union]] city of [[Los Angeles|New Liverpool]]. He was the murdered by the [[Sons of Liberty]], a terrorist organisation, as a distraction during the theft of the [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painting ''[[The Two Georges]]'' from the [[Governor-General]]'s mansion in June 1995. Shockingly, his murder was the fifth by gunfire in New Liverpool since the beginning of the year.\n* In the alternative history novel ''Branch Point'' by [[Mona Clee]], '''Richard Nixon''' was assassinated during the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election campaign]], as were Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] and Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. Running as the [[American Independent Party]] candidate, [[George Wallace]], the former [[Governor of Alabama]], won the election that November and became the 37th president. His vice president was the retired [[United States Air Force|USAF]] General [[Curtis LeMay]].\n* In the alternative history anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'' by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]], '''Richard Nixon''' was the fourth president of the United Socialist States of America (USSA), succeeding [[Barry Goldwater]]. Nixon served as a parallel to [[Leonid Brezhnev]], as Goldwater was this world's version of [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n* In the television series ''[[Futurama]]'', '''Nixon's head''' (like the heads of other public figures from the viewers' past and present) has been preserved in a jar of H2OG fat liquid. In the episode \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\", Nixon is elected as the President of Earth in the year 3000. Nixon appears as president in several later episodes, such as \"[[Time Keeps On Slippin']]\" and \"[[A Taste of Freedom]]\". He was re-elected president in \"[[Decision 3012]]\".\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[Colonization: Down to Earth]]'' as part of the [[Worldwar series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a congressman who represented [[California]]. In 1963, Liu Han, a leading member of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], lobbied Nixon and a number of other members of Congress for military aid for his party's resistance against the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s colonization of [[China]]. Congressman Nixon was hesitant to support a [[communist party]] due to his ardent [[anti-communism]] but was convinced to acquiesce when Liu Han bluntly told him, \"You help us, you help people go free from Lizards.\"\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] but was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963]].\n* In one of the alternative timelines featured in [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s ''[[Fuzzy Dice]]'', during the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]] campaign, [[Arthur Bremer]] attempted to kill '''President Nixon''' rather than [[George Wallace]]. The assassination attempt drove Nixon into an increasingly paranoid crackdown on real and imagined domestic foes as well as a huge escalation of the [[Vietnam War]], setting off a huge explosion of countrywide riots. A few weeks before the elections, Nixon proclaimed [[martial law]] \u2013 which only escalated the riots and caused the narrow victory of [[George McGovern]]. Nixon died of a stroke at the conclusion of a hate-filled farewell speech. In later centuries, he was remembered as a satanic figure, \"The Weasel\".\n* In another timeline mentioned in Di Filippo's same book, '''Richard Nixon''' single-handedly saved the Earth from an [[alien invasion]] by letting himself be abducted and experimented upon by extraterrestrials, and was for many centuries thereafter venerated worldwide as \"The Savior\".\n* In the [[counterfactual history]] essay \"Cuban Crisis: Second Holocaust\" by [[Robert L. O'Connell]] contained in the anthology ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'', '''Richard Nixon''' was elected in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He succeeded [[John William McCormack]] as the 37th president, two years after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] escalated into [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], in which [[Washington, D.C.]] was destroyed and the US retaliated drastically by totally destroying the [[Soviet Union]] and Cuba, killing 90% of their populations. He became president at a time when the United States was being internationally accused of having perpetrated [[genocide]], the \"Second [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\" of the title. Nixon won the election after a famous \"nothing to be ashamed of\" speech, and completely refused any suggestion at nuclear disarmament of the US even though its Soviet foe no longer existed. He presided over the disintegration of [[NATO]], from which all members but the US withdrew, and expelled the [[United Nations]] from [[New York City]] after all other members of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] unanimously condemned the US. Nixon declared the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]] \"a referendum on national security\" but was defeated with a huge margin by [[Eugene McCarthy]], who promised \"global reconciliation and healing\".\n* In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the comic book ''[[newuniversal]]'' by [[Warren Ellis]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[Settling Accounts: The Grapple]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Richard Nixon''' was a soldier in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] (1941\u20131944) who was a specialist in sweeping for [[surveillance]] equipment. He was stationed in [[Philadelphia]] in 1943. His immediate superior was Sgt. [[Carl Bernstein]].\n* In the parallel universe featured in ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', '''Richard Nixon's''' portrait was used on the [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar coins]]. Furthermore, there was a Nixon Parkway in [[Manhattan|Manhatan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''The Man Who Prevented WW2'' by [[Roy Carter]], '''Richard Nixon''' was elected president in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]]. His predecessor was [[Thomas E. Dewey]].\n* In the alternative history novel ''Surrounded by Enemies: What if Kennedy Survived Dallas?'' by [[Bryce Zabel]], '''Richard Nixon''' defeated his Democratic opponent Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] of [[Maine]] in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], becoming the 37th president. His immediate predecessor was [[John William McCormack]], who acceded to the presidency on February 24, 1966 following the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment, trial and removal from office]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In November 1969, Nixon reluctantly invited Kennedy to meet the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]. Nixon was re-elected in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] but was impeached himself during his second term. He was succeeded by [[Ronald Reagan]].\n* In Caroline Weinbaum's short story \"Mired up in the Cuban War\", '''Richard Nixon''' defeated Kennedy in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] and was elected President. Nixon was infuriated by the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961 and decided to send the US Army on a full-scale direct invasion of Cuba. American troops met stiff resistance but after half a year managed to occupy [[Havana]] and the other main Cuban cities. [[Fidel Castro]] was killed in battle with the invaders, with a heroic myth growing around what many Cubans considered as his martyrdom. A government composed of anti-Communist Cuban exiles was installed, but enjoyed little credibility or popular support. [[Che Guevara]] escaped and launched a highly effective guerrilla campaign, inflicting heavy losses on the American forces. Guevara then managed to extend the war, secretly travelling to [[Puerto Rico]] and touching off a rebellion there, too. The Puerto Rican revolt first involved only radical groups, but brutal moves made in an effort to stamp it out aroused the sympathy of more and more Puerto Ricans. Soon, the Cuban War became extremely unpopular in the US, students and members of Hispanic communities engaging in increasingly massive demonstrations and protests. The tensions were increased by President Nixon's hostility to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and his almost open backing for Southern racists. In April 1963, [[Martin Luther King]] held a dramatic meeting with Che Guevara at [[Geneva]], declaring his support for the Cuban liberation struggle and calling for immediate withdrawal of American troops. On his return, King was arrested and the furious Nixon declared that \"He will be charged with High Treason, and the prosecution will seek the death penalty!\". There followed a nationwide wave of demonstrations and protests - answered by the FBI arresting overnight more than a thousand student activists and black and Hispanic leaders, many of them being beaten up and three killed \"while resisting arrest\". In the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]], held under conditions near to [[Second American Civil War|civil war]], Nixon was decisively defeated and [[John Kennedy]] swept to power by a landslide. Nixon, bitter and angry, refused to hold a formal handover, leaving the White House in total chaos a few days ahead of Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy announced an immediate ceasefire and called for negotiations with the Cuban and Puerto Rican rebels, as well as pardoning King and other detainees. With the American public hopeful of an end to the Cuban nightmare, hardly any attention was given to the fall of [[South Vietnam]] in April 1965 and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s triumphal entry into [[Saigon]]; most Americans did not know or care where or what [[Vietnam]] was.     \n* In one of the alternative history timelines featured in Claire North's \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\", in which technological development was much accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s due to the intervention of a fanatic time-traveler, President '''Richard Nixon''' announced that a pill turning the skin of black people inro white would be the ultimate solution to the race problem. This being a minor point in the book's overall plot, there is no detailed description of how Nixon's idea worked out in practice.\n* In the film ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', a 2004 [[mockumentary]] directed by [[Kevin Willmott]] which depicts a timeline in which the Confederacy won the [[American Civil War]], completely annexed and absorbed the United States, and perpetuated [[slavery]]. By [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], when only 29 percent of voters approve of slavery, Democratic candidate '''Richard Nixon''' was defeated by [[Roman Catholic]] Republican candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]. On the online timeline of the film, it is reveled that Nixon is elected Confederate President in his own right. During his presidency, Nixon [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|travels to China in 1972]] (the first time a Confederate President would do so). His talks with the [[China|Chinese]] government would open the way for Confederate-run labor camps to be run in China, which results in cheaper goods being made and imported from China. However, that year on June 17, five men were caught placing wire taps at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate Hotel]] in order to spy on the Confederate National Committee. As the investigation wore on, it became clear that the orders came from high-up. How high up was unclear until a mysterious anonymous source, using the code name \u201cDark Throat\u201d, tipped off the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] that Nixon gave the orders to place the taps. Under pressure from the press and the CBI investigation of the [[Watergate scandal]] Nixon was forced to resign from the presidency on August 8, 1974 (as in real life). During his [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|resignation speech]] he reminded the public, \u201cI am not a Negro!\u201d. Still, years from the event, the mystery surrounding the informant \u201cDark Throat\u201d is still speculated about. The most popular theory is that one of the White House slaves had overheard the President, and turn against Nixon by turning him in to the CBI. With the penalty of slaves turning against their masters in the Confederacy being death, it is unlikely the informant would ever even be known.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070305183703/http://www.csathemovie.com/timeline/moreinfo/nixon.html </ref>\n\n===[[Albert Jay Nock]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''Albert Jay Nock''' served as the 18th president of the [[North American Confederacy]] from 1912 to 1928.\n\n===[[Chuck Norris]]===\n* '''Chuck Norris''' serves as president in [[Andrew Cartmel]] novel: \"''[[Doctor Who]]: [[Virgin New Adventures|The New Adventures]]: Warhead''\". He ended immigration to the United States, and presided over the establishment of Local Development laws which prevented the unemployed from leaving their local area to find work.\n\n===[[George W. Norris]]===\n* In [[Ward Moore]]'s 1953 novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'', '''George Norris''' is mentioned as the sitting president in 1940. A member of the Populist Party, he was elected in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] but declined to run for a second term in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]].\n\n===[[Oliver North]]===\n* In the alternative history ''[[Dark Future]]'' novel series by [[Kim Newman]], '''North''' is president in 1995. His predecessor was [[Charlton Heston|Charlton \"Big Chuck\" Heston]].\n* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the ''[[Sliders]]'' Season One episode \"Summer of Love\", the United States lost the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] on May 10, 1942. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] proceeded to invade [[Australia]]. After the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]] liberated North Australia whereas the United States liberated South Australia. While the United States rebuilt their portion of Australia, the Soviets continued their occupation of North Australia and created a [[communist state]]. In the early 1990s, the Australian War broke out when North Australia attacked South Australia. '''President North''' unofficially joined the war to prevent the fall of South Australia to North Australia, which was backed militarily by the Soviet Union. As the war dragged on with no sign of either victory or peaceful resolution, it became increasingly unpopular in the United States and, by 1995, the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]], centered in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of [[San Francisco]], had spread throughout the US and beyond.\n* In a parallel universe featured in the ''Sliders'' Season Three episodes \"The Exodus, Part I\" and \"The Exodus, Part II\", '''North''' was the president in 1997. In this universe, the [[Soviet Union]] had never collapsed and the [[Cold War]] lasted until 1997, at which time all life on Earth (with the exception of 150 people who escaped to another universe) was wiped out by the radiation from a [[pulsar]].\n* '''North''' won a landslide victory over an unnamed president ([[Alan Alda]]) in ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]''.\n* '''North''' succeeded [[George H. W. Bush]] as the 42nd president after the latter died of pneumonia in an alternative timeline during [[Walt Simonson]]'s run on ''[[Fantastic Four]]''.\n\n==O==\n===[[Barack Obama]]===\n* According to the ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' [[Fringe (season 1)|Season One]] finale \"[[There's More Than One of Everything]]\", '''Obama''' was elected as president in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] in the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured on the series. In May 2009, Obama, his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] and their daughters [[Family of Barack Obama#Immediate family|Malia and Sasha]] were preparing to move into the recently rebuilt [[White House]]. The original version of the traditional presidential residence had been destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] perpetrated by [[al-Qaeda]] whereas [[the Pentagon]] had been severely damaged. In contrast, the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] remained standing.\n* In ''Franz Ferdinand Lives! A World Without World War I'' (2014) by [[Richard Ned Lebow]] in which neither [[World War I]] nor [[World War II]] took place, '''Obama''' was elected [[Governor of Hawaii]] in 2008 and served two highly successful terms. In the 1990s, because of the US-Japanese Cold War, many demanded that [[Japanese people|Japanese]] residents and [[Japanese American]]s be either detained or deported. Following a riot in [[Los Angeles]], the Republican president announced that everyone of Japanese descent had 30 days to leave the country. Those with [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] were allowed to remain but were ordered to report to transport to detention camps until tensions subsided. Governor Obama considered these measures to be gross overreactions and called upon the government to make public any evidence that it had of a security threat posed by people of Japanese descent. The [[United States Attorney General]] refused to do so on the grounds of national security and did not respond to Obama's request to be briefed on camera. In response, Obama set his plan in motion: Japanese Americans were invited to turn themselves in, take up residence in resort hotels along [[Oahu]]'s [[Waikiki|Waikiki Beach]] and limit their movement to Waikiki and [[Honolulu]]'s immediate downtown. Other civic groups organised a \"Parade of Freedom\" in which citizens of diverse ancestry peacefully demonstrated their support for the [[United States Constitution]] and its guarantees against detention without charge. A small counter-demonstration ensued but public opinion overwhelmingly supported Governor Obama. The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] threatened to expel all Americans from [[Japan]] and arrest a prominent businessman and his wife on charges of spying. Evidence of the couple's activities is given to the press and the American media became divided over whether the couple were truly spies or were being set up. Obama insisted that the federal government foot the bill for room and board at resort hotels for Japanese Americans. The president considered sending the [[Hawaii National Guard]] to clear the hotels and move the Japanese Americans to a detention camp. Students, religious leaders and other citizens held round-the-clock visits at the hotels, meaning that any military action would have involved arresting them and further alienating the state's population. Consequently, the president backed down and negotiated a compromise agreement whereby Japanese tourists and expatriates would be quietly repatriated and Japanese residents would be allowed to return to their homes in Hawaii. However, militarily sensitive areas in the state were declared off-limits. Relations with Japan gradually improved and, in the interim, none of its citizens were arrested or charged with a crime.\n* In the first episode of [[The Last Ship (TV series)|The Last Ship]], '''Barack Obama''' succumbed to the Red Flu shortly after the breakout of the disease. Following his death, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] succeeded him before he too succumbed to the disease a week later. After Biden's death, he was replaced by President August, the former fictitious [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], who delivers the news via teleconference to the ''[[USS Nathan James]]''. Although neither he nor Obama are mentioned by name in the series, a printed news article in the Season 2 episode \"Safe Zone\" shows Obama as the incumbent President before the outbreak, meeting with the newly appointed [[Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] Jeffery Michener (who also goes on to serve as president later in the series).\n\n===[[Family of Barack Obama#Immediate family|Malia Obama]]===\n* '''Malia Obama''' is President in 2035 in the series finale of ''[[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|Life On Mars]]''. Frank Morgan at [[Mission Control]] stated that she had gone with her sister to [[Chicago]] to be with their ailing father [[Barack Obama]] rather than witness humans landing on [[Mars]] at Mission Control. Although not specifically identified, Malia would meet the minimum age requirement of 35 by 2033, assuming no changes to the [[Constitution of the United States]] or the [[United States presidential line of succession]] before July 4, 2033 by being at most [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].\n\n===[[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen|Twin Presidents Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]]===\n* '''The Olsen Twins''' are mentioned as both being President, though not seen by the Ghost of Christmas Future in ''[[A Dennis the Menace Christmas]]''.\n* Never seen, but mentioned by the Ghost of Christmas Future.\n\n===[[Osceola]]===\n* In the alternative history novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] by [[L. Neil Smith]] in which the United States became a [[libertarianism|libertarian state]] after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, '''Osceola''' served as the 9th President of the [[North American Confederacy]] from 1842 to 1848. After [[Sequoyah|Sequoyah Guess]], he was the second [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to hold the office of the presidency.\n\n===[[Lee Harvey Oswald]]===\nIn Lilian W. Berger's novelette ''The Great Chaos'', '''Lee Harvey Oswald''' was only lightly wounded by [[Jack Ruby]]'s bullet, and was duly prosecuted and sentenced to death for murdering President Kennedy. However, the execution was delayed by repeated appeals, and meanwhile the United States fell apart. The assassination of President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1965 was followed by mass rioting, armed incidents and attempted military coups, by 1966 degenerating into a full-fledged, multilateral [[Second Civil War]]. In July 1966 a radical militia stormed the prison and set Oswald free, declaring his killing Kennedy to have been \"a most praiseworthy act, ridding the country of a despicable \u00a0tyrant\". A coalition of Black Nationalists and radical whites which took over [[Memphis, Tennessee]] proclaimed \u00a0[[Malcolm X]] as President of the United States and Oswald as his Vice President. When Malcolm X was killed during a skirmish with a unit of US Marines trying to take over Memphis, Oswald was declared President - one of six rival Presidents at different locations in US\u00a0territory and two others among the army in South\u00a0Vietnam.\u00a0 During seven months as an Acting President, his authority recognized mainly in Memphis and to a lesser degree in the rest of Tennessee and Kentucky, Oswald strove to widen his base of support, restrain the more wild and unruly pf followers, and prevent ugly incidents breaking out between Black and White militias, despite both being outspokenly opposed to racism. Concerned at news of [[Richard Nixon]] consolidating a harsh dictatorial regime in [[California]], gaining possession of tanks and fighter planes and extending his power eastwards, Osward renounced his claim to the Presidency and threw his support behind [[Eugene McCarthy]], who was\u00a0proclaimed President in New York City and gained support along much of the East Coast. However, before he could depart for a summit with McCarthy, Oswald was assassinated by the most radical faction of the Memphis Liberation Front, which accused him of \"Selling out\". After the Reunification of 1979, President [[Jane Fonda]] and Vice President [[Alan Ginsberg]] inaugurated a memorial plaque to Oswald: \"It was a time of terrible national madness and Oswald was one of those who launched the madness - but when he had the chance, he tried to act sanely and sensibly, which cannot be said of many others\" said President\u00a0Fonda.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Lists of US Presidents and Vice Presidents}}\n{{Fictional government navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States Fictional Presidencies Of Historical Figures (M-O), List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional Presidents of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Mandarax", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_United_States_presidencies_of_historical_figures_(M%E2%80%93O)"}
