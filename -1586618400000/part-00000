While the [[Scottish Cup]] includes all the teams within the SPFL, the competition is run and organised by the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\n==Background==\nA [[Scottish football league system]] was first created in 1890, when the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) was formed. Traditionally the league had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. By the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]] season. This setup continued until the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395]] season, when a four divisional structure was introduced, along with a new [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, the Premier Division clubs decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL), following the example of the [[English Premier League]].<ref name=\"121218 plan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22132504 |title=Scottish clubs set for vote on league reconstruction proposals |publisher=BBC |first=Chris |last=McLaughlin |date=14 April 2013 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to control more of the revenue generated by the game and to negotiate its contracts with sponsors and broadcasters.<ref name=\"121218 plan\"/> SFL revenues had been divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt its demise. Young people were leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe final resident, James Gillies Jr., the son of a [[stonemason]], left his home there for final time on 4 January, 1938.<ref name=courier/><ref name=psns/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pitmiddle}}\n[[Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross]]\n[[Category:Former villages in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Seasider53", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitmiddle"}

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0049530058|location=London|pages=204|oclc=152680}}</ref>\n\n===Oil era===\n[[File:Dubai Water Canal Business Bay.jpg|thumb|View of [[Business Bay]]]]\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring [[Abu Dhabi]], oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners.

Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nCritically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep water free port constructed by British company [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]]. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nPort Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===\n[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]\nDubai and the other '[[Trucial States]]' had long been a British [[protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'.

There are also 18 cases of homicide-suicide involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).<ref name=kenedi>{{cite journal |last1=Kenedi |first1=Christopher |last2=Friedman |first2=Susan Hatters |last3=Watson |first3=Dougal |last4=Preitner |first4=Claude |title=Suicide and Murder-Suicide Involving Aircraft |journal=Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance |volume=87 |number=4 |date=April 2016 |pages= 388\u2013396 |publisher=Aerospace Medical Association |doi=10.3357/AMHP.4474.2016}}</ref>\n\nKenedi et al. note that homicide-suicide events occur only extremely rarely, but that their impact, in terms of the proportion of deaths, is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. They state: \"There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.\"<ref name=kenedi/>\n\n==Prevention==\nU.S. regulations require at least two flight crew members to be in

They note that \"In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors.\" The study (1999\u20132015) reviews medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases and includes 65 cases of pilot suicide (compared to 195 pilot-errors in those years) and six cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft. There are also 18 cases of homicide-suicide involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).<ref name=kenedi>{{cite journal |last1=Kenedi |first1=Christopher |last2=Friedman |first2=Susan Hatters |last3=Watson |first3=Dougal |last4=Preitner |first4=Claude |title=Suicide and Murder-Suicide Involving Aircraft |journal=Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance |volume=87 |number=4 |date=April 2016 |pages= 388\u2013396 |publisher=Aerospace Medical Association |doi=10.3357/AMHP.4474.2016}}</ref>\n\nKenedi et al. note that homicide-suicide events occur only extremely rarely, but that their impact, in terms of the proportion of deaths, is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. They state: \"There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.\"<ref name=kenedi/>\n\n==Prevention==\nU.S. regulations require at least two flight crew members to be in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons, to be able to help in any  medical or other emergency, including intervening if a crew member would try to crash the plane.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/reducing-risks-after-the-germanwings-crash.html Reducing Risks After the Germanwings Crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821050520/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/opinion/reducing-risks-after-the-germanwings-crash.html |date=August 21, 2017 }} (''New York Times'', March 26, 2015)</ref><ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/germanwings-crash-murder-suicide-pilot/388778/ Could the Germanwings Crash Have Been Avoided?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203233212/http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/germanwings-crash-murder-suicide-pilot/388778/ |date=December 3, 2016 }} (''The Atlantic'', March 26, 2015)</ref> Following the deliberate crash of [[Germanwings Flight 9525]] on March 24, 2015, some European and Canadian airlines adopted a two-in-cockpit policy<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/germanwings-crash-prompts-airlines-to-introduce-cockpit-rule-of-two Germanwings crash prompts airlines to introduce cockpit \u2018rule of two\u2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094636/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/germanwings-crash-prompts-airlines-to-introduce-cockpit-rule-of-two |date=February 20, 2017 }} (''The Guardian'', March 26, 2015)</ref><ref>[https://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8294971/pilot-suicide-crash The disturbing history of pilots who deliberately crash their own planes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821045533/https://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8294971/pilot-suicide-crash |date=August 21, 2017 }} (''Vox'', March 26, 2015)</ref> as did all Australian airlines for aircraft with fifty or more passenger seats.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-30/federal-government-announces-new-cockpit-safety-standards/6358474 Germanwings: Australia tightens cockpit safety laws in wake of French Alps plane crash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330233012/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-30/federal-government-announces-new-cockpit-safety-standards/6358474 |date=March 30, 2015 }} (''Australian Broadcasting Corporation News'', March 30, 2015)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aviation accidents and incidents]]\n*[[Aviation safety]]\n*[[List of aircraft hijackings]], for instances where a hijacker crashed the aircraft\n*[[Kamikaze]]\n*[[Vehicle ramming attack]]\n*[[Mental health in aviation]]\n*[[Suicide by cop]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/26/travel/germanwings-crash-death-by-pilot-cases/ Deliberate acts: 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing] at cnn.com\n* [http://news.aviation-safety.net/2015/03/26/list-of-aircraft-accidents-and-incidents-deliberately-caused-by-pilots/ List of aircraft accidents and incidents intentionally caused by pilots] at aviation-safety.net\n* [http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/pilot-suicide-cases-few-and-far-between-20140408-zqs8w.html Pilot suicide cases few and far between] at canberratimes.com\n{{Lists of aviation accidents and incidents}}\n{{Suicide navbox|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Suicide by pilot}}\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving deliberate crashes| ]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by hijacking| ]]\n[[Category:Suicide methods|Aircraft pilot]]\n[[Category:Murder\u2013suicides|Aircraft pilot]]\n[[Category:Lists of aviation accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:Aviators who committed suicide|Pilot]]\n[[Category:Aviation and health]]\n[[Category:Kamikaze| ]]\n[[Category:Aviation risks]]\n", "name_user": "K Magz", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_by_pilot"}

A replica at Khanh Hoa Museum.]]{{Short description|Spread of Indian culture}}\nDating back to the first century, [[India]]n culture started making its way into the region of [[Southeast Asia]]. The expansion of Indian culture into these areas was given the term ''Indianization''.<ref name=\"acharya\">{{cite web|last1=Acharya|first1=Amitav|title=The \"Indianization of Southeast Asia\" Revisited: Initiative, Adaptation and Transformation in Classical Civilizations|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Indianisation%20of%20Southeast%20Asia%20Revisited.pdf|website=amitavacharya.com}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}} The term was coined by French archaeologist, [[George Coedes]] in his work ''Histoire ancienne des \u00e9tats hindouis\u00e9s d'Extr\u00eame-Orient'' (The Indianized States of Southeast Asia). He defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhist|Buddhism]] and the [[sanskritization|Sanskrit dialect]]. A large number of nations came under the influence of the [[Indosphere]] becoming a part of [[Greater India]], the cultural expansion caused the [[Sanskritization]] of [[South East Asia]], the rise of [[Indianized kingdoms]], spread of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]] and the [[Silk road transmission of Buddhism]]. [[Indian honorifics]] were adopted into the [[Malay styles and titles|Malay]], [[Thai royal and noble titles|Thai]], [[Filipino styles and honorifics|Filipino]] and [[Indonesian names#Honorifics|Indonesian]] languages. The [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], both historical (PIO or Person of Indian-Origin) and current (NRI or Non-Resident Indian), play an ongoing key role in the region in terms of geopolitical, strategic, trade, cultural traditions, and economic aspects, with most Southeast Asian countries having sizable Indian communities alongside often much larger [[Chinese in Southeast Asia|ethnic Chinese minorities]].\n\n==The spread of Indianisation==\n{{See also|Austronesian maritime trade network|Spice trade|Maritime Silk Road}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThere are many different theories for how Indianization spread throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These differing theories each argue for a different caste of Indians as being the main propagator of Indian language and culture into Southeast Asia.\n\n===Theory of the Vaishya traders===\nThe first of these theories focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] traders, and their role for bringing Indian traditions into Southeast Asia through trade. Southeast Asia was rich in resources that were desired in the Indian sub-continent, the most important of which being gold.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=May 21\u201323, 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\nDuring the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]], and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krom|first1=N.J.|title=Barabudur, Archeological Description|date=1927|publisher=The Hague}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Theory of the Kshatriya warriors===\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the [[Kshatriya]] class of warriors. This hypothesis does a good job at explaining state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory has not attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=\"lukas\" />\n\n===Theory of the Brahmins===\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahmin]] scholars. These Brahmins used the maritime routes established by the Vaishya traders, and brought with them many of the [[Hindu]] religious and philosophical traditions to spread to the elite classes of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"lukas\" /> Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmins had influence beyond just the fields of religion and philosophy however, and soon Southeast Asia had adopted many Indian influenced codes of law and architecture.\n\nA combination of all three theories can explain the Indianization of Southeast Asia, rather than just choosing one. There was an extensive maritime trade network, which allowed for traders to extract gold and spices from Southeast Asia.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L. Smith|title=\"INDIANIZATION\" FROM THE INDIAN POINT OF VIEW: TRADE AND CULTURAL CONTACTS WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA IN THE EARLY FIRST MILLENNIUM C.E.')|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|date=1999|volume=42.|issue=11\u201317|pages=1\u201326|jstor=3632296|doi=10.1163/1568520991445588}}</ref> Once these trade networks had been established, it paved the way for new classes of warriors to exert military prowess over select Southeast Asian areas. Finally, these extensive trade networks also allowed for the influx of Brahmin scholars, who impressed many Southeast Asian elites with their knowledge of law, arts, philosophy.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Thus through the Brahmin scholars many of these Indian and Hindu practices were propagated throughout all social classes Southeast Asia.\n\n==Literature==\n\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes.  Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws.<ref name=\"smith\"/> The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\"/> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \u201creincarnations or descendants\u201d of the Hindu gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.<ref name=\"coedes\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n\nThe effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kleinmeyer|first1=Cindy|title=Religions of Southeast Asia|url=https://www.niu.edu/cseas/_pdf/lesson-plans/k-12/origins-religion.pdf|website=niu.edu|publisher=Northern Illinois University|accessdate=June 2004}}</ref> The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals.\n\n===The Mandala===\nThe [[Mandala]] is a religious symbol representing the universe and is also involved in the political system of Southeast Asia. The center of the Mandala is considered to contain the power while the power then spreads outwards. This replicates the how the political system within Southeast Asia has a powerful center of administration. The Mandala, just like a political system changes from empire to empire with its relation to the King and the empire.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Caste System==\nThe caste system divides Hindus into a hierarchical groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma).The caste system, defined by authoritative book on Hindu law wrote that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. Once born into a group, one can not move into different levels. Lower castes are never able to climb higher within the caste system, limiting the economies progress from growing. The system divides Hindus into four categories - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras. Brahmins consist of those who teach and educate such as priest and teachers. Kshatriyas include those who maintain law and order. Vaishyas consist of businessmen, craftsmen  and merchants. Shudras consist of skilled and unskilled labourers and farmers.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Is India's Caste System?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 2017}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to southeast Asia. By traveling to these countries they were able to inform others on their beliefs and spark the beginning of the Hindu and Buddhist cultures in Southeast Asia. These Brahmins introduced the caste system to all the countries; however, more so in Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. Unlike India the caste system was not as strict.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> As a result of all these different writings, there are big speculations that the Brahmins has a big role on their religion. There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. Although they have some similarities, Southeast Asians did not use the Hindu system enitirely and adjusted what they did use to their local context. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Historiography of South East Asia==\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from  the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region.The prevalent interpretation caused mainly because of the ontological differences, fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre colonial Asia, was apparently that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies along with innovation becoming prey to tyranny had rendered history cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n \nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction  gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false |title = Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830|isbn = 9781139437622|last1 = Lieberman|first1 = Victor|date = 2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Development of caste system===\nAnother main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>{{page}}\n\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Decline of Indianization==\n===Rise of Islam===\nIslamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islamism coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Distinction from colonialism==\nAmitav Acharya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com|title=Amitav Acharya|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}} argues that \"Indianization is different from traditional [[colonialism]]\" due to the fact that \"it doesn\u2019t involve strangers coming in and taking over an unknown land.\"\n\nInstead, Indian influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through [[Southeast Asia]], making the traditions a part of the region.The interactions between India and Southeast Asia were marked by waves of influence and dominance.

The expansion of Indian culture into these areas was given the term ''Indianization''.<ref name=\"acharya\">{{cite web|last1=Acharya|first1=Amitav|title=The \"Indianization of Southeast Asia\" Revisited: Initiative, Adaptation and Transformation in Classical Civilizations|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Indianisation%20of%20Southeast%20Asia%20Revisited.pdf|website=amitavacharya.com}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}} The term was coined by French archaeologist, [[George Coedes]] in his work ''Histoire ancienne des \u00e9tats hindouis\u00e9s d'Extr\u00eame-Orient'' (The Indianized States of Southeast Asia). He defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhist|Buddhism]] and the [[sanskritization|Sanskrit dialect]].<ref name=\"coedes\">{{cite book|last1=Coedes|first1=George|title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date=1967|publisher=Australian National University Press}}</ref>{{page}} A large number of nations came under the influence of the [[Indosphere]] becoming a part of [[Greater India]], the cultural expansion caused the [[Sanskritization]] of [[South East Asia]], the rise of [[Indianized kingdoms]], spread of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]] and the [[Silk road transmission of Buddhism]]. [[Indian honorifics]] were adopted into the [[Malay styles and titles|Malay]], [[Thai royal and noble titles|Thai]], [[Filipino styles and honorifics|Filipino]] and [[Indonesian names#Honorifics|Indonesian]] languages. The [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], both historical (PIO or Person of Indian-Origin) and current (NRI or Non-Resident Indian), play an ongoing key role in the region in terms of geopolitical, strategic, trade, cultural traditions, and economic aspects, with most Southeast Asian countries having sizable Indian communities alongside often much larger [[Chinese in Southeast Asia|ethnic Chinese minorities]].\n\n==The spread of Indianisation==\n{{See also|Austronesian maritime trade network|Spice trade|Maritime Silk Road}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\nThere are many different theories for how Indianization spread throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These differing theories each argue for a different caste of Indians as being the main propagator of Indian language and culture into Southeast Asia.\n\n===Theory of the Vaishya traders===\nThe first of these theories focuses on the caste of [[Vaishya]] traders, and their role for bringing Indian traditions into Southeast Asia through trade. Southeast Asia was rich in resources that were desired in the Indian sub-continent, the most important of which being gold.<ref name=lukas>{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Helmut|title=1 THEORIES OF INDIANIZATIONExemplified by Selected Case Studies from Indonesia (Insular Southeast Asia)|journal=International SanskritConference|date=May 21\u201323, 2001|url=https://www.academia.edu/4803585}}</ref>\nDuring the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the [[Roman Empire]], and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krom|first1=N.J.|title=Barabudur, Archeological Description|date=1927|publisher=The Hague}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Theory of the Kshatriya warriors===\nAnother theory states that Indianization spread through the [[Kshatriya]] class of warriors. This hypothesis does a good job at explaining state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory has not attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.<ref name=\"lukas\" />\n\n===Theory of the Brahmins===\nThe most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of [[Brahmin]] scholars. These Brahmins used the maritime routes established by the Vaishya traders, and brought with them many of the [[Hindu]] religious and philosophical traditions to spread to the elite classes of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"lukas\" /> Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmins had influence beyond just the fields of religion and philosophy however, and soon Southeast Asia had adopted many Indian influenced codes of law and architecture.\n\nA combination of all three theories can explain the Indianization of Southeast Asia, rather than just choosing one. There was an extensive maritime trade network, which allowed for traders to extract gold and spices from Southeast Asia.<ref name=smith>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L. Smith|title=\"INDIANIZATION\" FROM THE INDIAN POINT OF VIEW: TRADE AND CULTURAL CONTACTS WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA IN THE EARLY FIRST MILLENNIUM C.E.')|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|date=1999|volume=42.|issue=11\u201317|pages=1\u201326|jstor=3632296|doi=10.1163/1568520991445588}}</ref> Once these trade networks had been established, it paved the way for new classes of warriors to exert military prowess over select Southeast Asian areas. Finally, these extensive trade networks also allowed for the influx of Brahmin scholars, who impressed many Southeast Asian elites with their knowledge of law, arts, philosophy.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Thus through the Brahmin scholars many of these Indian and Hindu practices were propagated throughout all social classes Southeast Asia.\n\n==Literature==\n\nScripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes.  Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws.<ref name=\"smith\"/> The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of \"God King\" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\"/> The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as \u201creincarnations or descendants\u201d of the Hindu gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.<ref name=\"coedes\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n\nThe effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kleinmeyer|first1=Cindy|title=Religions of Southeast Asia|url=https://www.niu.edu/cseas/_pdf/lesson-plans/k-12/origins-religion.pdf|website=niu.edu|publisher=Northern Illinois University|accessdate=June 2004}}</ref> The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals.\n\n===The Mandala===\nThe [[Mandala]] is a religious symbol representing the universe and is also involved in the political system of Southeast Asia. The center of the Mandala is considered to contain the power while the power then spreads outwards. This replicates the how the political system within Southeast Asia has a powerful center of administration. The Mandala, just like a political system changes from empire to empire with its relation to the King and the empire.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Caste System==\nThe caste system divides Hindus into a hierarchical groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma).The caste system, defined by authoritative book on Hindu law wrote that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. Once born into a group, one can not move into different levels. Lower castes are never able to climb higher within the caste system, limiting the economies progress from growing. The system divides Hindus into four categories - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras. Brahmins consist of those who teach and educate such as priest and teachers. Kshatriyas include those who maintain law and order. Vaishyas consist of businessmen, craftsmen  and merchants. Shudras consist of skilled and unskilled labourers and farmers.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Is India's Caste System?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35650616|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 2017}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to southeast Asia. By traveling to these countries they were able to inform others on their beliefs and spark the beginning of the Hindu and Buddhist cultures in Southeast Asia. These Brahmins introduced the caste system to all the countries; however, more so in Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. Unlike India the caste system was not as strict.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> As a result of all these different writings, there are big speculations that the Brahmins has a big role on their religion. There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. Although they have some similarities, Southeast Asians did not use the Hindu system enitirely and adjusted what they did use to their local context. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Historiography of South East Asia==\nThe history of [[South East Asia]] was mostly always written from  the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region.The prevalent interpretation caused mainly because of the ontological differences, fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre colonial Asia, was apparently that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies along with innovation becoming prey to tyranny had rendered history cyclical, immobile and non-linear.\n \nThe belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction  gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus [[Indosphere|Indianization]] was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-01JisWpJbEC&q=Indian#v=snippet&q=Indian&f=false |title = Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800\u20131830|isbn = 9781139437622|last1 = Lieberman|first1 = Victor|date = 2003-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Development of caste system===\nAnother main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Dougald J. W|title=Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia|journal=AltaMira Press|date=2007}}</ref>{{page}}\n\nSimilar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Decline of Indianization==\n===Rise of Islam===\nIslamic control took over as well in the midst of the thirteenth century to trump the Hinduist kingdoms. In the process of Islamism coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms, trade was heavily practiced and the now Islamic Indians started becoming merchants all over Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"coedes\" /> Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamic control has spanned to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca, and has therefore stressed a widespread rise of Islamization.<ref name=\"coedes\" />\n\n==Distinction from colonialism==\nAmitav Acharya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amitavacharya.com|title=Amitav Acharya|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{reliable|date=November 2019}} argues that \"Indianization is different from traditional [[colonialism]]\" due to the fact that \"it doesn\u2019t involve strangers coming in and taking over an unknown land.\"\n\nInstead, Indian influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through [[Southeast Asia]], making the traditions a part of the region.The interactions between India and Southeast Asia were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points the influence was used to take over. Indianization and its influence was seen in nearly all aspects of Southeast Asian society and history. Before the rise of Indianisation, influence of Indian culture, and the introduction of Islam the history of Southeast Asia and its people was unrecorded.

The High Court\u2019s decision reveals that, from the start, there were two sides to this story \u2014 a flawed church that Pell represented and a flawed Victorian legal system prejudiced against him.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

The High Court\u2019s decision reveals that, from the start, there were two sides to this story \u2014 a flawed church that Pell represented and a flawed Victorian legal system prejudiced against him.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?
