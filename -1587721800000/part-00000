former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. Throughout his career, Diouf played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].\n\nHaving started his professional football career in France with [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]], [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]], Diouf finalised a move to [[Premier League]] side [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] prior<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=25235.html| title=Liverpool confirm Diouf signing| date=1 June 2002| publisher=UEFA| accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] for [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] and went on to have a memorable tournament. He has also played in England's top flight for [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] before a stint in the [[Scottish Premier League]] with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In 2011, he joined [[Football League Championship]] side [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] but was released at the end of the 2011\u201312 season following the club's relegation. He then moved to [[Leeds United]] where he spent two seasons, making 40 appearances.<ref>{{cite news|title=Warnock signs bad boy Diouf... a year after comparing him to a sewer rat!|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2186959/Leeds-sign-El-Hadji-Diouf.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> During his nine-year international career, he scored 21 goals in 69 caps; he has also garnered a large amount of notoriety for a series of controversial incidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/6221942/El-Hadji-Diouf-wall-of-shame.html|title=El-Hadji Diouf: wall of shame|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London|date=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Dakar]], Senegal, Diouf came from a [[Serer people|Serer]] background of the noble [[Joof family|Diouf family]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nDiouf started his career in France with [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard]]. He made his debut appearance in a 2\u20131 win against [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] on 12 November 1998, before moving to [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] for the 1999\u20132000 season. He moved to [[RC Lens|Lens]] the following season, spending two years at the [[Pas-de-Calais]].\n\n===Liverpool===\nIn early June 2002 he was reportedly linked with the English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] who had also just signed his club and international compatriot [[Salif Diao]]. The news initially broke following his Man of The Match performance in the opening [[FIFA World Cup 2002]] [[2002_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_A#France_vs_Senegal|1-0 group game vs France]], who were the defending World and European Champions and one of the favourites for the 2002 tournament. Lens initially denied that the signing had been made, but it was finally confirmed on the 2nd of June with an estimated price tag of \u00a310m. His continued impressive performances in the World Cup for Senegal, where they reached the quarter finals, led to much excitement prior to his arrival in England.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/senegal/newsid_2020000/2020547.stm| title=Diouf signs for Liverpool| date=1 June 2002| publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=carra>{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Terry|title=Jamie Carragher blasted by former Liverpool FC team mate El-Hadji Diouf|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2010/12/23/jamie-carragher-blasted-by-former-liverpool-fc-team-mate-el-hadji-diouf-100252-27875364/|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=23 December 2010}}</ref> Diouf was the striker that manager [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]] hoped would take the Premier League title from Arsenal, after Liverpool had finished in second place the previous season.<ref name=lfchistory/> \n\nDiouf won praises for his early games for Liverpool including his first game at [[Anfield]] where he scored two goals, his first for the club, in a 3\u20130 win against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 24 August 2002.<ref name=lfchistory>{{cite web|title=Diouf&nbsp;\u2013 Player profile|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/291|publisher=lfchistory.net|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> He started the [[2003 Football League Cup Final]] as Liverpool defeated [[Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2811805.stm|title=Liverpool lift Worthington Cup |publisher=BBC|date=2 March 2003 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool fans had to wait until March 2003 for Diouf's next goal for Liverpool.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Eunice, Ed and Mama come back from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters.

In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall.

In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Eunice, Ed and Mama come back from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

As a player, he spent twelve years in the top three of the world rankings.\n\n==Badminton career==\nDuring his career, Frost won almost every available top level championship, except the [[World Badminton Championships]] where he scored a silver medal twice (1985 and 1987). When he lost his second World Championship in the finals, the headlines rang out \"The World's greatest badminton player may never be World Champion.\"  While this may be the enduring footnote to his career, Frost dominated at the much coveted [[All England Open Badminton Championships]]. He won that tournament in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987. He also was European champion in 1984 and 1986. He won the Nordic championship each year from 1978 through 1984 and again in 1988.\n\nFrost is also distinguished by winning all of the invitational Grand Prix tournaments at least once, including his home country's [[Denmark Open]], of which he was champion 1980-1986 and 1989. Morten Frost represented Denmark on the [[Denmark national badminton team|national team]] from 1976 to 1991, longer than anyone else.\n\nNoted for his exceptionally smooth and fluid footwork, Frost's playing style was something of a cross between the traditional singles game featuring numerous clears (lobs) and drops, with smashes often reserved for weak returns, and the modern singles game featuring more smashing from the outset of a rally to create openings.\n\nMorten Frost was inducted into the [[Badminton Hall of Fame|BWF Badminton Hall of Fame]] in 1998.\n\n===Coaching career===\nAfter his playing years were over, he went on to successfully coach the [[Denmark|Danish]] national team. During his tenure as coach, the Danish national squad achieved over 20 major international wins, including an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal in 1996, six gold medals and three silver medals at the European Championships in 1996, the men's singles titles at the 1995 and 1996 All England Championships, and a gold, two silver and four bronze medals at the World Championships in 1995. He later coached the national teams of [[Malaysia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shuttler.tripod.com/shuttler/news/news005.htm | title=Danish legend Frost to coach South Africa |publisher=Shuttler| date=2001-03-30}}</ref> Frost also worked as a commentator on the [[BBC]]'s TV coverage of the badminton tournament at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://badmintonscotland.org.uk/index.php/press-media/3251-tune-in-to-the-beeb-for-badminton-at-glasgow-2014 |title=Tune in to the Beeb for badminton at Glasgow 2014 |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

As a player, he spent twelve years in the top three of the world rankings.\n\n==Badminton career==\nDuring his career, Frost won almost every available top level championship, except the [[World Badminton Championships]] where he scored a silver medal twice (1985 and 1987). When he lost his second World Championship in the finals, the headlines rang out \"The World's greatest badminton player may never be World Champion.\"  While this may be the enduring footnote to his career, Frost dominated at the much coveted [[All England Open Badminton Championships]]. He won that tournament in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987. He also was European champion in 1984 and 1986. He won the Nordic championship each year from 1978 through 1984 and again in 1988.\n\nFrost is also distinguished by winning all of the invitational Grand Prix tournaments at least once, including his home country's [[Denmark Open]], of which he was champion 1980-1986 and 1989. Morten Frost represented Denmark on the [[Denmark national badminton team|national team]] from 1976 to 1991, longer than anyone else.\n\nNoted for his exceptionally smooth and fluid footwork, Frost's playing style was something of a cross between the traditional singles game featuring numerous clears (lobs) and drops, with smashes often reserved for weak returns, and the modern singles game featuring more smashing from the outset of a rally to create openings.\n\nMorten Frost was inducted into the [[Badminton Hall of Fame|BWF Badminton Hall of Fame]] in 1998.\n\n===Coaching career===\nAfter his playing years were over, he went on to successfully coach the [[Denmark|Danish]] national team. During his tenure as coach, the Danish national squad achieved over 20 major international wins, including an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal in 1996, six gold medals and three silver medals at the European Championships in 1996, the men's singles titles at the 1995 and 1996 All England Championships, and a gold, two silver and four bronze medals at the World Championships in 1995. He later coached the national teams of [[Malaysia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shuttler.tripod.com/shuttler/news/news005.htm | title=Danish legend Frost to coach South Africa |publisher=Shuttler| date=2001-03-30}}</ref> Frost also worked as a commentator on the [[BBC]]'s TV coverage of the badminton tournament at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://badmintonscotland.org.uk/index.php/press-media/3251-tune-in-to-the-beeb-for-badminton-at-glasgow-2014 |title=Tune in to the Beeb for badminton at Glasgow 2014 |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

The ASWABde was a first attempt to unify the specialties of the Special Forces and the Scout Rangers, two army units that have among the most highly trained personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and structure their collective efforts into a highly effective army unit. Disbanded in 1986, it was reactivated as the PA SOCOM in 1995. It has been headquartered in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija since its reactivation, and was expanded in 2003 to accommodate the Light Reaction Regiment.\n\nThe current AFPSOCOM, which was elevated to an Armed Forces combatant command in April 2018, also includes units from the now disbanded AFP Joint Special Operations Group, raised in August 2003, and included not just the LRR, but the Naval Special Operations Group and the 710th Special Operations Wing. The AFP JSOG K-9 Platoon was carried over to the expanded command.\n\n==Unit mission==\nThe mission of the AFPSOCOM is to plan, conduct and support special operations in all operational environments in support of the fundamental missions of the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\n==Unit core capabilities==\nSOCOM forces are employed based on the following core capabilities:\n* Unconventional Warfare\n* Direct Action\n* Special Reconnaissance\n* International and domestic Counter-terrorist Operations\n* HVT Raids\n* Sabotage\n* Humanitarian Assistance/ Disaster Response\n* Security Assistance\n\n==Units==\nThe current AFP SOCOM is organized into:\n*[[Scout Ranger Regiment]]<ref>Dennis V.

Disbanded in 1986, it was reactivated as the PA SOCOM in 1995. It has been headquartered in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija since its reactivation, and was expanded in 2003 to accommodate the Light Reaction Regiment.\n\nThe current AFPSOCOM, which was elevated to an Armed Forces combatant command in April 2018, also includes units from the now disbanded AFP Joint Special Operations Group, raised in August 2003, and included not just the LRR, but the Naval Special Operations Group and the 710th Special Operations Wing. The AFP JSOG K-9 Platoon was carried over to the expanded command.\n\n==Unit mission==\nThe mission of the AFPSOCOM is to plan, conduct and support special operations in all operational environments in support of the fundamental missions of the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\n==Unit core capabilities==\nSOCOM forces are employed based on the following core capabilities:\n* Unconventional Warfare\n* Direct Action\n* Special Reconnaissance\n* International and domestic Counter-terrorist Operations\n* HVT Raids\n* Sabotage\n* Humanitarian Assistance/ Disaster Response\n* Security Assistance\n\n==Units==\nThe current AFP SOCOM is organized into:\n*[[Scout Ranger Regiment]]<ref>Dennis V.
