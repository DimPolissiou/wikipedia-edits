Due to a lack of Hispanic teachers in HISD at the time, HISD established the magnet program at Austin High School in order to have more Hispanic teachers in the schools; in 1984 7% of HISD's teachers were Hispanic even though 31% of its students were Hispanic. As of 1984 the magnet program required four years of English, three years each of social studies, science, and mathematics, and two years each of a foreign language and physical education.

The CHP has [[patrol]] [[jurisdiction]] over all [[State highways in California|California highways]].\n\nThe [[California State Legislature]] originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles|Division of Motor Vehicles]] in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor [[C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Young]] on August 14, 1929.  It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor [[Earl Warren]] in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller [[California State Police]] in 1995.<ref name=\"History of CHP; the CHP-CSP Merger\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/merger.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528021427/http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/merger.html|url-status=dead|title=History of CHP; the CHP-CSP Merger|archivedate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> It is currently organized as part of the [[California State Transportation Agency]] (CALSTA).\n\nIn addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the [[California State Capitol]]) and [[bodyguard|guarding]] state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is the largest state police agency in the [[United States]], with more than 10,700 employees, 7,500 of whom are sworn officers, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data.<ref name=\"table76\" />\n\n==Duties==\nThe agency is responsible for law enforcement on all California state routes (including all [[freeway]]s and [[Limited-access road|expressway]]s), [[U.S. Highway]]s, [[Interstate Highway]]s and all public roads in unincorporated and incorporated portions of a [[County (United States)|county]]. Local police or the local [[sheriff's department]] having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws in incorporated cities, but any peace officer of the CHP can still enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency's primary mission is related to transportation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=830.2.|publisher=[[California Office of Legislative Counsel]]|title=California Penal Code \u00a7 830.2(a)|accessdate=December 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, CHP officers act as [[bailiff]]s for the [[California Supreme Court]] and [[California Court of Appeal]], as well as providing security at buildings occupied by the State of California.\n\n[[File:CHP Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle.jpg|thumb|left|The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle replaced the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2013.]]\nCHP officers enforce the California Vehicle Code, pursue fugitives spotted on the highways, and attend to all significant obstructions and accidents within their jurisdiction. They patrol in various vehicles including 2011 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors (CVPI), 2014 & 2016 Ford Police Interceptor Utility (FPIU - Ford Explorer), 2015 Dodge Charger (AWD Package) and on rare occasions you might even see officers patrolling in 2015 Chevrolet Tahoes. The main vehicle that the CHP uses to patrol is actually the 2015 Dodge Charger in the AWD Police Package. CHP Officers have been using some police cars from the early 2000s such as Ford Expeditions.\n\nCHP officers are responsible for investigating and disposing of [[car accident]]s, disabled vehicles, debris, and other impediments to the free flow of traffic. They are often the first responders at the scene of an accident (or obstruction), and in turn summon [[paramedic]]s, [[firefighter]]s, [[tow truck]] drivers or [[Caltrans]] personnel. The CHP files traffic collision reports for state highways and within unincorporated areas. The CHP responds to and investigates all accidents involving [[school bus]]es throughout the state including incorporated cities.\n\nCHP also has Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Teams (MAIT) for the investigation of traffic collisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/for-law-enforcement/multidisciplinary-accident-investigation-teams-(mait)|title=Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Teams (MAIT)|website=www.chp.ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Special responsibilities==\n\nThe CHP also publishes data on traffic accidents in California from a database called SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System).\n[[File:CHP-Swat-Team.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the CHP SWAT Team]]\nAfter the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the CHP became responsible for securing and patrolling a number of potential terrorist targets in California. These sites include nuclear power plants, government buildings, and key [[infrastructure]] sites. The CHP also maintains a [[SWAT]] team on 24\u2011hour stand\u2011by to respond to any terrorist activity.\n\nIn September 2005, the CHP sent its two Mobile Field Forces (highly trained and equipped quick reaction/deployment teams for civil disturbances and/or disasters) to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] to assist in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Cold weather and utility uniforms are dark blue.[[File:CHP STRAW HAT.jpg|thumb|right|California Highway Patrol campaign hat.]] Leather gear is black basketweave leather with brass snaps and buckles.\n\nStandard traffic enforcement patrol vehicles are required by state law to have a white door with, in the case of the CHP, a star.

With the falling cost of [[telephone]] [[area code]] 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP's traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11\u201199, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down.\n\nIn 1981, a charitable foundation called the 11\u201199 Foundation was founded to provide benefits and scholarships to officers and their families. The members of the foundation's board of directors have provided over $16&nbsp;million in assistance to current, retired, and those fallen in the line of duty CHP employees and their families.

Since the CHP has no jurisdiction directly in [[Mexico]], officers from the Unit work closely with Mexican authorities to recover [[Motor vehicle theft|stolen vehicles]] and assist with other law enforcement issues. The purpose of the \"Mexico Liaison Unit\" is to develop and maintain positive working relations with Mexican authorities in order to:\n* Locate and identify stolen U.S.&nbsp;vehicles taken to Mexico\n* Identify vehicle thieves and ensure their prosecution, either in Mexico or California\n* Provide assistance to Mexican and U.S. authorities\n\nThe unit was originally established in 1958 and only consisted of one officer. It was discontinued in the 1970s, and reestablished in 1980.

The incident is a landmark in CHP history because of both its emotional impact and the procedural and doctrinal reforms implemented by the CHP in the incident's aftermath.\n\nThe shootout occurred in a restaurant parking lot just before midnight. Officers Walt Frago and Roger Gore were alerted by radio of a vehicle carrying someone who brandished a weapon. They spotted the car, fell in behind, called for backup, and began the stop procedure. When the suspects' vehicle came to a halt in the parking lot, the driver was instructed to step out of the vehicle and spread his hands on the hood. Gore approached him and Frago moved to the passenger side. The passenger side door suddenly swung open and the passenger sprung out, firing at Frago, who fell with two shots in his chest. The gunman, later identified as Jack Twinning, then turned and fired once at Gore, who returned fire. In that moment the driver, Bobby Davis, turned and shot Gore twice at close range. Both officers died instantly.\n\nWhen Officers James Pence and George Alleyn drove in moments later, they could not see suspects or other officers, but both immediately came under fire. Pence put out an 11\u201199 call (\"officer needs help, emergency\") then took cover behind the passenger door. Alleyn grabbed his shotgun, and positioned himself behind the driver-side door. Both officers were mortally wounded in the ensuing exchange, and one suspect was hit.\n\nCivilian [[Newhall massacre|Gary Kness]] saw the gunfight as he drove along The Old Road and stopped to help. Kness ran toward the gun battle as shots were still being fired.\n\n\"I was driving to work as a computer operator when I turned the corner on the Old Road and saw the gunfire, I saw two CHP cars and a red car.

When one of the two assailants began firing at him, Kness grabbed a CHP shotgun lying on the ground and aimed it at one of the gunmen. The shotgun was empty, however. Kness grabbed Alleyn's service pistol from the ground, aimed with both hands and fired, hitting gunman Bobby Augusta Davis in the chest. When Davis kept advancing toward him, Kness tried to shoot again, but the CHP pistol was out of bullets.\n\n\"I was upset there weren't four or five more rounds in there. After that, I ran and jumped in a ditch. The dumbest thing is, I still had the service revolver in my hand. I was afraid when more police came they'd think I was one of the gunman. So I put it behind me and said, 'They went that way.'\"<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\nSuspects Jack Twinning and Bobby Davis escaped, later abandoned their vehicle and then split up. For nine hours, officers blanketed the area searching for the killers. Twinning broke into a house and briefly held a man hostage. Officers used tear gas before storming the house, but Twinning committed suicide with the shotgun he stole from Frago. Davis was captured, stood trial and convicted on four counts of murder. He was sentenced to death, but in 1972, the California Supreme Court declared the [[death penalty]] to be cruel and unusual punishment and in 1973, the court commuted his sentence to life in prison.\n\nOf the incident, Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California at the time, said the following words: \"If anything worthwhile comes of this tragedy, it should be the realization by every citizen that often the only thing that stands between them and losing everything they hold dear&nbsp;... is the man wearing a badge.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Anderson\n| first = John\n| author2=Marsh Cassady\n| title = ''The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre''\n| publisher = Quill Driver Books\n| year = 1998\n| isbn = 978-1-884956-01-0}}</ref>\n\nA follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops.

After 100,000 miles, the warranty on CHP vehicles expires, forcing CHP to pay for maintenance costs.  In July 2013, the CHP was authorized to purchase up to 751 new vehicles to begin replacing its aging fleet, starting with cars that have the highest mileage.\n\nThrough a public, competitive bidding process, the [[Ford Explorer#Ford Police Interceptor Utility|Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle (Explorer)]] was selected as the new enforcement vehicle for the CHP in 2013.  The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle is All Wheel Drive and powered by a V6, 3.7 Liter engine.  It is a Flex Fuel vehicle that can use gasoline or E85 and gets 16 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.\n\nSeveral [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger Police Packages]] were also purchased for testing.\n\nThe [[Ford Crown Victoria]] Police Interceptor averaged 14 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.  The new Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle costs $26,578, which includes a 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The Department was paying $24,043 for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to maintain all vehicles no longer covered by warranty.\nSeveral vehicles were allocated to public affairs officers and are used for recruiting purposes. An example of these vehicles can be seen at the [[California State Fair]] and other venues. CHP also uses [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s, [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Rams]] (for commercial vehicle enforcement), [[Ford Expedition]]s, and [[Dodge Durango]]s for their divisions that snow frequently or have certain terrains to permit off-road driving.\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that the CHP would be taking delivery of 516 [[Dodge Charger (LX)|2016 Dodge Chargers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CHP Adds Dodge Chargers for Highway Enforcement|url=http://www.government-fleet.com/news/story/2016/05/chp-adds-dodge-chargers-for-highway-enforcement.aspx|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=May 6, 2016}}</ref> These cars are hoped to be more reliable than the Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle, which have been plagued with various recalls and breakdowns, most notably, transmission failures.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that the CHP were going to start using [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] Police Patrol Vehicles (PPV) for rural and [[resident posts]].  This is because of their ability to carry a larger \"basic load\" of normal issue equipment, equipment that may be only in a few cars, and / or not carried by patrol cars at all, in a more urban setting.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[Image:CHP Helicopter.jpg|thumb|CHP AS 350 B3 in flight.]]\n\nThe CHP utilizes both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

He had reported finding a dead body off a deserted stretch of [[interstate 15]] the same day he murdered her with his service weapon. Gwaltney was tried twice for this murder at the [[San Bernardino County Court House]]. The first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 8\u20134 and the second 7\u20135. The district attorney attempted to try Gwaltney a third time, but a Superior court judge dismissed the murder charge. Since Gwaltney was allowed to go free for the first two state trials, the [[FBI]] took over the case. The FBI was able to piece together the events leading up to the slaying and the on-duty rape of Robin Bishop and interrogating Gwaltney's alibi, Preston Olson and his mother. There was more forensic evidence that the FBI succeeded in getting to build their case against Gwaltney; soon his story started to fall apart. After the six-month investigation by the [[FBI]], George Michael Gwaltney was arrested in Barstow and tried at the US District Court in Los Angeles. He was represented by a public defender who chose not to have Gwaltney testify as he had done in the previous two state trials. He was found guilty of the slaying, rape and the deprivation of Robin Bishop's civil rights while on duty. He was the first California Highway Patrol officer to be charged with the indictment of violating the civil rights of Robin Bishop as well as being the first CHP officer to commit a murder while on duty. Following the conviction, Gwaltney was subsequently sentenced to 90 years in prison, being eligible for parole after serving at least 30 years. Gwaltney died in federal custody from a [[heart attack]] in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://suzukisthoughts.blogspot.com/2019/10/bad-cop-george-gwaltney-and-problem.html|title=Bad Cop: George Gwaltney and the Problem of Police Accountability}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/790/1378/8638/ |title=790 F.2d 1378: United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

He was charged with oral copulation with a minor under 14, lewd acts with a child under 14, continuous sexual abuse of a child, penetration with a foreign object and rape. The [[Amador County Sheriff's Department]] was tipped off by a local Church pastor after the victim and her mother came forward with the alleged abuse. The Amador County Sheriff's detectives and the department learned that the alleged molestation had been taking place for the past year. Joslin was employed with the California Highway Patrol Amador area office until August 14, when he was removed from the position. From July 1, 2009, until March 2, 2016, he was employed at the San Andreas area office. He graduated from the CHP Academy in West Sacramento on June 18, 2007. Joslin appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to the charges he had against him and was ordered to turn in his firearms. A protective order was imposed on Joslin in court, prohibiting him from contacting the victim in any capacity. He was held at the [[Amador County Jail]].\n\nOn March 4, 2019, Joslin plead guilty to one count of sexual penetration by foreign object and one count of rape by force or fear in exchange for the remaining charges being dismissed. On April 16, he was sentenced to a total of 19 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledger.news/news/local_news/former-chp-officer-sentenced-in-child-sexual-abuse-case/article_d6efb560-6221-11e9-ac57-4fe826954560.html|title=Former CHP Officer Sentenced in Child Sexual Abuse Case|first=Craig|last=Baracco|website=Ledger Dispatch}}</ref> Joslin will be eligible for parole in 2033.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/default.aspx|title=CDCR Public Inmate Locator Disclaimer|website=inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Programs==\nThe CHP hosts or partners with numerous programs for public safety education and community involvement.\n\n===Youth programs===\n* Start Smart \u2013 a class for prospective and new teen drivers\n* [[Every 15 Minutes]] \u2013 a two-day anti-drunk driving presentation for high school students\n* [[Impact Teen Drivers]] \u2013 a nonprofit against teen distracted driving that is partnered with the CHP\n* Make the Right Turn \u2013 aimed at educating 11- to 14-year-olds about drugs and peer [[pressure]]\n* CHP Explorer Program \u2013 A law enforcement career exploration program for teenagers ages 15\u201321 years old who are interested in becoming a CHP Officer. \n* Sober Graduation \u2013 promoting sober driving and the use of a [[designated driver]] for teens\n* [[Red Ribbon Week]] \u2013 a week in October dedicated to education about the dangers of illicit drugs for students of all ages\n\n===Vehicle Theft Recognition and Awards Program===\n* 10851 Award for Superior Efforts in Vehicle Theft Arrests and Recovery.

The consensus was for the name \"California Highway Patrol\". The [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA) is a private organization which provided, among other things, roadside assistance to their members. At that time, the AAA had a fleet of trucks which patrolled the roads so they could assist their members. These trucks carried a sign which said \"Highway Patrol\". The CHP organizers decided it would be best to contact the AAA to see if they would object to the state using this name. The AAA considered the idea, and gave their consent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanindian.net/traffica.html|title=California Highway Patrol (CHP) terminology|website=www.americanindian.net}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|California}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Highway patrol]]\n* [[List of law enforcement agencies in California]]\n* [[State patrol]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* Crane, Bob, ''California Association of Highway Patrolmen Golden Chronicle 1920\u20131970'', (Sacramento, California: California Association of Highway Patrolmen, 1970).\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.chp.ca.gov/}}\n* [http://cad.chp.ca.gov/ CHP Traffic Incident Information Page]\n* [http://www.chpcareers.com/ CHP recruitment website]\n* [http://www.thecahp.org/ California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) website]\n\n{{SPHPbystate}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:State law enforcement agencies of California]]\n[[Category:Transportation in California|Highway Patrol]]\n[[Category:California Highway Patrol| ]]\n[[Category:Local government in California]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1929]]\n[[Category:1929 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the California Highway Patrol (CHP)|the California State Police (CSP)|California State Police}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{short description|Law enforcement agency in California, USA}}\n{{Infobox law enforcement agency|doc=autocat off\n| agencyname      = California Highway Patrol\n| nativename      =\n| nativenamea     =\n| nativenamer     =\n| commonname      =\n| abbreviation    = CHP\n| fictional       =\n| patch           = Patch of the California Highway Patrol.png\n| patchcaption    = CHP Patch\n| logo            = CHP Door Insignia.png\n| logocaption     = CHP Door Shield\n| badge           = CHP Badge.png\n| badgecaption    = CHP Badge\n| flag            = Logo of the California Highway Patrol.svg\n| flagcaption     = CHP Logo\n| imagesize       =\n| motto           = Safety, Service, and Security\n| mottotranslated =\n| mission         =\n| formed          = {{Start date and age|1929|8|14|y=df}}\n| preceding1      =\n| dissolved       =\n| superseding     =\n| employees       = 11,000 (as of 2019)<ref name=\"table76\">''[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-76]''</ref>\n| volunteers      =\n| budget          = $2.8&nbsp;billion (as of 2020)\n| nongovernment   =\n| country         = United States\n| countryabbr     = U.S.\n| national        =\n| federal         =\n| international   =\n| divtype         = State\n| divname         = California\n| divdab          =\n| subdivtype      =\n| subdivname      =\n| subdivdab       =\n| map             = CA -

The CHP has [[patrol]] [[jurisdiction]] over all [[State highways in California|California highways]] and are also known as the [[State police (United States)|state police]]. They also have jurisdiction over city roads, and have the right to conduct law enforcement procedures there.\n\nThe [[California State Legislature]] originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles|Division of Motor Vehicles]] in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor [[C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Young]] on August 14, 1929.  It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor [[Earl Warren]] in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller [[California State Police]] in 1995.<ref name=\"History of CHP; the CHP-CSP Merger\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/merger.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528021427/http://www.chp.ca.gov/html/merger.html|url-status=dead|title=History of CHP; the CHP-CSP Merger|archivedate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> It is currently organized as part of the [[California State Transportation Agency]] (CALSTA).\n\nIn addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the [[California State Capitol]]) and [[bodyguard|guarding]] state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is the largest state police agency in the [[United States]], with more than 10,700 employees, 7,500 of whom are sworn officers, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data.<ref name=\"table76\" />\n\n==Duties==\nThe agency is responsible for law enforcement on all California state routes (including all [[freeway]]s and [[Limited-access road|expressway]]s), [[U.S. Highway]]s, [[Interstate Highway]]s and all public roads in unincorporated and incorporated portions of a [[County (United States)|county]]. Local police or the local [[sheriff's department]] having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws in incorporated cities, but any peace officer of the CHP can still enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency's primary mission is related to transportation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=830.2.|publisher=[[California Office of Legislative Counsel]]|title=California Penal Code \u00a7 830.2(a)|accessdate=December 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, CHP officers act as [[bailiff]]s for the [[California Supreme Court]] and [[California Court of Appeal]], as well as providing security at buildings occupied by the State of California.\n\n[[File:CHP Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle.jpg|thumb|left|The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle replaced the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2013.]]\nCHP officers enforce the California Vehicle Code, pursue fugitives spotted on the highways, and attend to all significant obstructions and accidents within their jurisdiction. They patrol in various vehicles including 2011 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors (CVPI), 2014 & 2016 Ford Police Interceptor Utility (FPIU - Ford Explorer), 2015 Dodge Charger (AWD Package) and on rare occasions you might even see officers patrolling in 2015 Chevrolet Tahoes. The main vehicle that the CHP uses to patrol is actually the 2015 Dodge Charger in the AWD Police Package. CHP Officers have been using some police cars from the early 2000s such as Ford Expeditions.\n\nCHP officers are responsible for investigating and disposing of [[car accident]]s, disabled vehicles, debris, and other impediments to the free flow of traffic. They are often the first responders at the scene of an accident (or obstruction), and in turn summon [[paramedic]]s, [[firefighter]]s, [[tow truck]] drivers or [[Caltrans]] personnel. The CHP files traffic collision reports for state highways and within unincorporated areas. The CHP responds to and investigates all accidents involving [[school bus]]es throughout the state including incorporated cities.\n\nCHP also has Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Teams (MAIT) for the investigation of traffic collisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/for-law-enforcement/multidisciplinary-accident-investigation-teams-(mait)|title=Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Teams (MAIT)|website=www.chp.ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Special responsibilities==\n\nThe CHP also publishes data on traffic accidents in California from a database called SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System).\n[[File:CHP-Swat-Team.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the CHP SWAT Team]]\nAfter the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] the CHP became responsible for securing and patrolling a number of potential terrorist targets in California. These sites include nuclear power plants, government buildings, and key [[infrastructure]] sites. The CHP also maintains a [[SWAT]] team on 24\u2011hour stand\u2011by to respond to any terrorist activity.\n\nIn September 2005, the CHP sent its two Mobile Field Forces (highly trained and equipped quick reaction/deployment teams for civil disturbances and/or disasters) to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] to assist in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Before the [[United States National Guard]] arrived, the CHP had four patrol [[helicopter]]s over [[Marianna, Florida]], more than eighty vehicles on the ground, and more than 200 officers and other staff, including a SWAT team, deployed in New Orleans.<ref>News Release 05-42, Media Relations Office, California Highway Patrol, September 29, 2005</ref>\n\nThe CHP also has officers assigned to drug task forces and other criminal investigative task forces throughout the state, and maintains highly trained Warrant Service Teams (WST) throughout each of its Divisions.

With the falling cost of [[telephone]] [[area code]] 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP's traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11\u201199, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down.\n\nIn 1981, a charitable foundation called the 11\u201199 Foundation was founded to provide benefits and scholarships to officers and their families. The members of the foundation's board of directors have provided over $16&nbsp;million in assistance to current, retired, and those fallen in the line of duty CHP employees and their families.

The incident is a landmark in CHP history because of both its emotional impact and the procedural and doctrinal reforms implemented by the CHP in the incident's aftermath.\n\nThe shootout occurred in a restaurant parking lot just before midnight. Officers Walt Frago and Roger Gore were alerted by radio of a vehicle carrying someone who brandished a weapon. They spotted the car, fell in behind, called for backup, and began the stop procedure. When the suspects' vehicle came to a halt in the parking lot, the driver was instructed to step out of the vehicle and spread his hands on the hood. Gore approached him and Frago moved to the passenger side. The passenger side door suddenly swung open and the passenger sprung out, firing at Frago, who fell with two shots in his chest. The gunman, later identified as Jack Twinning, then turned and fired once at Gore, who returned fire. In that moment the driver, Bobby Davis, turned and shot Gore twice at close range. Both officers died instantly.\n\nWhen Officers James Pence and George Alleyn drove in moments later, they could not see suspects or other officers, but both immediately came under fire. Pence put out an 11\u201199 call (\"officer needs help, emergency\") then took cover behind the passenger door. Alleyn grabbed his shotgun, and positioned himself behind the driver-side door. Both officers were mortally wounded in the ensuing exchange, and one suspect was hit.\n\nCivilian [[Newhall massacre|Gary Kness]] saw the gunfight as he drove along The Old Road and stopped to help. Kness ran toward the gun battle as shots were still being fired.\n\n\"I was driving to work as a computer operator when I turned the corner on the Old Road and saw the gunfire, I saw two CHP cars and a red car.

When one of the two assailants began firing at him, Kness grabbed a CHP shotgun lying on the ground and aimed it at one of the gunmen. The shotgun was empty, however. Kness grabbed Alleyn's service pistol from the ground, aimed with both hands and fired, hitting gunman Bobby Augusta Davis in the chest. When Davis kept advancing toward him, Kness tried to shoot again, but the CHP pistol was out of bullets.\n\n\"I was upset there weren't four or five more rounds in there. After that, I ran and jumped in a ditch. The dumbest thing is, I still had the service revolver in my hand. I was afraid when more police came they'd think I was one of the gunman. So I put it behind me and said, 'They went that way.'\"<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\nSuspects Jack Twinning and Bobby Davis escaped, later abandoned their vehicle and then split up. For nine hours, officers blanketed the area searching for the killers. Twinning broke into a house and briefly held a man hostage. Officers used tear gas before storming the house, but Twinning committed suicide with the shotgun he stole from Frago. Davis was captured, stood trial and convicted on four counts of murder. He was sentenced to death, but in 1972, the California Supreme Court declared the [[death penalty]] to be cruel and unusual punishment and in 1973, the court commuted his sentence to life in prison.\n\nOf the incident, Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California at the time, said the following words: \"If anything worthwhile comes of this tragedy, it should be the realization by every citizen that often the only thing that stands between them and losing everything they hold dear&nbsp;... is the man wearing a badge.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Anderson\n| first = John\n| author2=Marsh Cassady\n| title = ''The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre''\n| publisher = Quill Driver Books\n| year = 1998\n| isbn = 978-1-884956-01-0}}</ref>\n\nA follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops.

The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle is All Wheel Drive and powered by a V6, 3.7 Liter engine.  It is a Flex Fuel vehicle that can use gasoline or E85 and gets 16 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.\n\nSeveral [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger Police Packages]] were also purchased for testing.\n\nThe [[Ford Crown Victoria]] Police Interceptor averaged 14 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.  The new Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle costs $26,578, which includes a 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The Department was paying $24,043 for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to maintain all vehicles no longer covered by warranty.\nSeveral vehicles were allocated to public affairs officers and are used for recruiting purposes. An example of these vehicles can be seen at the [[California State Fair]] and other venues. CHP also uses [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s, [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Rams]] (for commercial vehicle enforcement), [[Ford Expedition]]s, and [[Dodge Durango]]s for their divisions that snow frequently or have certain terrains to permit off-road driving.\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that the CHP would be taking delivery of 516 [[Dodge Charger (LX)|2016 Dodge Chargers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CHP Adds Dodge Chargers for Highway Enforcement|url=http://www.government-fleet.com/news/story/2016/05/chp-adds-dodge-chargers-for-highway-enforcement.aspx|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=May 6, 2016}}</ref> These cars are hoped to be more reliable than the Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle, which have been plagued with various recalls and breakdowns, most notably, transmission failures.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that the CHP were going to start using [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] Police Patrol Vehicles (PPV) for rural and [[resident posts]].  This is because of their ability to carry a larger \"basic load\" of normal issue equipment, equipment that may be only in a few cars, and / or not carried by patrol cars at all, in a more urban setting.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[Image:CHP Helicopter.jpg|thumb|CHP AS 350 B3 in flight.]]\n\nThe CHP utilizes both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. In January 2020, the fleet consisted of:<ref>{{cite web|title=FAA Registry|url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=CALIFORNIA+HIGHWAY+PATROL&sort_option=1&PageNo=1|accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n*13 [[Eurocopter AS350 \u00c9cureuil|Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter) AS350B3 Squirrel]]s\n*8 [[Cessna 206|Cessna T206H Turbo Stationair]]s\n*7 [[GippsAero GA8 Airvan|Gippsaero GA8 TC-320 Airvan]]s\n*1 [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Raytheon (Beechcraft) B300 Super King Air]]\n\n==Rogue officers==\n===George Gwaltney===\nA former officer from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], was convicted on May 10, 1984 in federal court for the on\u2011duty [[rape]] and slaying of 23-year-old Robin Bishop on January 11, 1982. He had reported finding a dead body off a deserted stretch of [[interstate 15]] the same day he murdered her with his service weapon. Gwaltney was tried twice for this murder at the [[San Bernardino County Court House]]. The first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 8\u20134 and the second 7\u20135. The district attorney attempted to try Gwaltney a third time, but a Superior court judge dismissed the murder charge. Since Gwaltney was allowed to go free for the first two state trials, the [[FBI]] took over the case. The FBI was able to piece together the events leading up to the slaying and the on-duty rape of Robin Bishop and interrogating Gwaltney's alibi, Preston Olson and his mother. There was more forensic evidence that the FBI succeeded in getting to build their case against Gwaltney; soon his story started to fall apart. After the six-month investigation by the [[FBI]], George Michael Gwaltney was arrested in Barstow and tried at the US District Court in Los Angeles. He was represented by a public defender who chose not to have Gwaltney testify as he had done in the previous two state trials. He was found guilty of the slaying, rape and the deprivation of Robin Bishop's civil rights while on duty. He was the first California Highway Patrol officer to be charged with the indictment of violating the civil rights of Robin Bishop as well as being the first CHP officer to commit a murder while on duty. Following the conviction, Gwaltney was subsequently sentenced to 90 years in prison, being eligible for parole after serving at least 30 years. Gwaltney died in federal custody from a [[heart attack]] in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://suzukisthoughts.blogspot.com/2019/10/bad-cop-george-gwaltney-and-problem.html|title=Bad Cop: George Gwaltney and the Problem of Police Accountability}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/790/1378/8638/ |title=790 F.2d 1378: United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

After she was killed, Knott's body was discarded over an abandoned highway bridge. Peyer was convicted of [[first-degree murder]] in 1988. Though he has maintained innocence ever since, Peyer has been denied parole consistently.<ref>[http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/15188876/detail.html?subid=10101561 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> In 2004, the parole board offered Peyer the chance to prove his alleged innocence by providing a [[DNA]] sample to compare against a drop of blood found on Cara's shoe, using modern [[DNA profiling]].

He had a weapon and the store owner was going to call 911 before he shot the owner, his wife, and himself. The owner managed to escape despite his injury and called 911.

He was charged with oral copulation with a minor under 14, lewd acts with a child under 14, continuous sexual abuse of a child, penetration with a foreign object and rape. The [[Amador County Sheriff's Department]] was tipped off by a local Church pastor after the victim and her mother came forward with the alleged abuse. The Amador County Sheriff's detectives and the department learned that the alleged molestation had been taking place for the past year. Joslin was employed with the California Highway Patrol Amador area office until August 14, when he was removed from the position. From July 1, 2009, until March 2, 2016, he was employed at the San Andreas area office. He graduated from the CHP Academy in West Sacramento on June 18, 2007. Joslin appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to the charges he had against him and was ordered to turn in his firearms. A protective order was imposed on Joslin in court, prohibiting him from contacting the victim in any capacity. He was held at the [[Amador County Jail]].\n\nOn March 4, 2019, Joslin plead guilty to one count of sexual penetration by foreign object and one count of rape by force or fear in exchange for the remaining charges being dismissed. On April 16, he was sentenced to a total of 19 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledger.news/news/local_news/former-chp-officer-sentenced-in-child-sexual-abuse-case/article_d6efb560-6221-11e9-ac57-4fe826954560.html|title=Former CHP Officer Sentenced in Child Sexual Abuse Case|first=Craig|last=Baracco|website=Ledger Dispatch}}</ref> Joslin will be eligible for parole in 2033.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/default.aspx|title=CDCR Public Inmate Locator Disclaimer|website=inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Programs==\nThe CHP hosts or partners with numerous programs for public safety education and community involvement.\n\n===Youth programs===\n* Start Smart \u2013 a class for prospective and new teen drivers\n* [[Every 15 Minutes]] \u2013 a two-day anti-drunk driving presentation for high school students\n* [[Impact Teen Drivers]] \u2013 a nonprofit against teen distracted driving that is partnered with the CHP\n* Make the Right Turn \u2013 aimed at educating 11- to 14-year-olds about drugs and peer [[pressure]]\n* CHP Explorer Program \u2013 A law enforcement career exploration program for teenagers ages 15\u201321 years old who are interested in becoming a CHP Officer. \n* Sober Graduation \u2013 promoting sober driving and the use of a [[designated driver]] for teens\n* [[Red Ribbon Week]] \u2013 a week in October dedicated to education about the dangers of illicit drugs for students of all ages\n\n===Vehicle Theft Recognition and Awards Program===\n* 10851 Award for Superior Efforts in Vehicle Theft Arrests and Recovery.

The CHP, in conjunction with the California State Automobile Association, presented an estimated 2,009 awards in 1995 to the more than 170 allied agencies participating in the 10851 Awards Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chp.ca.gov/notify-chp/auto-theft|title=Auto Theft|website=www.chp.ca.gov}}</ref>\n<gallery>\n10851 CA.jpg|California Highway Patrol 10851 Award Pin\n</gallery>\n\n===Other programs===\n* Highway Safety Corridor Program \u2013 promoting caution on roads with high accident rates\n* Senior Volunteer Program \u2013  Citizens ages 55 and older can volunteer their time to help the CHP out in their community. \n* Designated Driver Program \u2013 program to reduce drunk driving incidents through using a [[designated driver]]\n\n==Origins of the name==\nWhen the CHP was formed, there were discussions as to what to call this new agency. The consensus was for the name \"California Highway Patrol\". The [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA) is a private organization which provided, among other things, roadside assistance to their members. At that time, the AAA had a fleet of trucks which patrolled the roads so they could assist their members. These trucks carried a sign which said \"Highway Patrol\". The CHP organizers decided it would be best to contact the AAA to see if they would object to the state using this name. The AAA considered the idea, and gave their consent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanindian.net/traffica.html|title=California Highway Patrol (CHP) terminology|website=www.americanindian.net}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|California}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Highway patrol]]\n* [[List of law enforcement agencies in California]]\n* [[State patrol]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* Crane, Bob, ''California Association of Highway Patrolmen Golden Chronicle 1920\u20131970'', (Sacramento, California: California Association of Highway Patrolmen, 1970).\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.chp.ca.gov/}}\n* [http://cad.chp.ca.gov/ CHP Traffic Incident Information Page]\n* [http://www.chpcareers.com/ CHP recruitment website]\n* [http://www.thecahp.org/ California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) website]\n\n{{SPHPbystate}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:State law enforcement agencies of California]]\n[[Category:Transportation in California|Highway Patrol]]\n[[Category:California Highway Patrol| ]]\n[[Category:Local government in California]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1929]]\n[[Category:1929 establishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "47.6.110.78", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Highway_Patrol"}

Formed in 1981 with the line-up of Bannister (guitar & vocals), David Pine (guitar & vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar & vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums & vocals), Tyrie was replaced by Kelcher in 1983. Durrant was temporarily replaced by [[Ross Burge]] from 1988-1992 but later returned, maintaining the line up of Bannister, Pine, Kelcher and Durrant which continues. \n\nSneaky Feelings are unusual among [[Dunedin sound]] bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beatles]], and comparisons can be made with some of California's [[Paisley Underground]] bands. \n\nThe band's name comes from a song by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Sneaky Feelings\", which is on his first album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977).\n\n==History==\nSneaky Feelings were one of four [[Dunedin]] bands to reap the benefits of the newly formed Flying Nun label with the release of the ''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]'' EP in 1982, alongside [[the Stones (New Zealand band)|the Stones]], [[the Verlaines]] and [[the Chills]]. Sneaky Feelings were drawn to a wider variety of musical styles than most early Flying Nun bands and were one of the first to experiment in the recording studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELING Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However the multi-voiced harmonies of the band's sound were not well-suited to the primitive recording conditions of early Flying Nun, so it is rarely captured at its best on the albums they released. The band's biggest hit has been their single \"Husband House\" in 1985, which reached #16 on NZ charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news/sneaky-feelings-announce-new-album-the-mercury-moment/2020?rq=Sneaky%20Feelings|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of Sneaky Feelings in 1989, Bannister moved to Auckland where he founded the [[Dribbling Darts of Love|Dribbling Darts]]. He later worked briefly with [[the Mutton Birds]] alongside Ross Burge. Subsequently Bannister formed the band [[The Weather (band)|The Weather]]. He also wrote a book about the experience of being in a band during the heyday of the Dunedin sound movement - ''Positively George Street''. Pine has returned sporadically to music, notably in the Dunedin-based band Death Ray Cafe in the late 1980s, but his involvement in music has been largely curtailed by his work in the New Zealand diplomatic corps ({{As of|2012|lc=y}} he is New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners from New Zealand to Malaysia|High Commissioner in Malaysia]]). Sneaky Feelings briefly re-formed in 1992 to record several extra tracks and to tour to promote the CD release of ''[[Send You]]''. They also re-formed to perform a one-off concert as part of a celebration of Dunedin music, held in that city in 2006. In early 2008, Kelcher formed The South Tonight with Richard James, who had also been in an early Flying Nun group, Mainly Spaniards. Kelcher later stood as a candidate for the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] in the [[2014 New Zealand general election]], for the Christchurch seat of [[Ilam (New Zealand electorate)|Ilam]].\n\nWhile Sneaky Feelings may have not played much over the years, the individual members have continued to hone their songwriting skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After a 29 year hiatus, the band released Progress Junction in 2017.

These songs are melodic and poetic, and often employ humour even when the subject is serious.\" He continued \"But they are not the only writers in the group. This band has always appeared to be that rare institution, a functioning democracy. All four members contribute songs, and in the past some of the best ones came from drummer Martin Durrant. It was his \u2018Strangers Again\u2019 that [[Bic Runga]] covered so beautifully on her rarities set ''[[Try to Remember Everything|Try To Remember Everything]]'', and his \u2018You Never Know\u2019 is one of the standouts on this record. It could almost be some pre-rock\u2019n\u2019roll, [[Great American Songbook]] classic as interpreted by a 60s beat group.

It was released 17th April 2020 on Flying Nun Records and the quartet's [[Bandcamp]] page. They announced the forthcoming 12 song LP after a rare performance on [[Waitangi Day]] 2020. The Mercury Moment is a \"...potent exploration of extinction, redundancy and disappointed dreams as the four songwriters cast their attention on the current state of the world.

Formed in 1981 with the line-up of Bannister (guitar & vocals), David Pine (guitar & vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar & vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums & vocals), Tyrie was replaced by Kelcher in 1983. Durrant was temporarily replaced by [[Ross Burge]] from 1988-1992 but later returned, maintaining the line up of Bannister, Pine, Kelcher and Durrant which continues. \n\nSneaky Feelings are unusual among [[Dunedin sound]] bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beatles]], and comparisons can be made with some of California's [[Paisley Underground]] bands. \n\nThe band's name comes from a song by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Sneaky Feelings\", which is on his first album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977).\n\n==History==\nSneaky Feelings were one of four [[Dunedin]] bands to reap the benefits of the newly formed Flying Nun label with the release of the ''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]'' EP in 1982, alongside [[the Stones (New Zealand band)|the Stones]], [[the Verlaines]] and [[the Chills]]. Sneaky Feelings were drawn to a wider variety of musical styles than most early Flying Nun bands and were one of the first to experiment in the recording studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELING Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However the multi-voiced harmonies of the band's sound were not well-suited to the primitive recording conditions of early Flying Nun, so it is rarely captured at its best on the albums they released. The band's biggest hit has been their single \"Husband House\" in 1985, which reached #16 on NZ charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news/sneaky-feelings-announce-new-album-the-mercury-moment/2020?rq=Sneaky%20Feelings|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of Sneaky Feelings in 1989, Bannister moved to Auckland where he founded the [[Dribbling Darts of Love|Dribbling Darts]]. He later worked briefly with [[the Mutton Birds]] alongside Ross Burge. Subsequently Bannister formed the band [[The Weather (band)|The Weather]]. He also wrote a book about the experience of being in a band during the heyday of the Dunedin sound movement - ''Positively George Street''. Pine has returned sporadically to music, notably in the Dunedin-based band Death Ray Cafe in the late 1980s, but his involvement in music has been largely curtailed by his work in the New Zealand diplomatic corps ({{As of|2012|lc=y}} he is New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners from New Zealand to Malaysia|High Commissioner in Malaysia]]). Sneaky Feelings briefly re-formed in 1992 to record several extra tracks and to tour to promote the CD release of ''[[Send You]]''. They also re-formed to perform a one-off concert as part of a celebration of Dunedin music, held in that city in 2006. In early 2008, Kelcher formed The South Tonight with Richard James, who had also been in an early Flying Nun group, Mainly Spaniards. Kelcher later stood as a candidate for the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] in the [[2014 New Zealand general election]], for the Christchurch seat of [[Ilam (New Zealand electorate)|Ilam]].\n\nWhile Sneaky Feelings may have not played much over the years, the individual members have continued to hone their songwriting skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After a 29 year hiatus, the band released Progress Junction in 2017. It was recorded over two years in bass player John Kelcher\u2019s Christchurch studio, with each band member contributing three tracks. They experimented with weaving in snippets of audio from New Zealand radio archives and voices from the past started talking to the present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS\nProgress Junction\nFlying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Progress Junction received wide praise from critics at home, including Sunday Star Time\u2019s Jack Barlow who dubbed it ''\u201ca vibrant and fresh offering from one of New Zealand\u2019s finest\u201d'' to William Dart (RNZ New Horizons ) who referred to the album as ''\u201cthe unexpected renaissance of one of my favourite bands of all time.\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Nick Bollinger of RNZ wrote \"David Pine and Matthew Bannister, who wrote the first and second song respectively, were always the chief songwriters in the Sneakies and as these opening tracks show, neither has lost their touch.

It was released 17th April 2020 on Flying Nun Records and the quartet's Bandcamp page. They announced the forthcoming 12 song LP after a rare performance on [[Waitangi Day]] 2020. The Mercury Moment is a \"...potent exploration of extinction, redundancy and disappointed dreams as the four songwriters cast their attention on the current state of the world. Over a songbook of twelve songs, Matthew Bannister, David Pine, Martin Durrant and John Kelcher ruminate on the \u201cludicrous hopes and bleak future\u201d of humanity that is being avoided.

Sasco, which is an acronym for the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, was a [[company town]] with a large [[smelter]] that served several mines. Once an impressive and little-known ghost town, today Sasco is a common sporting destination with shotgun shells, airsoft bb's, paintball splatter, and litter in the area.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\">{{Cite web | title=Experience Arizona: Sasco| work=| url=http://www.experience-az.com/adventures/4wd/sasco/sasco.html| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\">{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|first=James E.|last=Sherman|author2=Barbara H.

Murphy. Murphy believed that by consolidating the various mines, railroad, and processing companies in the [[Silver Bell Mountains]] into one single organization under his control, mining operations would be much more effective and profitable. Murphy's plan was years ahead of its time, because it called for the creation of one large mine that would employ hundreds of workers over a large area, as opposed to most other mines, which were still operated on a small scale, by only a \"handful\" of miners at a time.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\"/>\n\nIn 1903, Murphy and his chief engineer, William Field Staunton, purchased the Union Mine and the Mammoth Mine in the Silver Bell Mountains and combined them to form the Imperial Copper Company and the Silver Bell Mine. One year later, DCA built the Arizona Southern Railroad to connect the Silver Bell Mine with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] at the town of [[Red Rock, Pinal County, Arizona|Red Rock]]. Murphy's next move was to begin work on a large smelter complex and a new town to support it. The resulting Southern Arizona Smelting Company, or Sasco for short, was formed on August 10, 1906. Due to some initial financial problems, work did not begin on the new smelter until the summer of 1907, and it was not completed until February 1908.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"arizona.edu\">{{Cite web | title=Silver Bell Complex, Vignettes in Time Exhibit, BLM| work=| url=http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/blm_vignettes/projects_silverbell.shtml| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>\n\nWhen the smelter was finished, work on the town and efforts to attract settlers were undertaken. Soon the town of Sasco was home to a residential neighborhood of 600 people, as well as a few stores and [[Western saloon|saloon]]s. Mead Goodloe, who oversaw the construction of the smelter, built a large brick home known as \"the big house,\" which became the unofficial [[town center]]. A power house was also built to supply electricity to Sasco, the nearby town of [[Silver Bell, Arizona|Silverbell]], and the Silver Bell Mine. In its heyday, the Sasco smelter employed 175 men and by 1910 had already processed 245,000 tons of copper ore.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\"/><ref name=\"arizona.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Sasco was set to become \"one of the premier smelting towns in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]],\" its existence was very short. Between 1909 and 1911, problems with the DCA mining operations in the [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] area forced Murphy to file for bankruptcy, and the Sasco smelter was closed for the first time. [[Asarco]] took over the Silver Bell Mine in 1915 and reopened the Sasco smelter, which temporarily revived the town, but disaster again struck. During the winter of 1918 and 1919, the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] spread to Sasco and devastated it. Most of the graves in the Sasco Cemetery with plain concrete headstones represent victims of the pandemic.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/>\n\nAsarco closed the Silver Bell Mine in 1921 to focus on operations elsewhere, and in late 1933 most of the buildings in Sasco were demolished, along with the railroad that served the town.

Sasco, which is an acronym for the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, was a [[company town]] with a large [[smelter]] that served several mines. Once an impressive and little-known ghost town, today Sasco is a common sporting destination with shotgun shells, airsoft bb's, paintball splatter, and litter in the area.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\">{{Cite web | title=Experience Arizona: Sasco| work=| url=http://www.experience-az.com/adventures/4wd/sasco/sasco.html| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\">{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|first=James E.|last=Sherman|author2=Barbara H.

Murphy. Murphy believed that by consolidating the various mines, railroad, and processing companies in the [[Silver Bell Mountains]] into one single organization under his control, mining operations would be much more effective and profitable. Murphy's plan was years ahead of its time, because it called for the creation of one large mine that would employ hundreds of workers over a large area, as opposed to most other mines, which were still operated on a small scale, by only a \"handful\" of miners at a time.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\"/>\n\nIn 1903, Murphy and his chief engineer, William Field Staunton, purchased the Union Mine and the Mammoth Mine in the Silver Bell Mountains and combined them to form the Imperial Copper Company and the Silver Bell Mine. One year later, DCA built the Arizona Southern Railroad to connect the Silver Bell Mine with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] at the town of [[Red Rock, Pinal County, Arizona|Red Rock]]. Murphy's next move was to begin work on a large smelter complex and a new town to support it. The resulting Southern Arizona Smelting Company, or Sasco for short, was formed on August 10, 1906. Due to some initial financial problems, work did not begin on the new smelter until the summer of 1907, and it was not completed until February 1908.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"arizona.edu\">{{Cite web | title=Silver Bell Complex, Vignettes in Time Exhibit, BLM| work=| url=http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/blm_vignettes/projects_silverbell.shtml| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>\n\nWhen the smelter was finished, work on the town and efforts to attract settlers were undertaken. Soon the town of Sasco was home to a residential neighborhood of 600 people, as well as a few stores and [[Western saloon|saloon]]s. Mead Goodloe, who oversaw the construction of the smelter, built a large brick home known as \"the big house,\" which became the unofficial [[town center]]. A power house was also built to supply electricity to Sasco, the nearby town of [[Silver Bell, Arizona|Silverbell]], and the Silver Bell Mine. In its heyday, the Sasco smelter employed 175 men and by 1910 had already processed 245,000 tons of copper ore.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\"/><ref name=\"arizona.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Sasco was set to become \"one of the premier smelting towns in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]],\" its existence was very short. Between 1909 and 1911, problems with the DCA mining operations in the [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] area forced Murphy to file for bankruptcy, and the Sasco smelter was closed for the first time. [[Asarco]] took over the Silver Bell Mine in 1915 and reopened the Sasco smelter, which temporarily revived the town, but disaster again struck. During the winter of 1918 and 1919, the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] spread to Sasco and devastated it. Most of the graves in the Sasco Cemetery with plain concrete headstones represent victims of the pandemic.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/>\n\nAsarco closed the Silver Bell Mine in 1921 to focus on operations elsewhere, and in late 1933 most of the buildings in Sasco were demolished, along with the railroad that served the town. The remains of several structures can still be visited today, including the Hotel Rockland, the Sasco Jail, and the smelter complex. According to James E. Sherman, in his book ''Ghost Towns of Arizona'', old broken glass and rusty cans can be found all over the area. The Sasco Cemetery is located northeast of the town site, next to the La Osa Ranch house.<ref name=\"experience-az.com\"/><ref name=\"Sherman, pg. 134\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sasco_Smelter_Arizona_1910.jpg|The smelter complex at Sasco in 1910.\nFile:Hotel_Rockland_Arizona_Before_1921.jpg|The Hotel Rockland sometime before 1921.\nFile:Rockland_Hotel_Sasco_Arizona_2014.jpg|The Hotel Rockland in 2014.\nFile:Sasco_Jail_Arizona_2014.jpg|The Sasco Jail was built of concrete to stop prisoners from escaping.\nFile:Sasco_Smelter_Arizona_2014.jpg|The ruins of the smelter at Sasco. \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona}}\n\n* [[List of ghost towns in Arizona]]\n* [[Twin Buttes, Pima County, Arizona|Twin Buttes, Arizona]]\n* [[Congress Mine]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/az/sasco.html Sasco description and photos]\n\n{{Pinal County, Arizona}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Former populated places in Pinal County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Ghost towns in Arizona]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1907]]\n[[Category:Company towns in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Spanish flu]]\n[[Category:Asarco]]\n", "name_user": "Tillman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGallery:Bigger thumbs in gallery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasco,_Arizona"}

It is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Thanjavur]] and {{convert|273|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]]. Kumbakonam is known as a \"temple city\" due to the prevalence of a number of [[Hindu temple|temples]] here and is noted for its [[Mahamaham festival]] which attracts people from all over the country.\n\nKumbakonam dates back to the [[Sangam period]] and was ruled by the [[Early Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Pandya]]s, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and the [[Thanjavur Marathas]]. It rose to be a prominent town between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, when it served as a capital of the Medieval Cholas. The town reached the zenith of its prosperity during the [[British Raj]] when it was a prominent centre of European education and Hindu culture; and it acquired the cultural name, the \"[[Cambridge]] of [[South India]]\". In 1866, Kumbakonam was officially constituted as a municipality, which today comprises 45 wards, making it the largest municipality and second largest local civil body in Thanjavur district.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Pot's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">{{cite book|page=710|title=The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church, Volume 8|first=Charles George|last=Herbermann|author2=Edward Aloysius Pace |author3=Cond\u00e9 B\u00e9noist Pallen |author4=Thomas Joseph Shahan |author5=John Joseph Wynne |publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia Inc.|year=1934}}</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth.

It is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Thanjavur]] and {{convert|273|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]]. Kumbakonam is known as a \"temple city\" due to the prevalence of a number of [[Hindu temple|temples]] here and is noted for its [[Mahamaham festival]] which attracts people from all over the country.\n\nKumbakonam dates back to the [[Sangam period]] and was ruled by the [[Early Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Pandya]]s, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and the [[Thanjavur Marathas]]. It rose to be a prominent town between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, when it served as a capital of the Medieval Cholas. The town reached the zenith of its prosperity during the [[British Raj]] when it was a prominent centre of European education and Hindu culture; and it acquired the cultural name, the \"[[Cambridge]] of [[South India]]\". In 1866, Kumbakonam was officially constituted as a municipality, which today comprises 45 wards, making it the largest municipality and second largest local civil body in Thanjavur district.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Pot's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">{{cite book|page=710|title=The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church, Volume 8|first=Charles George|last=Herbermann|author2=Edward Aloysius Pace |author3=Cond\u00e9 B\u00e9noist Pallen |author4=Thomas Joseph Shahan |author5=John Joseph Wynne |publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia Inc.|year=1934}}</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth.

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).
