The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit.

After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps.

The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy.

The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years. This was referred to in popular media as a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309230240/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|archive-date=9 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, there was another full \"supermoon\", closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, there was another full \"supermoon\"; this time it was closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}</ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 23:4-7, 33-35.</ref>\n\n===Intercalary months===\n{{main|Intercalary month}}\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.\n\n==== Blue moon====\n{{further|Blue moon}}\nIn the modern system of \"traditional\" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well-known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124181408/https://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon/ |date=2018-01-24 }}.</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the Sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1:48 am on 23 March, 9:15 am on 22 June, 4:42 pm on 21 September and 12:10 am on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4:39 am on 21 March, 11:09 pm on 21 June, 2:42 pm on 23 September and 10:30 am on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |title=''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\" |access-date=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327035511/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |archive-date=2014-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young - Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n", "name_user": "24.117.233.229", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon"}

It was first released on August 28, 2009 through [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] in Europe, then August 31, 2009 with [[Arista Records]] in the United States before being released by [[RCA Records]] in the United Kingdom on October 19, 2009. The album was Houston's first studio album since 2002's ''[[Just Whitney]]''.\n\nIt received favorable reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 66/100 from [[Metacritic]] and debuted on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one with sales of 305,000, beating her previous career best first-week sale of 205,137 units with ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002), and it was her first album to reach number one in the US since 1992's ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]''. Additionally it became her fourth chart-topping album, thus extending her as the female artist with the most cumulative weeks at the number one position.\n\nIt has spawned two official singles: The [[I Look to You (song)|title song]], which became a top 20 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&B chart]] single, and the international single \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\", which hit the top ten in several countries worldwide and also becoming a US top 20 R&B hit. Since its release, ''I Look to You'' has gone on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide, earning platinum [[Music recording sales certification|certification]] in seven countries and gold certification in eight. A promotional single, \"Nothin' But Love\", taken from the album, was only released to UK radio stations to promote the accompanying [[Nothing but Love World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n''I Look to You'' had first been conceived in 2007 with recording and production taking place in 2008, as said Houston during her Los Angeles album listening party in 2009.<ref name=laparty/> Rumor of Houston's return to music were first circulated at the start of 2007 and were then substantiated when record label boss and close mentor [[Clive Davis]] confirmed that he would personally be involved in the project whilst speaking on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In February 2009, Houston appeared on stage at Davis's \"Pre-Grammy Gala\" where she performed a four-song set comprising \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\", \"[[I Believe in You and Me]]\", \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\", and a rousing version of \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Onlookers included her mother [[Cissy Houston]], musicians [[Paul McCartney]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Barry Manilow]] as well as actors [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=pregrammy>{{cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b99016_whitney_houston_we_dont_have_problem.html |title=Whitney Houston we don't have a problem |work=[[E!Online|E!

It was first released on August 28, 2009 through [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] in Europe, then August 31, 2009 with [[Arista Records]] in the United States before being released by [[RCA Records]] in the United Kingdom on October 19, 2009. The album was Houston's first studio album since 2002's ''[[Just Whitney]]''.\n\nIt received favorable reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 66/100 from [[Metacritic]] and debuted on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one with sales of 305,000, beating her previous career best first-week sale of 205,137 units with ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002), and it was her first album to reach number one in the US since 1992's ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]''. Additionally it became her fourth chart-topping album, thus extending her as the female artist with the most cumulative weeks at the number one position.\n\nIt has spawned two official singles: The [[I Look to You (song)|title song]], which became a top 20 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&B chart]] single, and the international single \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\", which hit the top ten in several countries worldwide and also becoming a US top 20 R&B hit. Since its release, ''I Look to You'' has gone on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide, earning platinum [[Music recording sales certification|certification]] in seven countries and gold certification in eight. A promotional single, \"Nothin' But Love\", taken from the album, was only released to UK radio stations to promote the accompanying [[Nothing but Love World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n''I Look to You'' had first been conceived in 2007 with recording and production taking place in 2008, as said Houston during her Los Angeles album listening party in 2009.<ref name=laparty/> Rumor of Houston's return to music were first circulated at the start of 2007 and were then substantiated when record label boss and close mentor [[Clive Davis]] confirmed that he would personally be involved in the project whilst speaking on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In February 2009, Houston appeared on stage at Davis's \"Pre-Grammy Gala\" where she performed a four-song set comprising \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\", \"[[I Believe in You and Me]]\", \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\", and a rousing version of \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Onlookers included her mother [[Cissy Houston]], musicians [[Paul McCartney]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Barry Manilow]] as well as actors [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=pregrammy>{{cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b99016_whitney_houston_we_dont_have_problem.html |title=Whitney Houston we don't have a problem |work=[[E!Online|E!

She said \"That makes it real. The changes that we go through, the transitions that we go through, the tests that we go through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, but for the most part, I kept my faith and I kept my head up... I took my time.

If a little too steady to be called a classic, ''I Look To You'' is certainly an accomplished, enjoyable return\u2014don't call it a comeback\u2014from an artist who sounds keen again, a lioness who's rediscovered her pride.\"<ref name=\"digitalspy review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a174768/whitney-houston-i-look-to-you.html |title=Music \u2013 Album Review \u2013 Whitney Houston: 'I Look To You' |work=Digital Spy |publisher=Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias |date=September 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''I Look to You'' debuted at number one on the US ''Billboard'' 200 with sales of 305,000 copies<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/arts/music/10arts-WHITNEYHOUST_BRF.html Whitney Houston Is Back at No. 1] ''NYTimes''.
