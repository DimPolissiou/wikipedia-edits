It was created out of the Slovak part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] one day before the start of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]]. The Slovak Republic controlled the majority of the territory of present-day [[Slovakia]] but without its current southern and eastern parts, which had been forcibly ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] in 1938. The Republic bordered Germany and constituent parts of \"[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]\": the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[General Government]] (the German-occupied remnant of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]) \u2013 along with independent Hungary.\n\nGermany recognized the Slovak State, as did several other states, including [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Estonia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Manchukuo]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Vatican City]]. The majority of the [[Allies of World War II]] never recognized the existence of the Slovak Republic. The Soviet Union [[Czech Republic\u2013Russia relations#History|nullified its recognition]] after Slovakia joined [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the USSR in 1941]].\n\n==Name==\nThe official name of the country was the Slovak State (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00fd \u0161t\u00e1t'') from 14 March to 21 July 1939 (until the adoption of the [[Constitution of Slovakia (1939)|Constitution]]), and the Slovak Republic (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') from 21 July 1939 to its end in April 1945. The country is often referred to historically as the ''First Slovak Republic'' (Slovak: ''prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') to distinguish it from the contemporary (Second) [[Slovak Republic]], Slovakia, which is not considered its legal [[Succession of states|successor state]].

As the Nazi F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory and creation of his [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], he had various plans for Slovakia. German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state under the influence of Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and other regions.\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Hitler invited [[Monsignor]] [[Jozef Tiso]] (the Slovak ex-[[prime minister]] who had been deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier) to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament (\"Diet of the Slovak Land\") which would approve Slovakia's independence.\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons due to the fact that some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian minority]].<ref name=\"RadioPrague\">{{cite web |author=Dominik J\u016fn interviewing Professor Jan Rychl\u00edk |title=Czechs and Slovaks - more than just neighbours |publisher=Radio Prague |year=2016 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/czechs-and-slovaks-more-than-just-neighbours |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> The debate was quickly brought to a head when [[Franz Karmasin]], leader of the [[Germans in Slovakia|German minority]] in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history.<ref name=\"RadioPrague\"/> Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state.

With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile [[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|combat group]] consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of [[combat engineer]]s, all commanded by Anton\u00edn Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Mal\u00e1r. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (Slovak Republic)|1st]] and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Dukla Pass|Dukla Mountain Passes]], advancing towards [[D\u0119bica]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]] in the region of southern Poland.\n\n===Slovak forces during the campaign against the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender.png|thumb|Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender]]\nThe Slovak military participated in the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet Union. The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].<ref name=Felgrau>{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/a-slovakia.html |title=Slovak Axis Forces in WWII |author=Jason Pipes |work=Feldgrau |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]]. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the [[Kuban bridgehead]], then being badly mangled near [[Melitopol]] in southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason.<ref name=Felgrau/>\n\n===Slovak National Uprising===\n{{Main|Slovak National Uprising}}\n[[File:Karte Slowakischer Nationalaufstand 1944 - Aufstandsbeginn.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Situation map in first days of Slovak National Uprising]]\nIn the 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]], many Slovak units sided with the Slovak resistance and rebelled against Tiso's collaborationist government, while others helped German forces put the uprising down.\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:Ante Paveli\u0107, Karl Murga\u0161 and Mladen Lorkovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|Slovak Ambassador to [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], Karel Murga\u0161 (in the middle) with Croatian ''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning, the Slovak Republic was under the influence of Germany.

Minorities included Germans (4.8 percent), Czechs (2.9 percent), [[Rusyns]] (2.6 percent), Hungarians (2.1 percent), Jews (1.1 percent), and [[Romani people]] (0.9 percent).{{sfn|Kamenec|2011a|p=175}} Seventy-five percent of Slovaks were Catholics, and most of the remainder belonged to the [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia|Lutheran]] and [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] churches.{{sfn|Rothkirchen|2001|p=596}} 50% of the population were employed in agriculture. The state was divided in six counties (''[[\u017eupa|\u017eupy]]''), 58 districts (''[[okres]]y'') and 2659 municipalities. The capital Bratislava had over 140,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe state continued the legal system of Czechoslovakia, which was modified only gradually. According to the Constitution of 1939, the \"President\" (Jozef Tiso) was the head of the state, the \"Assembly/Diet of the Slovak Republic\" elected for five years was the highest legislative body (no general elections took place, however), and the \"State Council\" performed the duties of a senate. The government with eight ministries was the executive body.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was an authoritarian state where the German pressure resulted in the adoption of many elements of German [[Nazism]]. Some historians characterized the Slovak regime from 1939 to 1945 as [[Clerical Fascism|clerical fascism]]. The government issued a number of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws, prohibiting the [[Jews]] from participation in public life, and later supported their deportation to [[concentration camp]]s erected by Germany on Polish territory. The only political parties permitted were the dominant [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] and two smaller openly fascist parties, these being the [[Hungarian National Party (Czechoslovakia)|Hungarian National Party]] which represented the Hungarian minority and the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] which represented the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Slovak Republic 1939 45 Administrative Map.png|thumb|right|The Slovak Republic in 1944]]\nThe Slovak Republic was divided into 6 counties and 58 districts as of 1 January 1940.

The Hlinka's Guard began to attack Jews, and the \"[[Anti-Jewish laws#Slovakia|Jewish Code]]\" was passed in September 1941. Resembling the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the code required Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow armband]], and banned them from intermarriage and from many jobs. By October 1941, 15,000 Jews were expelled from Bratislava; many were sent to labour camps.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was one of the countries to agree to deport its Jews as part of the Nazi [[Final Solution]]. Originally, the Slovak government tried to make a deal with Germany in October 1941 to deport its Jews as a substitute for providing Slovak workers to help the war effort. After the [[Wannsee Conference]], the Germans agreed to the Slovak proposal, and a deal was reached where the Slovak Republic would pay for each Jew deported, and, in return, Germany promised that the Jews would never return to the republic. The initial terms were for \"20,000 young, strong Jews\", but the Slovak government quickly agreed to a German proposal to deport the entire population for \"evacuation to territories in the East\" meaning to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref name=\"HEART\">{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/slovakjews.html |publisher=Holocaust Research Project.org |title=The Fate of the Slovak Jews |authors=Branik Ceslav & Carmelo Lisciotto,  H.E.A.R.T |year=2008 |at=Sources: G.

By then, however, some 58,000 Jews had already been deported, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Slovak government officials filed complaints against Germany, when it became clear that many of the previously deported Slovak Jews had been gassed in mass executions.<ref name=\"HEART\"/>\n\nJewish deportations resumed on 30 September 1944, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army reached the Slovak border, and the [[Slovak National Uprising]] took place. As a result of these events, Germany decided to occupy all of Slovakia and the country lost its independence. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported and 5,000 were imprisoned. Deportations continued until 31 March 1945. In all, German and Slovak authorities deported about 70,000 Jews from Slovakia; about 65,000 of them were murdered or died in concentration camps.

The German troops were gradually pushed out by the [[Red Army]], by [[Romania]]n and by Czechoslovak troops coming from the east. The liberated territories became ''[[de facto]]'' part of Czechoslovakia again.\n\nThe First Slovak Republic ceased to exist ''de facto'' on 4 April 1945 when the Red Army captured Bratislava and occupied all of Slovakia. ''[[De jure]]'' it ceased to exist when the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General [[Walton Walker]] leading the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] of the [[3rd US Army]] on 8 May 1945 in the [[Austria]]n town of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]]. In summer 1945, the captured former president and members of former government were handed over to Czechoslovak authorities.\n\nSeveral prominent Slovak politicians escaped to [[neutral countries]]. Following his captivity, the deposed president Jozef Tiso authorized the former foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] as his successor. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, Tiso's personal secretary Karol Mur\u00edn, and cousin Fra\u0148o Tiso were appointed by ex-president Tiso as the representatives of the Slovak nation, however they failed to create a [[government-in-exile]] as no country recognized them. In the 1950s with fellow Slovak nationalist they established Slovak Action Committee (later Slovak Liberation Committee) which unsuccessfully advocated the restoration of the independent Slovak State and the renewal of war against the Soviet Union. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] and the creation of the [[Slovakia|Slovak republic]], the Slovak Liberation Committee proclaimed Tiso's authorization as obsolete.\n\n[[File:50 Slovak Koruna 1944 front Josef Tiso.png|thumb|50 Slovak koruna silver coin on the occasion of the five-year anniversary of Slovak Republic (1939\u20131944) with an effigy of the Slovak president [[Jozef Tiso]]]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Slovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] (1919)\n* [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945)\n* [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (1939\u20131945)\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Slovensk\u00e9 vzdu\u0161n\u00e9 zbrane]] \u2013 World War II Slovak Air Force\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u20131989)]]\n* [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1960\u20131989)\n* [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] (1969\u20131990)\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1989\u20131992)]]\n* [[Czech Republic]] (1993\u2013present)\n* [[Slovakia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n*{{cite book |last1=De\u00e1k |first1=Istv\u00e1n |authorlink1=Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k |title=Europe on Trial: The Story of Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution during World War II |date=2015 |orig-year=2013|publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-8133-4790-5 |ref=harv |language=en}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Hutzelmann |first1=Barbara |editor1-last=Bajohr |editor1-first=Frank |editor2-last=L\u00f6w |editor2-first=Andrea |title=The Holocaust and European Societies: Social Processes and Social Dynamics |date=2016|location=London |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-56984-4 |pages=167\u2013185 |language=en |chapter=Slovak Society and the Jews: Attitudes and Patterns of Behaviour |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamenec |first1=Ivan|chapter=The Slovak state, 1939\u20131945 |editor1-last=Teich |editor1-first=Mikul\u00e1\u0161 |editor2-last=Kov\u00e1\u010d |editor2-first=Du\u0161an |editor3-last=Brown |editor3-first=Martin D. |title=Slovakia in History |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-49494-6|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511780141|ref={{sfnref|Kamenec|2011a}}|pp=175\u2013192}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|First Slovak Republic}}\n* [http://www.upn.gov.sk/obdobie-1939-1945/dokumenty-1939-1945/ Selected laws of the First Slovak Republic, including the constitution (in Slovak)]\n* [http://stanislav.blog.pravda.sk/2011/06/13/international-situation-impetus-as-a-former-of-intrastate-political-structure-a-comparison-of-the-first-and-second-slovak-republics%E2%80%99-political-systems/ A Comparison of the First and Second Slovak Republics\u2019 Political Systems]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{World War II}}\n{{Czechoslovakia in World War Two}}\n{{Munich Agreement}}\n{{Czechoslovakia timeline}}\n{{Slovakia topics}}\n{{Holocaust Slovakia}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|48|08|N|17|06|E|type:country_source:kolossus-eswiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slovak Republic (1939-1945)}}\n[[Category:Client states of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Slovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Slovak National Uprising]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:Former Slavic countries]]\n[[Category:1939 in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:1940s in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Military history of Czechoslovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:20th century in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Political history of Czechoslovakia|.1939]]\n[[Category:Axis powers]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Slovak State|the modern Slovak state|Slovakia}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}{{Infobox country\n|native_name = ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika''\n|conventional_long_name = Slovak Republic\n|common_name = Slovakia\n|status = [[Client state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]{{efn|Views differ on Slovakia's relation to Germany.

It was created out of the Slovak part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] one day before the start of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]]. The Slovak Republic controlled the majority of the territory of present-day [[Slovakia]] but without its current southern and eastern parts, which had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] in 1938. The Republic bordered Germany and constituent parts of \"[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]\": the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[General Government]] (the German-occupied remnant of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]) \u2013 along with independent Hungary.\n\nGermany recognized the Slovak State, as did several other states, including [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Estonia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Manchukuo]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Vatican City]]. The majority of the [[Allies of World War II]] never recognized the existence of the Slovak Republic. The Soviet Union [[Czech Republic\u2013Russia relations#History|nullified its recognition]] after Slovakia joined [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the USSR in 1941]].\n\n==Name==\nThe official name of the country was the Slovak State (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00fd \u0161t\u00e1t'') from 14 March to 21 July 1939 (until the adoption of the [[Constitution of Slovakia (1939)|Constitution]]), and the Slovak Republic (Slovak: ''Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') from 21 July 1939 to its end in April 1945. The country is often referred to historically as the ''First Slovak Republic'' (Slovak: ''prv\u00e1 Slovensk\u00e1 republika'') to distinguish it from the contemporary (Second) [[Slovak Republic]], Slovakia, which is not considered its legal [[Succession of states|successor state]].

As the Nazi F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory and creation of his [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], he had various plans for Slovakia. German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state under the influence of Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and other regions.\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Hitler invited [[Monsignor]] [[Jozef Tiso]] (the Slovak ex-[[prime minister]] who had been deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier) to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament (\"Diet of the Slovak Land\") which would approve Slovakia's independence.\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons due to the fact that some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian minority]].<ref name=\"RadioPrague\">{{cite web |author=Dominik J\u016fn interviewing Professor Jan Rychl\u00edk |title=Czechs and Slovaks - more than just neighbours |publisher=Radio Prague |year=2016 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/czechs-and-slovaks-more-than-just-neighbours |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> The debate was quickly brought to a head when [[Franz Karmasin]], leader of the [[Germans in Slovakia|German minority]] in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history.<ref name=\"RadioPrague\"/> Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic.

With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile [[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|combat group]] consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of [[combat engineer]]s, all commanded by Anton\u00edn Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Mal\u00e1r. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the [[1st Infantry Division (Slovak Republic)|1st]] and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Dukla Pass|Dukla Mountain Passes]], advancing towards [[D\u0119bica]] and [[Tarn\u00f3w]] in the region of southern Poland.\n\n===Slovak forces during the campaign against the Soviet Union===\n[[File:Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender.png|thumb|Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender]]\nThe Slovak military participated in the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet Union. The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].<ref name=Felgrau>{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/a-slovakia.html |title=Slovak Axis Forces in WWII |author=Jason Pipes |work=Feldgrau |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]]. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the [[Kuban bridgehead]], then being badly mangled near [[Melitopol]] in southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason.<ref name=Felgrau/>\n\n===Slovak National Uprising===\n{{Main|Slovak National Uprising}}\n[[File:Karte Slowakischer Nationalaufstand 1944 - Aufstandsbeginn.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Situation map in first days of Slovak National Uprising]]\nIn the 1944 [[Slovak National Uprising]], many Slovak units sided with the Slovak resistance and rebelled against Tiso's collaborationist government, while others helped German forces put the uprising down.\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:Ante Paveli\u0107, Karl Murga\u0161 and Mladen Lorkovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|Slovak Ambassador to [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], Karel Murga\u0161 (in the middle) with Croatian ''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning, the Slovak Republic was under the influence of Germany.

The government with eight ministries was the executive body.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was an authoritarian state where the German pressure resulted in the adoption of many elements of German [[Nazism]]. Some historians characterized the Slovak regime from 1939 to 1945 as [[Clerical Fascism|clerical fascism]]. The government issued a number of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws, prohibiting the [[Jews]] from participation in public life, and later supported their deportation to [[concentration camp]]s erected by Germany on Polish territory. The only political parties permitted were the dominant [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] and two smaller openly fascist parties, these being the [[Hungarian National Party (Czechoslovakia)|Hungarian National Party]] which represented the Hungarian minority and the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] which represented the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Slovak Republic 1939 45 Administrative Map.png|thumb|right|The Slovak Republic in 1944]]\nThe Slovak Republic was divided into 6 counties and 58 districts as of 1 January 1940. The extant population records are from the same time:\n# Bratislava county (''Bratislavsk\u00e1 \u017eupa''), 3,667&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 455,728 inhabitants, and 6 districts: [[Bratislava]], [[Malacky]], [[Modra]], [[Senica]], [[Skalica]], and [[Trnava]].\n# Nitra county (''Nitrianska \u017eupa''), 3,546&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 335,343 inhabitants, and 5 districts: [[Hlohovec]], [[Nitra]], [[Prievidza]], [[Topo\u013e\u010dany]], and [[Zlat\u00e9 Moravce]].\n# Tren\u010d\u00edn county (''Tren\u010dianska \u017eupa''), 5,592&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 516,698 inhabitants, and 12 districts: [[B\u00e1novce nad Bebravou]], [[\u010cadca]], [[Ilava]], [[Kysuck\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto]], [[Myjava]], [[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom]], [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]], [[Pova\u017esk\u00e1 Bystrica]], [[P\u00fachov]], [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]], [[Byt\u010da|Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Byt\u010da]], and [[\u017dilina]].\n# Tatra county (''Tatransk\u00e1 \u017eupa''), 9,222&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 463,286 inhabitants, and 13 districts: [[Doln\u00fd Kub\u00edn]], [[Gelnica]], [[Ke\u017emarok]], [[Levo\u010da]], [[Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161|Liptovsk\u00fd Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161]], [[N\u00e1mestovo]], [[Poprad]], [[Ru\u017eomberok]], [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves]], [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Star\u00e1 Ves]], [[Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a]], [[Trsten\u00e1]], and [[Martin, Slovakia|Tur\u010diansky Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Martin]].\n# \u0160ari\u0161-Zempl\u00edn county (''\u0160ari\u0161sko-zempl\u00ednska \u017eupa''), 7,390&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 440,372 inhabitants, and 10 districts: [[Bardejov]], [[Giraltovce]], [[Humenn\u00e9]], [[Medzilaborce]], [[Michalovce]], [[Pre\u0161ov]], [[Sabinov]], [[Stropkov]], [[Trebi\u0161ov]], and [[Vranov nad Top\u013eou]].\n# Hron county (''Pohronsk\u00e1 \u017eupa''), 8,587&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 443,626 inhabitants, and 12 districts: [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]], [[Brezno|Brezno nad Hronom]], [[Dob\u0161in\u00e1]], [[Hn\u00fa\u0161\u0165a]], [[Kremnica]], [[Krupina]], [[Lovinoba\u0148a]], [[Modr\u00fd Kame\u0148]], [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], [[Rev\u00faca]], and [[Zvolen]].\n\n==The Holocaust==\n{{Further|The Holocaust in Slovakia}}\n\n[[File:\"Nebu\u010f slu\u017eobn\u00edkom \u017eida\"\u2014Slovak propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Man kissing feet of another man with hooked nose, dropping money on his head|A Slovak propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=1.2]]\nSoon after independence and along with the mass exile and deportation of Czechs, the Slovak Republic began a series of measures aimed against the Jews in the country. The Hlinka's Guard began to attack Jews, and the \"[[Anti-Jewish laws#Slovakia|Jewish Code]]\" was passed in September 1941. Resembling the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the code required Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow armband]], and banned them from intermarriage and from many jobs. By October 1941, 15,000 Jews were expelled from Bratislava; many were sent to labour camps.\n\nThe Slovak Republic was one of the countries to agree to deport its Jews as part of the Nazi [[Final Solution]]. Originally, the Slovak government tried to make a deal with Germany in October 1941 to deport its Jews as a substitute for providing Slovak workers to help the war effort. After the [[Wannsee Conference]], the Germans agreed to the Slovak proposal, and a deal was reached where the Slovak Republic would pay for each Jew deported, and, in return, Germany promised that the Jews would never return to the republic. The initial terms were for \"20,000 young, strong Jews\", but the Slovak government quickly agreed to a German proposal to deport the entire population for \"evacuation to territories in the East\" meaning to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].<ref name=\"HEART\">{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/slovakjews.html |publisher=Holocaust Research Project.org |title=The Fate of the Slovak Jews |authors=Branik Ceslav & Carmelo Lisciotto,  H.E.A.R.T |year=2008 |at=Sources: G.

By then, however, some 58,000 Jews had already been deported, mostly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Slovak government officials filed complaints against Germany, when it became clear that many of the previously deported Slovak Jews had been gassed in mass executions.<ref name=\"HEART\"/>\n\nJewish deportations resumed on 30 September 1944, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army reached the Slovak border, and the [[Slovak National Uprising]] took place. As a result of these events, Germany decided to occupy all of Slovakia and the country lost its independence. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported and 5,000 were imprisoned. Deportations continued until 31 March 1945. In all, German and Slovak authorities deported about 70,000 Jews from Slovakia; about 65,000 of them were murdered or died in concentration camps. The overall figures are inexact, partly because many Jews did not identify themselves, but one 2006 estimate is that approximately 105,000 Slovak Jews, or 77% of their pre-war population, died during the war.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rebekah Klein-Pej\u0161ov\u00e1|title=An overview of the history of Jews in Slovakia|work=Slovak Jewish Heritage|publisher=Synagoga Slovaca|year=2006|url=http://www.slovak-jewish-heritage.org/history-of-jews-in-slovakia.php|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==SS plans for Slovakia==\nAlthough the official policy of the Nazi regime was in favour of an independent Slovak state dependent on Germany and opposed to any annexations of Slovak territory, [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s [[SS]] considered ambitious population policy options concerning the [[Carpathian Germans|German minority of Slovakia]], which numbered circa 130,000 people.<ref name=\"Longerich\">Longerich, P.

The German troops were gradually pushed out by the [[Red Army]], by [[Romania]]n and by Czechoslovak troops coming from the east. The liberated territories became ''[[de facto]]'' part of Czechoslovakia again.\n\nThe First Slovak Republic ceased to exist ''de facto'' on 4 April 1945 when the Red Army captured Bratislava and occupied all of Slovakia. ''[[De jure]]'' it ceased to exist when the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General [[Walton Walker]] leading the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] of the [[3rd US Army]] on 8 May 1945 in the [[Austria]]n town of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]]. In summer 1945, the captured former president and members of former government were handed over to Czechoslovak authorities.\n\nSeveral prominent Slovak politicians escaped to [[neutral countries]]. Following his captivity, the deposed president Jozef Tiso authorized the former foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] as his successor. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, Tiso's personal secretary Karol Mur\u00edn, and cousin Fra\u0148o Tiso were appointed by ex-president Tiso as the representatives of the Slovak nation, however they failed to create a [[government-in-exile]] as no country recognized them. In the 1950s with fellow Slovak nationalist they established Slovak Action Committee (later Slovak Liberation Committee) which unsuccessfully advocated the restoration of the independent Slovak State and the renewal of war against the Soviet Union. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] and the creation of the [[Slovakia|Slovak republic]], the Slovak Liberation Committee proclaimed Tiso's authorization as obsolete.\n\n[[File:50 Slovak Koruna 1944 front Josef Tiso.png|thumb|50 Slovak koruna silver coin on the occasion of the five-year anniversary of Slovak Republic (1939\u20131944) with an effigy of the Slovak president [[Jozef Tiso]]]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Slovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] (1919)\n* [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938\u20131945)\n* [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (1939\u20131945)\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Slovensk\u00e9 vzdu\u0161n\u00e9 zbrane]] \u2013 World War II Slovak Air Force\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)]]\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u20131989)]]\n* [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1960\u20131989)\n* [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] (1969\u20131990)\n* [[History of Czechoslovakia (1989\u20131992)]]\n* [[Czech Republic]] (1993\u2013present)\n* [[Slovakia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Sources\n*{{cite book |last1=De\u00e1k |first1=Istv\u00e1n |authorlink1=Istv\u00e1n De\u00e1k |title=Europe on Trial: The Story of Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution during World War II |date=2015 |orig-year=2013|publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-8133-4790-5 |ref=harv |language=en}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Hutzelmann |first1=Barbara |editor1-last=Bajohr |editor1-first=Frank |editor2-last=L\u00f6w |editor2-first=Andrea |title=The Holocaust and European Societies: Social Processes and Social Dynamics |date=2016|location=London |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-56984-4 |pages=167\u2013185 |language=en |chapter=Slovak Society and the Jews: Attitudes and Patterns of Behaviour |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Kamenec |first1=Ivan|chapter=The Slovak state, 1939\u20131945 |editor1-last=Teich |editor1-first=Mikul\u00e1\u0161 |editor2-last=Kov\u00e1\u010d |editor2-first=Du\u0161an |editor3-last=Brown |editor3-first=Martin D. |title=Slovakia in History |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-49494-6|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511780141|ref={{sfnref|Kamenec|2011a}}|pp=175\u2013192}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|First Slovak Republic}}\n* [http://www.upn.gov.sk/obdobie-1939-1945/dokumenty-1939-1945/ Selected laws of the First Slovak Republic, including the constitution (in Slovak)]\n* [http://stanislav.blog.pravda.sk/2011/06/13/international-situation-impetus-as-a-former-of-intrastate-political-structure-a-comparison-of-the-first-and-second-slovak-republics%E2%80%99-political-systems/ A Comparison of the First and Second Slovak Republics\u2019 Political Systems]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{World War II}}\n{{Czechoslovakia in World War Two}}\n{{Munich Agreement}}\n{{Czechoslovakia timeline}}\n{{Slovakia topics}}\n{{Holocaust Slovakia}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|48|08|N|17|06|E|type:country_source:kolossus-eswiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slovak Republic (1939-1945)}}\n[[Category:Client states of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Slovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Slovak National Uprising]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Former republics]]\n[[Category:Former Slavic countries]]\n[[Category:1939 in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:1940s in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Military history of Czechoslovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia|.]]\n[[Category:20th century in Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Political history of Czechoslovakia|.1939]]\n[[Category:Axis powers]]\n", "name_user": "EMoore01", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Republic_(1939%E2%80%931945)"}
{"title_page": "Scoring (cricket)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:This is scoring.OGG|right|thumb|300px|How runs are scored and teams win a match]]\n'''Scoring''' in [[cricket]] matches involves two elements \u2013 the number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the number of [[wicket (cricket)|wickets]] lost by each team. The '''scorer''' is someone appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s bowled. In professional games, in compliance with the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', two scorers are appointed, most often one provided by each team.\n\nThe scorers have no say in whether runs or extras are scored, wickets taken or overs bowled.  This is the job of the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]]s on the field of play, who signal to the scorers in cases of ambiguity such as when runs are to be given as extras rather than credited to the batsmen, or when the batsman is to be awarded a boundary 4 or 6. So that the umpire knows that they have seen each signal, the scorers are required to immediately acknowledge it.\n\nWhile it is possible to keep score using a pencil and plain paper, scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles.  Simple score books allow the recording of each [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman's]] runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowlers']] analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket.  More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman.  Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers.  It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored.  Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.\n\nIn early times runs scored were sometimes simply recorded by carving notches on a stick{{snd}}this root of the use of the slang term \"notches\" for \"runs\".  In contrast, scoring in the modern game has become a specialism, particularly for international and national cricket competitions.  While the scorers' role is clearly defined under the ''Laws of Cricket'' to be merely the recording of runs, wickets and overs, and the constant checking of the accuracy of their records with each other and with the umpires, in practice a modern scorer's role is complicated by other requirements. For instance, cricket authorities often require information about matters such as the rate at which teams bowled their overs. The media also ask to be notified of records, statistics and averages. For many important matches, unofficial scorers keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists allowing the official scorers to concentrate undisturbed.  In the English county game, the scorers also keep score on a computer that updates a central server, to meet the demands of the online press that scores should be as up-to-date as possible.\n\nThe official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these may be corrected after the event.\n\nSome cricket statisticians who keep score unofficially for the printed and broadcast media have become quite famous, for instance [[Bill Frindall]], who scored for the [[BBC]] radio commentary team from 1966 to 2008, and [[Jo King]].\n\nThe [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s [[Association of Cricket Officials]] provides training for scorers.<ref>[https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/78963 ECB ACO] Education \u2013 scorer courses (\"Scorers Count\")</ref>\n\n==Methods of scoring==\n[[Image:Cricketscoredcard1b.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a scorecard]]\nThere are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerised.\n\nThe manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.\n\nMost software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.\n\nIn addition to PC software, mobile apps are being used. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. There are several cricket scoring apps<ref>[https://medium.com/cricheroes/6-live-scoring-apps-for-your-local-cricket-match-799df9d7b83f  Cricket Scoring Apps For Your Local Cricket Match]</ref> such as Total Cricket Scorer (TCS), a  comprehensive program favoured many scorers in the County Championship{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}} in England, CricHQ, CricHeroes, CricScores, CricksLab, CricClubs, Chauka etc.. TCS was bought out by CricHQ in late 2015.  Mobile apps allow amateur cricketers to keep their scores online, and also provide them with personalised statistics and graphs on their own mobile devices.\n\nThe ECB make free software available for cricket scoring both on PC and mobile devices from the PlayCricket website.\n\n==Referring to scores==\n[[File:Adelaide Scoreboard1206.jpg|thumb|right|The [[scoreboard]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]].]]\nThe score of a [[cricket]] team whose [[innings]] is in progress is given as the number of [[run (cricket)|run]]s they have scored \"''for''\" the number of [[wicket]]s their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of \"''one hundred for three''\", written 100\u20133 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100\u20133 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3\u2013100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of \"''three hundred all out''\", rather than \"''three hundred for ten''\"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team [[Declaration and forfeiture|declare]] their innings closed (in a [[First-class cricket|First-class]] match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275\u20137. A declaration is noted by appending a \"d\" or \"dec\" to the score (for example 300\u20138d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word \"declared\" appended (example: \"''300 for 8, declared''\").\n\nIn a two-innings match, the scores of each team for their two innings are always given separately rather than being totalled, and the current score is stated in terms of how many runs the batting team lead or trail by. An example of a score for a two-innings match in progress would be: Team A 240 & 300\u20137d, Team B 225 & 130\u20134. This indicates that Team A in their first innings scored 240 runs, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed, and Team B are currently 130 for 4 \u2013 in this scenario, Team B currently trail by 185 runs (and are said to be facing a ''target'' or ''run chase'' of 316, the score with which they would win the match). If a team has [[follow-on|followed on]] in its second innings, this is indicated by appending \"(f/o)\" to their score, e.g. Team A 513, Team B 145 & 254\u20137 (f/o).\n\nWhen a game is completed, there are standard ways of referring to the difference in scores between the two teams. For instance, if Team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136, then Team B, batting second, only scored 185, whether or not they go all out, it would be said that \"''Team A won by 69 runs''\" because they either bowled out the opposition or caused them to exhaust their overs (in a limited-overs match) when they were trailing by 69 runs. On the other hand, if team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136 but team B, batting second, scored 255\u20138, it would be said that \"''team B won by 2 wickets''\" because they reached their target with 2 wickets remaining. In a two-innings match, a team can win having only batted once (while the other team, batting twice, has not equalled the other team's score). For instance, team A score 160 all out, team B score 530 and declare, then team A score 230 all out. In this case it would be said that \"''team B won by an innings and 140 runs''\".\n\n==Winning scores==\nIn [[Limited overs cricket|limited over matches]] (one innings matches), the team that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs with the loss of 1 wicket (250\u20131), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251\u20139), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar situation if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.\n\nIn limited overs matches shortened by bad weather, the winning team is the one whose scoring is best according to the targets set by a rain rule, usually the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]. The method used to set targets takes into account both the number of overs and the number of wickets lost.\n\nIn [[First-class cricket]] (two innings match), the team that scores more runs, having dismissed its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not much time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316\u20139, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.\n\nThe terms ''draw'' and ''tie'', which are synonymous in many sports, have distinct meanings in cricket. A tie refers to a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but rather is said to have ''no result''.\nHowever, in the case of a tournament final, the match may be decided by an extra over, or awarded to the team with the most boundaries scored, or least wickets lost, or another method indicated by the rules of the tournament. This was the case in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, awarded to England on most boundaries scored after a tie and an extra over (super over), after scores remained level.\n\n==Detailed scoring==\n{{see also|Scoring runs in cricket}}\nCricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:\n*For each ball, who bowled it and how many runs were scored from it, whether by the batsman with his bat ('off the bat') or [[byes]].\n*For each batsman, every scoring run made.\n*For each [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]], the kind of dismissal (e.g. [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] or [[run out]]), the bowler (in the case of a bowling, LBW, catch, wicket hit, or stumping), any other player involved (in the case of a catch, run out, or stumping), as well as the total the batting team reached at that point in the game ('the fall of wicket'). Example notations as seen on cricket scorecards:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latestcricketscore.com/|title=Latest Cricket Score |work=Latest Cricket Score| date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n:*''c ''fielder'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Caught]]\n:*''c & b ''bowler \u2013 Caught & bowled (the bowler was also the catching fielder)\n:*''b ''bowler \u2013 [[Bowled]]\n:*''lbw b ''bowler \u2013 [[Leg before wicket]]\n:*''st ''wicket-keeper'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Stumped]]\n:*''hit wicket'' ''b'' bowler - [[Hit wicket]]\n*For each bowler (his 'figures'), the number of overs bowled, the number of wickets taken, the number of runs conceded, and the number of [[maiden over]]s bowled.\n\nTraditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball.  Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by [[John Atkinson Pendlington]], [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] and [[Bill Frindall]], to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler.  Another early method of recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler was devised by Australian scorer [[Johann Gottlieb Jackschon|J.G. Jackschon]] in the 1890s, using a separate memorandum alongside the main scoresheet.\n\nFrequently more detail is recorded, for instance, for a batsman, the number of balls faced and the number of minutes batted. Sometimes charts (known as '''wagon wheels''') are prepared showing to which part of the field each scoring shot by a batsman was made (revealing the batman's favourite places to hit the ball)<ref>[http://eye-cam.tumblr.com/post/125358292001/cricket-batting-wagon-wheels-various-sources Wagonwheel]</ref>\n\nTechnology such as [[Hawk-Eye]] allows for more detailed analysis of a bowler's performance. For instance the '''beehive''' chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the '''pitch map''' shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths). Both charts can also show the results of these balls (dots, runs, boundaries, or wickets)<ref>[http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/?page_id=1012 Hawk-eye innovations: beehive and pitch map]</ref>\n\n==Scoring notation==\n\nA cricket scorer will typically mark the score sheet with a dot for a legal delivery with no wicket taken or runs scored (hence the term \"a dot ball\") where conventional runs are taken the score sheet is marked with the number of runs taken on that delivery.\n\nSpecial notation is used in the case of extras.\n\n===Wides===\n\n\n[[File:Wides E.jpg|thumb|Cricket Scorers' wides notation]]\n\nThe conventional scoring notation for a wide is an equal cross (likened to the umpire standing with arms outstretched signalling a wide).\n\nIf the batsmen run byes on a wide ball or the ball runs to the boundary for 4, a dot is added in each corner for each bye that is run, typically top left, then top right, then bottom left and finally all 4 corners.\n\nIf the batsman hits the stumps with his bat, or the wicket-keeper stumps him, the batsman would be out and a \u2018W\u2019 is added to the WIDE \u2018cross\u2019 symbol. \n\nIf a batsman is run out while taking byes on a wide delivery then the number of completed runs are shown as dots and an 'R' is added in the corner for the incomplete run.\n\n===No-balls===\n\n[[File:No Balls.jpg|No-Balls]]\n\nThe conventional notation for a no-ball is a circle. If the batsman hits the ball and takes runs, then the runs are marked inside the circle. In practice it is easier to write down the number then encircle it. \n \nIf a no-ball delivery eludes the wicket keeper and the batsmen run byes or the ball runs to the boundary for 4 byes, each bye taken is marked with a dot inside the circle. Again it is easier to encircle the dots.\n\n===Byes===\n\nThe conventional notation for a single bye is a triangle with a horizontal edge at the base and a point at the top. If more than one bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n===Leg byes===\n\nThe conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n==Scores and points==\nIn most one day competitions based on leagues, 2 points are awarded for a win and 0 for a loss, regardless of the margin of victory.\n\nIn [[County Championship]] matches league points are awarded to teams not only for winning (scoring more runs overall) or drawing a game, but also for the number of runs scored or wickets taken in the first innings of the match. These extra batting and bowling points can make a difference to who becomes the champions at the end of the season.\n\nIn a series of [[Test cricket|Test matches]], the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having the same number of wins (since match draws are a distinct possibility with Test cricket; a series need not have all games on record coming to a decision). However, in [[the Ashes]] (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n* [[Cricket statistics]]\n* [[Laws of cricket]]\n* [[Glossary of cricket terms]]\n* [[Association of Cricket Officials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* For a comprehensive guide to the laws and their interpretation, and for guidance to scorers: ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' ([[Marylebone Cricket Club]]). {{ISBN|978-0-297-86641-1}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cricket umpiring]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Scoring (cricket)|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:This is scoring.OGG|right|thumb|300px|How runs are scored and teams win a match]]\n'''Scoring''' in [[cricket]] matches involves two elements \u2013 the number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the number of [[wicket (cricket)|wickets]] lost by each team. The '''scorer''' is someone appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s bowled. In professional games, in compliance with the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', two scorers are appointed, most often one provided by each team.\n\nThe scorers have no say in whether runs or extras are scored, wickets taken or overs bowled.  This is the job of the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]]s on the field of play, who signal to the scorers in cases of ambiguity such as when runs are to be given as extras rather than credited to the batsmen, or when the batsman is to be awarded a boundary 4 or 6. So that the umpire knows that they have seen each signal, the scorers are required to immediately acknowledge it.\n\nWhile it is possible to keep score using a pencil and plain paper, scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles.  Simple score books allow the recording of each [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman's]] runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowlers']] analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket.  More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman.  Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers.  It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored.  Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.\n\nIn early times runs scored were sometimes simply recorded by carving notches on a stick{{snd}}this root of the use of the slang term \"notches\" for \"runs\".  In contrast, scoring in the modern game has become a specialism, particularly for international and national cricket competitions.  While the scorers' role is clearly defined under the ''Laws of Cricket'' to be merely the recording of runs, wickets and overs, and the constant checking of the accuracy of their records with each other and with the umpires, in practice a modern scorer's role is complicated by other requirements. For instance, cricket authorities often require information about matters such as the rate at which teams bowled their overs. The media also ask to be notified of records, statistics and averages. For many important matches, unofficial scorers keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists allowing the official scorers to concentrate undisturbed.  In the English county game, the scorers also keep score on a computer that updates a central server, to meet the demands of the online press that scores should be as up-to-date as possible.\n\nThe official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these may be corrected after the event.\n\nSome cricket statisticians who keep score unofficially for the printed and broadcast media have become quite famous, for instance [[Bill Frindall]], who scored for the [[BBC]] radio commentary team from 1966 to 2008, and [[Jo King]].\n\nThe [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s [[Association of Cricket Officials]] provides training for scorers.<ref>[https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/78963 ECB ACO] Education \u2013 scorer courses (\"Scorers Count\")</ref>\n\n==Methods of scoring==\n[[Image:Cricketscoredcard1b.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a scorecard]]\nThere are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerised.\n\nThe manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.\n\nMost software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.\n\nIn addition to PC software, mobile apps are being used. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. There are several cricket scoring apps<ref>[https://medium.com/cricheroes/6-live-scoring-apps-for-your-local-cricket-match-799df9d7b83f  Cricket Scoring Apps For Your Local Cricket Match]</ref> such as Total Cricket Scorer (TCS), a  comprehensive program favoured many scorers in the County Championship{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}} in England, CricHQ, CricHeroes, CricScores, CricksLab, CricClubs, Chauka etc.. TCS was bought out by CricHQ in late 2015.  Mobile apps allow amateur cricketers to keep their scores online, and also provide them with personalised statistics and graphs on their own mobile devices.\n\nThe ECB make free software available for cricket scoring both on PC and mobile devices from the PlayCricket website.\n\n==Referring to scores==\n[[File:Adelaide Scoreboard1206.jpg|thumb|right|The [[scoreboard]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]].]]\nThe score of a [[cricket]] team whose [[innings]] is in progress is given as the number of [[run (cricket)|run]]s they have scored \"''for''\" the number of [[wicket]]s their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of \"''one hundred for three''\", written 100\u20133 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100\u20133 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3\u2013100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of \"''three hundred all out''\", rather than \"''three hundred for ten''\"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team [[Declaration and forfeiture|declare]] their innings closed (in a [[First-class cricket|First-class]] match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275\u20137. A declaration is noted by appending a \"d\" or \"dec\" to the score (for example 300\u20138d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word \"declared\" appended (example: \"''300 for 8, declared''\").\n\nIn a two-innings match, the scores of each team for their two innings are always given separately rather than being totalled, and the current score is stated in terms of how many runs the batting team lead or trail by. An example of a score for a two-innings match in progress would be: Team A 240 & 300\u20137d, Team B 225 & 130\u20134. This indicates that Team A in their first innings scored 240 runs, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed, and Team B are currently 130 for 4 \u2013 in this scenario, Team B currently trail by 185 runs (and are said to be facing a ''target'' or ''run chase'' of 316, the score with which they would win the match). If a team has [[follow-on|followed on]] in its second innings, this is indicated by appending \"(f/o)\" to their score, e.g. Team A 513, Team B 145 & 254\u20137 (f/o).\n\nWhen a game is completed, there are standard ways of referring to the difference in scores between the two teams. For instance, if Team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136, then Team B, batting second, only scored 185, whether or not they go all out, it would be said that \"''Team A won by 69 runs''\" because they either bowled out the opposition or caused them to exhaust their overs (in a limited-overs match) when they were trailing by 69 runs. On the other hand, if team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136 but team B, batting second, scored 255\u20138, it would be said that \"''team B won by 2 wickets''\" because they reached their target with 2 wickets remaining. In a two-innings match, a team can win having only batted once (while the other team, batting twice, has not equalled the other team's score). For instance, team A score 160 all out, team B score 530 and declare, then team A score 230 all out. In this case it would be said that \"''team B won by an innings and 140 runs''\".\n\n==Winning scores==\nIn [[Limited overs cricket|limited over matches]] (one innings matches), the team that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs with the loss of 1 wicket (250\u20131), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251\u20139), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar situation if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.\n\nIn limited overs matches shortened by bad weather, the winning team is the one whose scoring is best according to the targets set by a rain rule, usually the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]. The method used to set targets takes into account both the number of overs and the number of wickets lost.\n\nIn [[First-class cricket]] (two innings match), the team that scores more runs, having dismissed its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not much time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316\u20139, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.\n\nThe terms ''draw'' and ''tie'', which are synonymous in many sports, have distinct meanings in cricket. A tie refers to a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but rather is said to have ''no result''.\nHowever, in the case of a tournament final, the match may be decided by an extra over, or awarded to the team with the most boundaries scored, or least wickets lost, or another method indicated by the rules of the tournament. This was the case in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, awarded to England on most boundaries scored after a tie and an extra over (super over), after scores remained level.\n\n==Detailed scoring==\n{{see also|Scoring runs in cricket}}\nCricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:\n*For each ball, who bowled it and how many runs were scored from it, whether by the batsman with his bat ('off the bat') or [[byes]].\n*For each batsman, every scoring run made.\n*For each [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]], the kind of dismissal (e.g. [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] or [[run out]]), the bowler (in the case of a bowling, LBW, catch, wicket hit, or stumping), any other player involved (in the case of a catch, run out, or stumping), as well as the total the batting team reached at that point in the game ('the fall of wicket'). Example notations as seen on cricket scorecards:\n:*''c ''fielder'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Caught]]\n:*''c & b ''bowler \u2013 Caught & bowled (the bowler was also the catching fielder)\n:*''b ''bowler \u2013 [[Bowled]]\n:*''lbw b ''bowler \u2013 [[Leg before wicket]]\n:*''st ''wicket-keeper'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Stumped]]\n:*''hit wicket'' ''b'' bowler - [[Hit wicket]]\n*For each bowler (his 'figures'), the number of overs bowled, the number of wickets taken, the number of runs conceded, and the number of [[maiden over]]s bowled.\n\nTraditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball.  Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by [[John Atkinson Pendlington]], [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] and [[Bill Frindall]], to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler.

For instance the '''beehive''' chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the '''pitch map''' shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths).

If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n==Scores and points==\nIn most one day competitions based on leagues, 2 points are awarded for a win and 0 for a loss, regardless of the margin of victory.\n\nIn [[County Championship]] matches league points are awarded to teams not only for winning (scoring more runs overall) or drawing a game, but also for the number of runs scored or wickets taken in the first innings of the match. These extra batting and bowling points can make a difference to who becomes the champions at the end of the season.\n\nIn a series of [[Test cricket|Test matches]], the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having the same number of wins (since match draws are a distinct possibility with Test cricket; a series need not have all games on record coming to a decision). However, in [[the Ashes]] (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n* [[Cricket statistics]]\n* [[Laws of cricket]]\n* [[Glossary of cricket terms]]\n* [[Association of Cricket Officials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* For a comprehensive guide to the laws and their interpretation, and for guidance to scorers: ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' ([[Marylebone Cricket Club]]). {{ISBN|978-0-297-86641-1}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cricket umpiring]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Scoring (cricket)|*]]\n", "name_user": "Latestbhojpuriya", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_(cricket)"}

Arjuna questions how Krishna could do this, when those sages lived so long ago, and Krishna was born more recently. Krishna reminds him that everyone is in the cycle of rebirths, and while Arjuna does not remember his previous births, he does. Whenever ''dharma'' declines and the purpose of life is forgotten by men, says Krishna, he returns to re-establish ''dharma''.{{refn|group=note|This is the [[avatara]] concept found in the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism.{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|pp=111\u2013122}}}} Every time he returns, he teaches about inner Self in all beings. The later verses of the chapter return to the discussion of motiveless action and the need to determine the right action, performing it as one's ''dharma'' (duty) while renouncing the results, rewards, fruits.

The term ''dharma'' has a number of meanings.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Fundamentally, it means \"what is right\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Contexually, it also means the essence of \"duty, law, class, social norms, ritual and cosmos itself\" in the text, in the sense \"the way things should be in all these different dimensions\", states Fowler.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Zaehner, the term ''dharma'' means \"duty\" in Gita's context, in verse 2.7 refers to the \"right [and wrong]\", and in 14.27 to \"eternal law of righteousness\".{{sfn|Zaehner|1969|pp=123, 382}}\n\nFew verses in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' deal with ''dharma'', according to the Indologist Paul Hacker, but the theme of ''dharma'' is important in it.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=260}} In Chapter 1, responding to [[Arjuna|Arjuna's]] despondency, [[Krishna]] asks him to follow his ''sva-dharma'',{{sfn|Hacker|1958|pp=1\u201315}} \"the ''dharma'' that belongs to a particular man (Arjuna) as a member of a particular ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'', (i.e., the ''kshatriya'' \u2013 the warrior varna)\".{{sfn|Hacker||1958|p=261}} According to Paul Hacker, the term ''dharma'' has additional meanings in the context of Arjuna. It is more broadly, the \"duty\" and a \"metaphysically congealed act\" for Arjuna.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=261}} According to the Indologist Jacqueline Hirst, the ''dharma'' theme is \"of significance only at the beginning and end of the ''Gita''\" and this may have been a way to perhaps link the ''Gita'' to the context of the ''Mahabharata''.<ref name=\"Hirst1997p48\">{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Hirst|editor=Julius Lipner|title=The Fruits of Our Desiring: An Enquiry Into the Ethics of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tk9YBPOl36UC&pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Bayeux|isbn=978-1-896209-30-2|page=48}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Malinar, \"Arjuna's crisis and some of the arguments put forward to call him to action are connected to the debates on war and peace in the ''[[Udyoga Parva]]''.\"{{sfn|Malinar|2007|p=36}} The ''Udyoga Parva'' presents many views about the nature of a warrior, his duty and what calls for heroic action. While [[Duryodhana]] presents it as a matter of status, social norms, and fate, [[Vidura]] states that the heroic warrior never submits, knows no fear and has the duty to protect people.{{sfn|Malinar|2007|pp=36\u201341}} The ''[[Bhishma Parva|Bhishma parva]]'' sets the stage of two ideologies in conflict and two massive armies gathered for what each considers as a righteous and necessary war. In this context, the ''Gita'' advises Arjuna to do his holy duty (''sva-dharma'') as a warrior, fight and kill.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=59}}{{sfn|Malinar|2007|pp=36\u201339}}\n\nAccording to the Indologist Barbara Miller, the text frames heroism not in terms of physical abilities, but instead in terms of effort and inner commitment to fulfill a warrior's ''dharma'' in the battlefield.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} War is depicted as a horror, the impending slaughter a cause of self-doubts, yet at stake is the spiritual struggle against evil.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} The ''Gita'' message emphasizes that the personal moral confusion and struggle must be addressed, the warrior needs to rise beyond \"personal and social values\" and understand what is at stake and \"why he must fight\", states Miller. The text explores the \"paradoxical interconnectedness of disciplined action and freedom\".{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n==== ''The Field of Dharma'' ====\nThe first reference to ''dharma'' in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' occurs in its first verse, where [[Dhritarashtra]] refers to the Kurukshetra, the location of the battlefield, as the ''Field of Dharma'', \"The Field of Righteousness or Truth\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Fowler, ''dharma'' in this verse may refer to the ''[[sanatana dharma]]'', \"what Hindus understand as their religion, for it is a term that encompasses wide aspects of religious and traditional thought and is more readily used for religion\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Therefore, 'Field of action' implies the field of righteousness, where truth will eventually triumph, states Fowler.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Jacqueline Hirst, the \"field of ''dharma''\" phrase in the ''Gita'' epitomizes that the struggle concerns ''dharma'' itself. This ''dharma'' has \"resonances at many different levels\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Hirst|editor=Julius Lipner|title=The Fruits of Our Desiring: An Enquiry Into the Ethics of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tk9YBPOl36UC&pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Bayeux|isbn=978-1-896209-30-2|pages=50\u201358}}</ref>\n\n\"The Field of Dharma\" is also called the \"Field of action\" by [[Sri Aurobindo]], a freedom fighter and philosopher.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], a professor of Philosophy at the Oxford University and the second president of India, saw \"The Field of Dharma\" as the world (Bhavsagar), which is a \"battleground for moral struggle\".<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|page=2}}</ref>\n\n==== Allegory of war ====\nUnlike any other religious scripture, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' broadcasts its message in the centre of the battlefield.<ref>{{harvnb|Krishnananda|1980|pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Several modern Indian writers have interpreted the battlefield setting as an allegory of \"the war within\".{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=15}} [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the ''Gita''{{'}}s subject is \"the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious\".<ref>{{harvnb|Easwaran|2007|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Swami Nikhilananda]], takes Arjuna as an allegory of \u0100tman, Krishna as an allegory of ''[[Brahman]]'', Arjuna's chariot as the body, and Dhritarashtra as the ignorance filled mind.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Nikhilananda|Hocking|2006|page=2}} \"Arjuna represents the individual soul, and Sri Krishna the Supreme Soul dwelling in every heart.

But there is this much of truth in the view, that the setting of the doctrine though not symbolical, is certainly typical.<ref name=\"THD\"/>}}\n\n==== Promotion of [[just war]] and duty ====\nOther scholars such as Steven Rosen, Laurie L. Patton and Stephen Mitchell have seen in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's ([[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]) duty (''svadharma''), which is to conduct combat and [[war]] with courage and do not see this as only an allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of [[just war]].<ref>Rosen, Steven; Krishna's Song: A New Look at the Bhagavad Gita, p. 22.</ref><ref>Patton, Laurie L.; The Failure of Allegory in ''Fighting Words''</ref>\n\nIndian independence leaders like [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as a text which defended war when necessary and used it to promote war against the British Empire. Lajpat Rai wrote an article on the \"Message of the Bhagavad Gita\". He saw the main message as the bravery and courage of Arjuna to fight as a warrior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M.V. Nadkarni|2016|pp=Chapter 4}}</ref> [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as defending killing when necessary for the betterment of society, such as, for example, the killing of [[Afzal Khan (general)|Afzal Khan]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Moksha: Liberation ===\n{{Main|Moksha}}\nLiberation or ''[[moksha]]'' in [[Vedanta]] philosophy is not something that can be acquired. ''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0100tman]]'' (Soul) and Self-knowledge, along with the loss of egotistic ignorance, the goal of ''moksha'', is something that is always present as the essence of the self, and must be realized by each person by one's own effort. While the [[Upanishads]] largely uphold such a monistic viewpoint of liberation, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' also accommodates the dualistic and theistic aspects of ''moksha''. The ''Gita'', while including impersonal ''Nirguna Brahman'' as the goal, mainly revolves around the relationship between the Self and a personal God or ''[[Saguna Brahman]]''. A synthesis of knowledge, devotion, and desireless action is offered by Krishna as a spectrum of choices to Arjuna; the same combination is suggested to the reader as a way to moksha.<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|pages=xlv\u2013xlviii}}</ref> Christopher Chapple \u2013 a Comparative Theology scholar focusing on Indian religions, in [[Winthrop Sargeant]] translation of the ''Gita'', states, \"In the model presented by the ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101'', every aspect of life is in fact a way of salvation.\"{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|pages=xxii\u2013xxiii}}\n\n===Pancaratra Agama===\nAccording to Dennis Hudson, there is an overlap between Vedic and Tantric rituals with the teachings found in the ''Bhagavad Gita''.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=9, 160\u2013163}} He places the ''Pancaratra Agama'' in the last three or four centuries of 1st-millennium BCE, and proposes that both the tantric and vedic, the Agama and the Gita share the same Vasudeva-Krishna roots.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=133}} Some of the ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' connect it to the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' of ''[[Yajurveda]]''. The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', for example, mentions the absolute Purusha who dwells in every human being. A story in this vedic text, states Hudson, highlights the meaning of the name Vasudeva as the 'shining one (deva) who dwells (vasu) in all things and in whom all things dwell', and the meaning of Vishnu to be the 'pervading actor'. In Bhagavad Gita, similarly, 'Krishna identified himself both with Vasudeva, Vishnu and their meanings'.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}{{refn|group=note|Other parallelism include verse 10.21 of Gita replicating the structure of verse 1.2.5 of the Shatapatha Brahmana.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=157}}}} The ideas at the center of Vedic rituals in ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' and the teachings of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' revolve around this absolute Person, the primordial genderless absolute, which is same as the goal of Pancaratra Agama and Tantra.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n== Translations ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 1785 Bhagavad Gita translation English.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = 1787 Bhagavad Gita re-translation French.jpg\n\n| width2 = 143\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Bhagvat - Geeta, Wesleyan Mission Press, Bangalore, 1849.jpg\n| width3 = 200\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Cover pages of early ''Gita'' translations.

He is advised by Krishna to do his ''sva-dharma'', a term that has been variously interpreted. According to the Indologist Paul Hacker, the contextual meaning in the ''Gita'' is the \"dharma of a particular varna\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=264}} Neo-Hindus such as Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, states Hacker, have preferred to not translate it in those terms, or \"dharma\" as religion, but leave ''Gita's'' message as \"everyone must follow his ''sva-dharma''\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Chatterjee, the Hindus already understand the meaning of that term. To render it in English for non-Hindus for its better understanding, one must ask ''what is the sva-dharma for the non-Hindus''? The Lord, states Chatterjee, created millions and millions of people, and he did not ordain ''dharma'' only for Indians [Hindus] and \"make all the others dharma-less\", for \"are not the non-Hindus also his children\"? According to Chatterjee, the Krishna's religion of ''Gita'' is \"not so narrow-minded\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} This argument, states Hacker, is an attempt to \"universalize Hinduism\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nThe ''Gita'' has been cited and criticized as a Hindu text that supports ''varna-dharma'' and the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Mason |title=The Caste System of India |journal=American Sociological Review | publisher=Sage Publications | volume=9 |issue=6 |year=1944 |doi=10.2307/2085128 |pages=648\u2013657|jstor=2085128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC | year=2001| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-79842-6| pages=13\u201314}}</ref>{{sfn|Maitra|2018|p=22}} [[B.

According to the Indologist Ananya Vajpeyi, the ''Gita'' does not elaborate on the means or stages of war, nor on ''ahimsa'', except for stating that \"''ahimsa'' is virtuous and characterizes an awakened, steadfast, ethical man\" in verses such as 13.7\u201310 and 16.1\u20135.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\">{{cite book|author=Ananya Vajpeyi|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC&pg=PA66 |year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06728-8|pages=66\u201367}}</ref> For Gandhi, states Vajpeyi, ''ahimsa'' is the \"relationship between self and other\" while he and his fellow Indians battled against the colonial rule. Gandhian ahimsa is in fact \"the essence of the entire ''Gita''\", according to Vajpeyi.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\"/> The teachings of the ''Gita'' on ''ahimsa'' are ambiguous, states Arvind Sharma, and this is best exemplified by the fact that Nathuram Godse stated the ''Gita'' as his inspiration to do his ''dharma'' after he [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Mahatma Gandhi]].{{sfn|Sharma|1986|pp=xiv\u2013xv}} [[Thomas Merton]], the Trappist monk and author of books on Zen Buddhism, concurs with Gandhi and states that the ''Gita'' is not teaching violence nor propounding a \"make war\" ideology. Instead, it is teaching peace and discussing one's duty to examine what is right and then act with pure intentions, when one's faces difficult and repugnant choices.{{sfn|Miller|1986|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\n=== Largest copy ===\nThe world's largest Bhagavad Gita is in the [[ISKCON Temple Delhi]], which claims to be the world's largest sacred book of any religion.

Everything that constitutes ''[[prakriti]]'' (nature, matter) is process driven and has a finite existence. It is born, grows, matures, decays and dies. It considers this transient reality as ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''.

Krishna is all and One.<ref name=\"Franklin Edgerton 1952 44\u201345 with footnotes, context: pp. 30\u201354 Part 2\"/> According to [[Huston Smith]], the ''Gita'' is teaching that \"when one sees the entire universe as pervaded by the single Universal Spirit [Krishna], one contemplates, marvels, and falls in love with its amazing glory.

This is how the flower of devotion evolves into the fruit of knowledge.\"{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=xvii}}\n\n==== Means to God ====\nThe ''Gita'' teaches several spiritual paths \u2013 jnana, bhakti and karma \u2013 to the divine. However, states Fowler, it \"does not raise any of these to a status that excludes the others\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|pp= xl}} The theme that unites these paths in the ''Gita'' is \"inner renunciation\" where one is unattached to personal rewards during one's spiritual journey.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|pp= xl}}\n\n==== Karma yoga ====\n{{Main|Karma yoga}}\nThe ''Gita'' teaches the path of ''Karma yoga'' in Chapter 3 and others.

The term ''dharma'' has a number of meanings.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Fundamentally, it means \"what is right\".{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} Contexually, it also means the essence of \"duty, law, class, social norms, ritual and cosmos itself\" in the text, in the sense \"the way things should be in all these different dimensions\", states Fowler.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=2}} According to Zaehner, the term ''dharma'' means \"duty\" in Gita's context, in verse 2.7 refers to the \"right [and wrong]\", and in 14.27 to \"eternal law of righteousness\".{{sfn|Zaehner|1969|pp=123, 382}}\n\nFew verses in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' deal with ''dharma'', according to the Indologist Paul Hacker, but the theme of ''dharma'' is important in it.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=260}} In Chapter 1, responding to [[Arjuna|Arjuna's]] despondency, [[Krishna]] asks him to follow his ''sva-dharma'',{{sfn|Hacker|1958|pp=1\u201315}} \"the ''dharma'' that belongs to a particular man (Arjuna) as a member of a particular ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'', (i.e., the ''kshatriya'' \u2013 the warrior varna)\".{{sfn|Hacker||1958|p=261}} According to Paul Hacker, the term ''dharma'' has additional meanings in the context of Arjuna. It is more broadly, the \"duty\" and a \"metaphysically congealed act\" for Arjuna.{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=261}} According to the Indologist Jacqueline Hirst, the ''dharma'' theme is \"of significance only at the beginning and end of the ''Gita''\" and this may have been a way to perhaps link the ''Gita'' to the context of the ''Mahabharata''.<ref name=\"Hirst1997p48\">{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Hirst|editor=Julius Lipner|title=The Fruits of Our Desiring: An Enquiry Into the Ethics of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tk9YBPOl36UC&pg=PA48|year=1997|publisher=Bayeux|isbn=978-1-896209-30-2|page=48}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Malinar, \"Arjuna's crisis and some of the arguments put forward to call him to action are connected to the debates on war and peace in the ''[[Udyoga Parva]]''.\"{{sfn|Malinar|2007|p=36}} The ''Udyoga Parva'' presents many views about the nature of a warrior, his duty and what calls for heroic action.

In this context, the ''Gita'' advises Arjuna to do his holy duty (''sva-dharma'') as a warrior, fight and kill.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=59}}{{sfn|Malinar|2007|pp=36\u201339}}\n\nAccording to the Indologist Barbara Miller, the text frames heroism not in terms of physical abilities, but instead in terms of effort and inner commitment to fulfill a warrior's ''dharma'' in the battlefield.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} War is depicted as a horror, the impending slaughter a cause of self-doubts, yet at stake is the spiritual struggle against evil.{{sfn| Miller|1986|pp=1\u20138}} The ''Gita'' message emphasizes that the personal moral confusion and struggle must be addressed, the warrior needs to rise beyond \"personal and social values\" and understand what is at stake and \"why he must fight\", states Miller.

Patton and Stephen Mitchell have seen in the Gita a religious defense of the warrior class's ([[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]) duty (''svadharma''), which is to conduct combat and [[war]] with courage and do not see this as only an allegorical teaching, but also a real defense of [[just war]].<ref>Rosen, Steven; Krishna's Song: A New Look at the Bhagavad Gita, p. 22.</ref><ref>Patton, Laurie L.; The Failure of Allegory in ''Fighting Words''</ref>\n\nIndian independence leaders like [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] saw the Gita as a text which defended war when necessary and used it to promote war against the British Empire. Lajpat Rai wrote an article on the \"Message of the Bhagavad Gita\". He saw the main message as the bravery and courage of Arjuna to fight as a warrior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M.V.

''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0100tman]]'' (Soul) and Self-knowledge, along with the loss of egotistic ignorance, the goal of ''moksha'', is something that is always present as the essence of the self, and must be realized by each person by one's own effort. While the [[Upanishads]] largely uphold such a monistic viewpoint of liberation, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' also accommodates the dualistic and theistic aspects of ''moksha''. The ''Gita'', while including impersonal ''Nirguna Brahman'' as the goal, mainly revolves around the relationship between the Self and a personal God or ''[[Saguna Brahman]]''. A synthesis of knowledge, devotion, and desireless action is offered by Krishna as a spectrum of choices to Arjuna; the same combination is suggested to the reader as a way to moksha.<ref>{{harvnb|Fowler|2012|pages=xlv\u2013xlviii}}</ref> Christopher Chapple \u2013 a Comparative Theology scholar focusing on Indian religions, in [[Winthrop Sargeant]] translation of the ''Gita'', states, \"In the model presented by the ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101'', every aspect of life is in fact a way of salvation.\"{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|pages=xxii\u2013xxiii}}\n\n===Pancaratra Agama===\nAccording to Dennis Hudson, there is an overlap between Vedic and Tantric rituals with the teachings found in the ''Bhagavad Gita''.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=9, 160\u2013163}} He places the ''Pancaratra Agama'' in the last three or four centuries of 1st-millennium BCE, and proposes that both the tantric and vedic, the Agama and the Gita share the same Vasudeva-Krishna roots.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=133}} Some of the ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' connect it to the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' of ''[[Yajurveda]]''. The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', for example, mentions the absolute Purusha who dwells in every human being. A story in this vedic text, states Hudson, highlights the meaning of the name Vasudeva as the 'shining one (deva) who dwells (vasu) in all things and in whom all things dwell', and the meaning of Vishnu to be the 'pervading actor'. In Bhagavad Gita, similarly, 'Krishna identified himself both with Vasudeva, Vishnu and their meanings'.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}{{refn|group=note|Other parallelism include verse 10.21 of Gita replicating the structure of verse 1.2.5 of the Shatapatha Brahmana.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|p=157}}}} The ideas at the center of Vedic rituals in ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' and the teachings of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' revolve around this absolute Person, the primordial genderless absolute, which is same as the goal of Pancaratra Agama and Tantra.{{sfn|Hudson|2002|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n== Translations ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 1785 Bhagavad Gita translation English.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = 1787 Bhagavad Gita re-translation French.jpg\n\n| width2 = 143\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Bhagvat - Geeta, Wesleyan Mission Press, Bangalore, 1849.jpg\n| width3 = 200\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Cover pages of early ''Gita'' translations.

He is advised by Krishna to do his ''sva-dharma'', a term that has been variously interpreted. According to the Indologist Paul Hacker, the contextual meaning in the ''Gita'' is the \"dharma of a particular varna\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|p=264}} Neo-Hindus such as Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, states Hacker, have preferred to not translate it in those terms, or \"dharma\" as religion, but leave ''Gita's'' message as \"everyone must follow his ''sva-dharma''\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Chatterjee, the Hindus already understand the meaning of that term. To render it in English for non-Hindus for its better understanding, one must ask ''what is the sva-dharma for the non-Hindus''? The Lord, states Chatterjee, created millions and millions of people, and he did not ordain ''dharma'' only for Indians [Hindus] and \"make all the others dharma-less\", for \"are not the non-Hindus also his children\"? According to Chatterjee, the Krishna's religion of ''Gita'' is \"not so narrow-minded\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}} This argument, states Hacker, is an attempt to \"universalize Hinduism\".{{sfn|Hacker|Halbfass|1995|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nThe ''Gita'' has been cited and criticized as a Hindu text that supports ''varna-dharma'' and the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Mason |title=The Caste System of India |journal=American Sociological Review | publisher=Sage Publications | volume=9 |issue=6 |year=1944 |doi=10.2307/2085128 |pages=648\u2013657|jstor=2085128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC | year=2001| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-79842-6| pages=13\u201314}}</ref>{{sfn|Maitra|2018|p=22}} [[B.

For Gandhi, the ''Gita'' is teaching that people should fight for justice and righteous values, that they should never meekly suffer injustice to avoid a war. According to the Indologist Ananya Vajpeyi, the ''Gita'' does not elaborate on the means or stages of war, nor on ''ahimsa'', except for stating that \"''ahimsa'' is virtuous and characterizes an awakened, steadfast, ethical man\" in verses such as 13.7\u201310 and 16.1\u20135.<ref name=\"Vajpeyi2012p66\">{{cite book|author=Ananya Vajpeyi|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC&pg=PA66 |year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06728-8|pages=66\u201367}}</ref> For Gandhi, states Vajpeyi, ''ahimsa'' is the \"relationship between self and other\" while he and his fellow Indians battled against the colonial rule.

He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].\n \nModigliani's oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died of [[tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]], at the age of 34, in Paris.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Modigliani Birthplace Livorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani's birthplace in [[Livorno]]]]\n\nModigliani was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Livorno]], Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/modiglianis-sephardic-jewish-background-didnt-know/|title=Heroes \u2013 Trailblazers of the Jewish People|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community]]. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 13| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nModigliani's mother, Eug\u00e9nie Garsin, born and raised in [[Marseille]], was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.<ref>Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16\u201318</ref><ref name=\"Beyond the Myth\">[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]</ref>\n\nModigliani's father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani's mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\n\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H.

When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson | page = 14| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\n==Art student years==\nModigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself \"already a painter\", his mother wrote,<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 12}}</ref> even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].\n\n===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only 2 citations-->\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, c.1915, Portrait de Picasso, oil on cardboard, 43.2 x 26.7 cm.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Pablo Picasso,'' 1915, private collection]]\n[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been [[Llewelyn Lloyd (painter)|Llewelyn Lloyd]], [[Giulio Cesare Vinzio]], [[Manlio Martinelli]], [[Gino Romiti]], [[Renato Natali]], and [[Oscar Ghiglia]]. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the [[Macchiaioli]]\" (from ''macchia''&nbsp;\u2014\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\n\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in caf\u00e9s, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref> Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[C\u00e9zanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.\n\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\" />\n\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].\nIt is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Chaim Soutine (1917).jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Chaim Soutine]],'' 1916]]\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|''Caryatid'', now at [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] ]]\n\n===Early literary influences===\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\n\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n\n<blockquote>(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe work of [[Lautr\u00e9amont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\" /> The poetry of Lautr\u00e9amont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.\n\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19\u201322}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself.

In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for \u2018The Pillars of Tenderness\u2019 which would support the imagined temple.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]\nModigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in the [[Bateau-Lavoir]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref> a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented\u2014initially, at least\u2014as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" /> He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\n===Transformation===\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\n\nThe poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\n\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183</ref> Tuberculosis\u2014the leading cause of death in France by 1900<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181</ref>\u2014was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298</ref>\n\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182</ref>\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nHe sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\" /> Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]].

Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.\"<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 20| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nSome art historians suggest<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\" /> that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.\n\n===Output===\nDuring his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost\u2014destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.<ref name=\"werner-24\" />\n\nHe was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.\n\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html \"Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him\"] Retrieved 21 July 2015</ref> Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other.

He died on January 24, 1920, at the [[H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9]].\n\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old H\u00e9buterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.\n\nA day later, H\u00e9buterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, two days after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. H\u00e9buterne was buried at the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux]] near [[Paris]], and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: \"Struck down by death at the moment of glory\". Hers reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Journal\">{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Lappin |authorlink=Linda Lappin |date=June 22, 2002 |title=Missing person in Montparnasse: The case of Jeanne Hebuterne |journal=Literary Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=785\u2013811 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610085904/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nManaging only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani in 1919, near the end of his life]]\n[[File:AmedeoModigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Modigliani and H\u00e9buterne in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]]]\n\n===Influences===\nThe linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painters]] informed his work. Working during that fertile period of \u201cisms,\u201d [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, \u201cThis is what I see.\u201d\n\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]\u2019s proclamation: \u201cNe t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t wait with the avant-garde\u201d).<ref>Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A.

He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].\n \nModigliani's oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity.

Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.<ref>Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16\u201318</ref><ref name=\"Beyond the Myth\">[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]</ref>\n\nModigliani's father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani's mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\n\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H.

When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it.

Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].\n\n===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only 2 citations-->\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, c.1915, Portrait de Picasso, oil on cardboard, 43.2 x 26.7 cm.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Pablo Picasso,'' 1915, private collection]]\n[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900.

Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the [[Macchiaioli]]\" (from ''macchia''&nbsp;\u2014\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\n\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in caf\u00e9s, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref> Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[C\u00e9zanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.\n\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\" />\n\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].\nIt is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Chaim Soutine (1917).jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Chaim Soutine]],'' 1916]]\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|''Caryatid'', now at [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] ]]\n\n===Early literary influences===\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\n\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n\n<blockquote>(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe work of [[Lautr\u00e9amont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\" /> The poetry of Lautr\u00e9amont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.\n\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19\u201322}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself.

In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for \u2018The Pillars of Tenderness\u2019 which would support the imagined temple.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]\nModigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in the [[Bateau-Lavoir]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref> a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented\u2014initially, at least\u2014as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" /> He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\n===Transformation===\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\n\nThe poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\n\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183</ref> Tuberculosis\u2014the leading cause of death in France by 1900<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181</ref>\u2014was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298</ref>\n\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182</ref>\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nHe sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\" /> Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]].

Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.\"<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 20| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nSome art historians suggest<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\" /> that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.\n\n===Output===\nDuring his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost\u2014destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.<ref name=\"werner-24\" />\n\nHe was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.\n\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html \"Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him\"] Retrieved 21 July 2015</ref> Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other.

From a conservative [[bourgeois]] background, H\u00e9buterne was renounced by her devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.\n\nModigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings and a short time later H\u00e9buterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne H\u00e9buterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.\n\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, ''Jeanne H\u00e9buterne'', oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nOn December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened at the [[Berthe Weill]] Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.\n\nTowards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with H\u00e9buterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]]. [[File:Portr\u00e4t der Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, Amedeo Modigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Jeanne H\u00e9buterne]], 1918]] After he and H\u00e9buterne moved to Nice on November 29, 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918\u20131984). In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re.\n \nH\u00e9buterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.\n\n==Death and funeral==\n\nAlthough he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.\n\nIn 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto H\u00e9buterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, [[tubercular meningitis]]. He died on January 24, 1920, at the [[H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9]].\n\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old H\u00e9buterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.\n\nA day later, H\u00e9buterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, two days after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. H\u00e9buterne was buried at the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux]] near [[Paris]], and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: \"Struck down by death at the moment of glory\". Hers reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Journal\">{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Lappin |authorlink=Linda Lappin |date=June 22, 2002 |title=Missing person in Montparnasse: The case of Jeanne Hebuterne |journal=Literary Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=785\u2013811 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610085904/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nManaging only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani in 1919, near the end of his life]]\n[[File:AmedeoModigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Modigliani and H\u00e9buterne in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]]]\n\n===Influences===\nThe linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painters]] informed his work. Working during that fertile period of \u201cisms,\u201d [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, \u201cThis is what I see.\u201d\n\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]\u2019s proclamation: \u201cNe t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t wait with the avant-garde\u201d).<ref>Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A.

As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled ''Modigliani: Man and Myth''.\n\n===Catalogue raisonn\u00e9s===\nThe Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world.

The \u201chistorical legacy thesis\u201d contends that the current wealth gap was created by the \u201chead start\u201d that White people have had in amassing wealth and inheriting wealth from generations prior.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Conley|first=Dalton|date=2001|title=\"Decomposing the Black-White Wealth Gap: The Role of Parental Resources, Inheritance, and Investment Dynamics.\"|url=|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=71.1|pages=39\u201366|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682x.2001.tb00927.x}}</ref> Continuous racial discrimination against Black Americans also contributes to this theory.<ref name=\":0\" /> The \u201ccontemporary dynamics thesis\u201d explains how modern phenomena, specifically systematic racism in the housing and credit markets, are the main source of the wealth gap.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1994, the typical Black American family had a net worth of $9,800, while a typical White family had a net worth of $72,000.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1997, the median family income of African American families was up to $26,522, 55% of the $47,023 of White families.<ref name=\":0\" /> Black wealth mostly consists of home equity and car ownership, while white wealth also includes financial assets, \"the key to wealth accumulation\".<ref name=\":0\" /> For this reason, the wealth gap between blacks and whites has continuously grown since the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Post-emancipation ===\nIn 1860, [[Free Negro|freed Black]] Americans owned approximately $50 million worth of land.<ref name=\":0\" /> Land redistribution was promised as reparations for freed slaves by President [[Andrew Johnson]] after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\":0\" /> This promise was not fulfilled for many. For those who did receive land, the ownership was temporary as land was eventually sold off to White individuals.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFormer slaves faced a slim job market and many were forced into [[sharecropping]], a system in which laborers rent land from a landlord to grow crops and provide a share of their crops as rent.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many blacks tried to escape this by getting wealthy and buying the land, but these attempts mostly failed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaido|first=Daniel|date=2000|title=\"A Materialist Analysis of Slavery and Sharecropping in the Southern United States.\"|url=|journal=Journal of Peasant Studies|volume=28.1|pages=55\u201394|via=|doi=10.1080/03066150008438758}}</ref>\n\n=== 1900\u20131938 ===\n1900-1938 marked what is considered the \u201cGolden Age of Black Business.\u201d In response to ''[[Plessy v.

Porter. In 1853, he claimed a {{convert|320|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel on the [[White River (Washington)|White River]], about three miles (5&nbsp;km) west of the site of Enumclaw. He maintained a troubled relationship with the local Smalkamish tribe (some of the ancestors of the [[Muckleshoot]] tribe) for some time, and in 1855 his cabin was burned to the ground. Porter, who had been warned in advance by a friend in the tribe, hid in the woods until they had left. After warning the settlers at [[Fort Steilacoom]], he left the area, moving to [[Roy, Washington|Roy]]. He would never return to Enumclaw.\n\nEnumclaw itself was homesteaded in 1879 by Frank and Mary Stevenson. In 1885, the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific Railroad]] routed their transcontinental mainline through the site, accepting their offer of cleared, level land on which to build a siding. Confident that the area would grow, the Stevensons filed a [[plat]] with King County that same year. They built a hotel and gave away lots for a saloon and a general store.\n\nAt first the people called the town 'Stevensonville' after the founders, who soon refused the honor. One resident suggested 'Enumclaw,' which was the name of the strange sawed-off promontory north of town. The name's uniqueness gained favor with the locals.\n\nOn January 11, 1895, Mount Baldy, a small peak above the town, \"erupted\" with tremendous fire and smoke, although no losses or damage were reported, and the conflagration was minimized by residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=416|title=Newspaper reports eruption of Mount Baldy on January 10, 1895. |work=[[HistoryLink]]}}</ref> Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the area was farmed for [[hops]]. When the hops crop failed due to pests and economic downturn, the residents turned to dairy farming, which has been a mainstay ever since. The first [[1900 United States Census|census]] listing Enumclaw in 1900 put the population at 483 people.\n\nIn the 1890s, the Northern Pacific Railroad rerouted their line through [[Palmer, Washington|Palmer]], a few miles to the east of town. In 1910, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] routed a branch line through Enumclaw.\n\nThe city was incorporated on January 27, 1913. In 1929, a much-anticipated route to [[Eastern Washington]] was opened across the [[Naches Pass|Naches Pass Highway]]. In the 1950s Enumclaw Insurance Group greatly expanded its business and the home office became a major employer in the town.

Porter. In 1853, he claimed a {{convert|320|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel on the [[White River (Washington)|White River]], about three miles (5&nbsp;km) west of the site of Enumclaw. He maintained a troubled relationship with the local Smalkamish tribe (some of the ancestors of the [[Muckleshoot]] tribe) for some time, and in 1855 his cabin was burned to the ground. Porter, who had been warned in advance by a friend in the tribe, hid in the woods until they had left. After warning the settlers at [[Fort Steilacoom]], he left the area, moving to [[Roy, Washington|Roy]]. He would never return to Enumclaw.\n\nEnumclaw itself was homesteaded in 1879 by Frank and Mary Stevenson. In 1885, the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific Railroad]] routed their transcontinental mainline through the site, accepting their offer of cleared, level land on which to build a siding. Confident that the area would grow, the Stevensons filed a [[plat]] with King County that same year. They built a hotel and gave away lots for a saloon and a general store.\n\nAt first the people called the town 'Stevensonville' after the founders, who soon refused the honor. One resident suggested 'Enumclaw,' which was the name of the strange sawed-off promontory north of town. The name's uniqueness gained favor with the locals.\n\nOn January 11, 1895, Mount Baldy, a small peak above the town, \"erupted\" with tremendous fire and smoke, although no losses or damage were reported, and the conflagration was minimized by residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=416|title=Newspaper reports eruption of Mount Baldy on January 10, 1895. |work=[[HistoryLink]]}}</ref> Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the area was farmed for [[hops]]. When the hops crop failed due to pests and economic downturn, the residents turned to dairy farming, which has been a mainstay ever since. The first [[1900 United States Census|census]] listing Enumclaw in 1900 put the population at 483 people.\n\nIn the 1890s, the Northern Pacific Railroad rerouted their line through [[Palmer, Washington|Palmer]], a few miles to the east of town. In 1910, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] routed a branch line through Enumclaw.\n\nThe city was incorporated on January 27, 1913. In 1929, a much-anticipated route to [[Eastern Washington]] was opened across the [[Naches Pass|Naches Pass Highway]]. In the 1950s Enumclaw Insurance Group greatly expanded its business and the home office became a major employer in the town.  The company is an [[insurance|insurer]] doing business in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]] and [[Utah]].\n\nIn 2005 the [[Enumclaw horse sex case]] occurred on a farm five miles (8&nbsp;km) northwest of Enumclaw, in unincorporated [[King County, Washington|King County]].<ref name=\"AndersonBarn1\">{{cite news|author=Rick Anderson|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-11-09/news/closing-the-barn-door.php|title=Closing the Barn Door|newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=November 9, 2005|access-date=October 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819144737/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-11-09/news/closing-the-barn-door.php/|archive-date=August 19, 2012|url-status=dead}} \"Tait, a truck driver who lives near the Southeast 444th Street<!--\"Southeast 444th Street, WA\" leads to an unincorporated area--> farm where the death occurred, \"</ref> A Boeing aerospace engineer named Kenneth Pinyan from Gig Harbor died after receiving [[anal sex]] from a horse.<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis, Gerrick. \"[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1347/movie-tracks-man-s-mysterious-death-1.79007 Movie tracks man's mysterious death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117061117/http://www.thelantern.com/2.1347/movie-tracks-man-s-mysterious-death-1.79007 |date=January 17, 2011 }}.\" ''[[The Lantern]]''.
