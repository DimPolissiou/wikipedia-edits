Middle-aged, tall, rather heavily built, one glance at the man revealed his character. Frank as the sun and as friendly, brave to a fault, and as generous, utterly self-forgetful in the face of others' needs, neither the activity of his mind nor the dignity and cheerfulness of his spirit would bow to the worst of days. His soldiership, as displayed in the two past years of campaigning, had won him Lord Cornwallis' special praise - coupled once with an aside: 'When I first knew Gordon, twenty years ago, gay in gay London, who could have guessed how much lay in the man?\u2019<ref>Mayo, Katherine, (1938) ''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F73F591B7489DDAF0894DB405B888FF1D3&scp=1&sq=Asgill&st=cse General Washington's Dilemma]'' London: Jonathan Cape.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1782, a captain of the Monmouth Militia and [[privateer]] named [[Joshua Huddy]] was overwhelmed and captured by Loyalist forces. Huddy was accused of complicity in the death of a Loyalist farmer. Huddy was conveyed to New York City, then under British control, where he was summarily sentenced to be executed by [[William Franklin]], the Loyalist son of [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref name=object>{{cite web|url=https://www.masshist.org/object-of-the-month/objects/general-washington-s-terrible-dilemma-2007-10-01|title=General Washington's terrible dilemma|publisher= Massachusetts Historical Society|accessdate=21 August 2019}}</ref> Huddy was held in [[leg irons]] aboard a prison ship until 12 April 1782, when he was taken ashore and hanged.

Not only did he offer to go to the gallows in Asgill's stead, saying: \u201cI wish to God they would take me in your place; for I am an old worn out trunk of a tree, and have neither wife nor mother to weep for me. But even to that they will not consent; so all that I can undertake to do is, to accompany the unfortunate individual, whoever he may be, to the place of his martyrdom, and to give him every consolation and support while life remains, and to obey his wishes after it is taken away.\u201d Having nobody to mourn his loss, was, of course, a lie - the most honourable of lies, overlooking that he had a mother, a brother and four sisters. But he also laid a detailed plan (with the help of several ladies in [[Chatham, New Jersey]] and no doubt beyond) to 'spirit Asgill away' to escape execution (to which proposal, as Katherine Mayo also reports, Asgill made the noblest of statements, not wishing to break his parole, \"The lot fell to me, I will abide by it\"). But the whole six month affair was the beginning of the end for him and he became increasingly ill during the course of the following year.  It had pained him so greatly so see such a popular young man destined to have his life sacrificed:<ref>Mayo, Katherine, (1938) ''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F73F591B7489DDAF0894DB405B888FF1D3&scp=1&sq=Asgill&st=cse General Washington's Dilemma]'' London: Jonathan Cape.</ref><blockquote>During his final moments he was greatly cheered and comforted by the knowledge that his conduct in the Asgill case had won for him the approval and commendation of the Prince of Wales.<ref>Vanderpoel, Ambrose E., (1921) History of Chatham, New Jersey.

Gordon handed Graham a letter he had received from Lady Asgill (Charles Asgill's mother) in which she expresses her deepest gratitude for all that Gordon had done for her son. In ''Gordons under arms; a biographical muster roll of officers named Gordon in the navies and armies of Britain, Europe, America and the Jacobite risings'' it is said that this letter did not reach New York before he died.<ref name=skelton162/> But in Samuel Graham's Memoirs he recalls that Gordon asked him to thank Lady Asgill for her letter and to apologise to her for being unable to respond.

Middle-aged, tall, rather heavily built, one glance at the man revealed his character. Frank as the sun and as friendly, brave to a fault, and as generous, utterly self-forgetful in the face of others' needs, neither the activity of his mind nor the dignity and cheerfulness of his spirit would bow to the worst of days. His soldiership, as displayed in the two past years of campaigning, had won him Lord Cornwallis' special praise - coupled once with an aside: 'When I first knew Gordon, twenty years ago, gay in gay London, who could have guessed how much lay in the man?\u2019<ref>Mayo, Katherine, (1938) ''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F73F591B7489DDAF0894DB405B888FF1D3&scp=1&sq=Asgill&st=cse General Washington's Dilemma]'' London: Jonathan Cape.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1782, a captain of the Monmouth Militia and [[privateer]] named [[Joshua Huddy]] was overwhelmed and captured by Loyalist forces. Huddy was accused of complicity in the death of a Loyalist farmer. Huddy was conveyed to New York City, then under British control, where he was summarily sentenced to be executed by [[William Franklin]], the Loyalist son of [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref name=object>{{cite web|url=https://www.masshist.org/object-of-the-month/objects/general-washington-s-terrible-dilemma-2007-10-01|title=General Washington's terrible dilemma|publisher= Massachusetts Historical Society|accessdate=21 August 2019}}</ref> Huddy was held in [[leg irons]] aboard a prison ship until 12 April 1782, when he was taken ashore and hanged.

Not only did he offer to go to the gallows in Asgill's stead, saying: \u201cI wish to God they would take me in your place; for I am an old worn out trunk of a tree, and have neither wife nor mother to weep for me. But even to that they will not consent; so all that I can undertake to do is, to accompany the unfortunate individual, whoever he may be, to the place of his martyrdom, and to give him every consolation and support while life remains, and to obey his wishes after it is taken away.\u201d Having nobody to mourn his loss, was, of course, a lie - the most honourable of lies, overlooking that he had a mother, a brother and four sisters. But he also laid a detailed plan (with the help of several ladies in [[Chatham, New Jersey]] and no doubt beyond) to 'spirit Asgill away' to escape execution (to which proposal, as Katherine Mayo also reports, Asgill made the noblest of statements, not wishing to break his parole, \"The lot fell to me, I will abide by it\"). But the whole six month affair was the beginning of the end for him and he became increasingly ill during the course of the following year.  It had pained him so greatly so see such a popular young man destined to have his life sacrificed:<ref>Mayo, Katherine, (1938) ''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F73F591B7489DDAF0894DB405B888FF1D3&scp=1&sq=Asgill&st=cse General Washington's Dilemma]'' London: Jonathan Cape.</ref><blockquote>During his final moments he was greatly cheered and comforted by the knowledge that his conduct in the Asgill case had won for him the approval and commendation of the Prince of Wales.<ref>Vanderpoel, Ambrose E., (1921) History of Chatham, New Jersey.

Gordon handed Graham a letter he had received from Lady Asgill (Charles Asgill's mother) in which she expresses her deepest gratitude for all that Gordon had done for her son. In ''Gordons under arms; a biographical muster roll of officers named Gordon in the navies and armies of Britain, Europe, America and the Jacobite risings'' it is said that this letter did not reach New York before he died.<ref name=skelton162/> But in Samuel Graham's Memoirs he recalls that Gordon asked him to thank Lady Asgill for her letter and to apologise to her for being unable to respond.
