The film stars [[Vincent Price]], [[Nan Grey]] and [[John Sutton (actor)|John Sutton]]. The film is a sequel to the 1933 film ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'', it is the second film in the [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'' film series]]. The film is about Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe (Price) who is condemned for a murder he did not commit, which leads to him to be beg Dr. Frank Griffin (Sutton) to inject him with the invisibility serum despite Griffin's warning that the serum will drive him mad.\n\nFollowing the commercial success of ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', Universal Studios announced the development of ''The Invisible Man Returns'' in March 1939. The film went through a few screenwriters and directors before choosing [[Joe May]] to direct and Lester K. Cole and [[Curt Siodmak]] to write the script. Production went behind schedule early into the production and led to late night filming and production ending in November. The film was released in January 12, 1940. The [[special effects]] by [[John P. Fulton]], [[Bernard B. Brown]] and [[William Hedgcock]] received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]]\n\n==Plot==\nSir Geoffrey Radcliffe ([[Vincent Price]]) is sentenced to death for the murder of his brother Michael, a crime he did not commit.  Dr. Frank Griffin, the brother of the original invisible man (named John instead of Jack), injects the prisoner with an invisibility drug.  As Radcliffe's execution nears, he suddenly vanishes from his cell.  Detective Sampson ([[Cecil Kellaway]]) from the Scotland Yard guesses the truth while Radcliffe searches for the real murderer before the drug causes him to go insane.\n\nThe Radcliffe family owns a mining operation.  The recently promoted employee Willie Spears ([[Alan Napier]]) is promoted within the company, stirring Radcliffe's suspicions.  After forcing Spears' car off the road, Spears is frightened into revealing that Richard Cobb (Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]]), Radcliffe's cousin, is the murderer.  After a confrontation, a chase scene ensues during which Radcliffe is struck by a bullet from Sampson. Cobb is fatally injured by falling from a coal wagon, but confesses to the murder before he dies.\n\nNow cleared of all wrongdoing, Radcliffe, dying from blood loss and exposure, makes his way to Dr. Griffin. A number of Radcliffe's employees volunteer to donate blood to Radcliffe. The transfusion succeeds, making Radcliffe visible again, allowing the doctor to operate and save his life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Richard Cobb\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe\n* [[Nan Grey]] as Helen Manson\n* [[John Sutton (actor)|John Sutton]] as Dr. Frank Griffin\n* [[Cecil Kellaway]] as Inspector Sampson\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Willie Spears\n* [[Forrester Harvey]] as Ben Jenkins\n* [[Paul England (actor)|Paul England]] as Detective\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[Universal Pictures]] first announced the development of ''The Invisible Man Returns'' in March 1939, around the time ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' had found itself doing decently in the box office.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=208}} In May, [[Joe May]] was announced as the director of the film with either [[Boris Karloff]] or [[Bela Lugosi]] hinted at playing the lead.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=208}} Days after this announcement, [[Rowland V.

Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_easternlands/> He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He was intentionally vague about the size of the ''Ice and Fire'' world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/> A new map artist was used in ''A Dance with Dragons'' so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/>\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012 as ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' ({{ISBN|978-0345538543}}). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled \"The Known World\", \"The West\", \"Central Essos\", \"The East\", \"Westeros\", \"Beyond The Wall\", \"The Free Cities\", \"Slaver's Bay\", \"The Dothraki Sea\", \"King's Landing\", \"Braavos\", and \"Journeys\".

The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called \"[[#The North|North]]\" and \"South\" by a [[swamp]]-rich [[isthmus]] called '''the Neck'''.  The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk (being roughly the size of [[Canada]]) of Westeros, but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the [[ice field]] region north and west of a massive [[mountain range]] called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of [[human settlement]]s.<ref group=S name=HBOYouTubeWildlings/><ref group=S name=newyorker/>  The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although it is thought to be continuous with a [[polar ice cap]] north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of one king of the Targaryen dynasty, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history,<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> in particular the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sffworld/>\n\nThe first inhabitants of the continent were the [[Children of the Forest]], a nature-worshipping [[stone age]] anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in [[weirwood]] trees.  Some time later, [[bronze age]] human settlers, known as the First Men, migrated from Essos via a [[land bridge]] at the southeastern end of the continent and gradually spread to the entire continent.  The First Men's attempts at chopping down forests and cultivating the land led to a millennia-long war with the Children of the Forest, that eventually was settled by an agreement known as \"The Pact\".  This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes, during which the First Men adopted the religion of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Old Gods|Old Gods]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran VII, pp. 737\u2013739}}\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}} an enigmatic arctic humanoid species called the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] emerged from the Land of Always Winter, the northernmost part of Westeros, during the decades-long winter known as \"The Long Night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}  The Children of the Forest and the First Men allied to repel the Others, and then built the Wall barring passage from the far north.

The TV adaptation used [[Iceland]] as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada{{snd}} [[Hudson Bay]] or the Canadian forests just north of [[Michigan]]. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into [[tundra]] and [[ice field]]s and it becomes more of an [[arctic]] environment. You have [[plain]]s on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the [[Himalayas]].\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada.<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the [[Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull]] [[Ice calving|calving]] [[glacier]] in [[Skaftafell]], Iceland, followed by shooting near [[Smyrlabj\u00f6rg]] and [[V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal]] on [[H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i]].

It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\n===The Riverlands===\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_strength\"/> areas surrounding the forks of the river [[Trident]] on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale, and the North<ref group=\"S\" name=\"hbo_viewersguide_map\"/> and lacking the natural defenses of other regions,<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Riverrunvmap\"/> they have seen frequent warfare.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Tullyvguide\"/> As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IX, p. 649}}\n\n====Harrenhal====\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black,<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed.<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a [[white elephant]]. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\n====Riverrun====\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of [[Robb Stark]]'s great victory over [[House Lannister]] and the site of his crowning. By the end of the ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', [[Brynden Tully]] surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.\n\n====The Twins====\nThe Twins is the seat of [[House Frey]], which has grown wealthy by charging a toll of all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, theirs is one of the most powerful houses sworn to [[House Tully]]. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre him, his mother, and his army (and in the TV adaptation, his wife): an event known as \"[[The Red Wedding]]\", which violates native customs of [[hospitality#Celtic cultures|guest right]] and incurs enmity throughout the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\n===The Vale of Arryn===\n[[File:Meteore.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, images of the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]] were used for the composite views of the Vale.]]\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====The Eyrie====\n[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The German [[Neuschwanstein Castle|castle of Neuschwanstein]], on which the Eyrie is based]]\nBased on the German castle of [[Neuschwanstein]],<ref group=S name=westeros.orgKepler/> the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant's Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the [[granary]] can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below.  [[Oxen]] are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells\", are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush [[velvet]] curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of ''Feast for Crows'', Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert \"Robin\" Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn's death.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Alayne, Chapter 41}}\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]]. Initially they had been considering the [[Wulingyuan|Zhangjiajie Mountains]] in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option.<ref group=S name=btlnews_bluebolt/> Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"<ref group=S name=aoltv_qa/>\n\n===The Westerlands===\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth.{{cn|date=April 2012}} As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Prologue, p. 12}}\n\n====Casterly Rock====\n[[File:Rock of Gibraltar northwest.jpg|thumb|Casterly Rock was inspired by the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] (pictured).]]\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of [[House Lannister]]. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] before the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] made one of her cousins [[castellan]] of the castle. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref group=S name=grrm_blog_080529/>\n\n===The Reach===\n[[File:Castillo de Almodovar (11801978016).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, which represented Highgarden in ''Game of Thrones'']]\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by [[House Tyrell]] from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven.{{cn|date=April 2012}} Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Oldtown====\n[[File:PHAROS2013-3000x2250.jpg|thumb|The Hightower of Oldtown bears similarities to the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (3D reconstruction pictured)]]\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive [[ziggurat|stepped lighthouse]] which extends some {{convert|800|ft}} into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the [[War of the Five Kings]], but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\n===The Stormlands===\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by [[House Baratheon]], bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Aegon joined the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=S name=westeros.orgStormlands/> Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, p. 161}}\n\n====Storm's End====\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others suggest that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|40|ft}} thick on its thinnest side, nearly {{convert|80|ft}} thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, [[barracks]], [[armory (military)|armory]] and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. [[Stannis Baratheon]], commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of ''A Dance with Dragons'' an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm's End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in [[Larrybane]], Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the [[Cushendun Caves]], also in Northern Ireland.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n===The Crownlands===\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\n====Dragonstone====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Downhill Strand]], [[County Londonderry]] was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone (left) and [[Gaztelugatxe]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain (right) stood in for Dragonstone in Season 7. |image1=Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 222956.jpg |image2=Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg}}\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of [[Valyria]]. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family moved to Dragonstone. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious [[gargoyle]]s to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis felt slighted because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros and condemned the queen's children as bastards born of [[incest]], as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of [[Downhill Strand]].<ref group=S name=utv_beach/> In [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|Season 7]] of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]] of Spain: the islet of [[Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Bermeo]], Itzurun Beach in [[Zumaia]], and Muriola Beach in [[Barrika]].<ref group=S name=TelegraphFilmingLocations/>\n\n====King's Landing====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Mdina]] in Malta (left) and [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia (right) stood in for King's Landing in the TV adaptation. |image1=Mdina, Malta - panoramio (18).jpg |image2=Dubrovnik from walls.JPG}}\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 1 million people, making it the most populous city in Westeros.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, p. 528}} It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the [[royal court]]. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on [[Perpetual stew|\"bowls of brown\"]], a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> It was inspired by the view of [[Staten Island]] from his childhood home in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].<ref group=S name=GRRMInterviewABCNews/>\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital [[Mdina]] to represent King's Landing.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland city{{snd}} so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the [[Mdina Gate|town gate]], which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives. Nearby [[Fort Manoel]] doubled as the great Sept of Baelor,\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> which can be seen when Ned Stark is executed. Various other locations around Malta represent the Red Keep, \"including the real-life residence of the president of Malta, [[San Anton Palace]].

As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, [[Tyrion Lannister]], as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Prince's Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin,<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> Dorne has the highest temperatures of any kingdom in Westeros, and is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including [[equal primogeniture]]. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling [[House Martell]] still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring{{cn|date=April 2012}} and given the surname Sand,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}} as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\nAccording to ''A Storm of Swords'', \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran\u2019s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}}\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], [[Seville, Spain]].\n\n==Summer Sea==\n====Basilisk Isles====\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for [[pirate]]s, [[slave trade|slaver]]s, [[sellsword]]s, and [[outlaw]]s. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\n====Naath====\nNaath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island off the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies west of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme pacifism, making music instead of war and refusing to eat meat, only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys' interpreter [[Missandei]] is from Naath.\n\n====Summer Islands {{anchor|Summer Islands|The Summer Islands}}====\nAs indicated on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'', the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} with a local fauna of talking birds,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 302}} apes,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}} and monkeys.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne III, p. 300}} The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}} They wear colored feathery clothes{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 294}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} and live on fruit and fish.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell V, p. 965}} From their port city named Tall Trees Town,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 121}} spices,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}} feathers,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 8}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Griffin Reborn, p. 801}} People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels ''swan ships'', \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u201375}} Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in ''A Feast for Crows'' aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in ''A Clash of Kings'', the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 238}}\n\n==Essos==\nPart of the narrative in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' lies across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of [[Eurasia]],<ref group=S name=ssm_geography/> Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of [[#Qohor|Qohor]], and extensive island chains such as [[#Braavos|Braavos]] and [[#Lys|Lys]]. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with a coastline along the Summer Sea and [[#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]]. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/>\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of [[House Targaryen]] before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as [[city-states]]. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\n===Free Cities and vicinity {{anchor|The Free Cities|Free Cities|Andalos|Rhoyne}}===\nAcross the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys I, pp. 30\u201331}} the books only provide a map of this region in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the [[#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]], though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria.{{cn|date=June 2012}} An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of [[Valyrian languages|High Valyrian]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}}\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 182}} Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, p. 436}} As mapped in ''A Dance with Dragons'', the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, pp. 187\u2013189}} The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}}\n\n====Braavos====\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon V, p. 447}} in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} Braavos is home to the 'Iron Bank', one of the wealthiest banks in the known world <ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-everything-to-know-about-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-2017-8#what-is-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-1</ref>. Braavos is also known for its swordsmen known as 'bravos'<ref>https://www.ign.com/wikis/game-of-thrones/Braavos</ref>, and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city's power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple{{sfn| ''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Davos, pp. 194}} and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, especially The Crown, which has borrowed millions.\n\nBraavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The city is also renowned worldwide for its [[courtesan]]s. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade. Pugnacious bravos fill the city, frequently dueling to display their skill.\n\nBraavos was inspired by [[Venice]], Italy.<ref group=S name=FrankelBook/> It was filmed in Croatian towns of [[\u0160ibenik]], and [[Ka\u0161tel Gomilica]] in the TV series.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n====Pentos====\n[[File:Palazz Verdala - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The TV series filmed Illyrio's mansion in Pentos at [[Verdala Palace]] in Malta.]]\nPentos is a major trading port on a bay of the western coast. Dominated by an architecture of square brick towers, it is headed by a Prince who is chosen by the de facto rulers of the city, known as Magisters. Khalasars occasionally make their way this far from the Dothraki Sea, but the Pentoshi are spared much of the raiding and invasions by paying tribute to their khals. Men from Pentos wear dyed and forked beards. As in many Free Cities, slavery is outlawed, but the wealthy and powerful members of the city have the ability to flout these laws by keeping servants collared in bronze.\n\nDaenerys's scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in [[Morocco]].<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The television adaptation re-used the Jerusalem sets of ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' near [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco. \"One small portion of the Jerusalem set, redressed and repainted, became the courtyard of Illyrio's manse where Dany first meets Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog10526 /> \"When the pilot was delivered, HBO asked for extensive reshoots, including the scrapping of all the footage shot in a landlocked part of Morocco{{snd}} which was supposed to take place in Pentos, a fictional port city{{snd}} and filming it again in Malta.\"<ref group=S name=nyt/> The exterior scenes at Illyrio's mansion in Pentos were shot at [[Verdala Palace]], the 16th century summer palace of the [[president of Malta]].<ref group=S name=\"Den of Geek 29 February 2012\"/> \"One of Malta's most spectacular natural attractions, the [[Azure Window]] on the island of Gozo, stood in for the location of Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nWhen Pentos reappeared in Season 5, it was filmed in Croatia.\n\n====Volantis====\nVolantis is a port on the southern coast of Essos, and is the oldest and proudest of the Free Cities. A fortification known as the Black Wall protects the oldest parts of the city.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} The city is ruled by three [[triarchy|triarchs]], who are elected every year by free landholders of Volantis, and defended by slave soldiers called the \"Tiger cloaks\". Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of [[R'hllor]] is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], Spain.\n\n====Other Free Cities {{anchor|Lorath|Lys|Myr|Norvos|Qohor|Tyrosh|Volantis}}====\n* '''Lorath''' is a port city on a group of northern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The character [[Jaqen H'ghar]] poses as a Lorathi in ''A Clash of Kings'', wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}}\n* '''Lys''' sits astride a series of southern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Lysene have a tendency to be tall and fair of skin and eyes, unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys.{{cn|date=June 2012}} Dany's handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.\n* '''Myr''' is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate lace, and fine carpets. The dark eyed and dark skinned Myrmen are similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.\n* '''Norvos''' sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large bells, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-stucco villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.\n* '''Qohor''' is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor's city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor's defenders.\n* '''Tyrosh''', a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves and Tyroshi pear brandy. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.\n\n===Central Essos===\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in ''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings'' before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\n==== Valyria ====\nValyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundreds of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\n====Dothraki Sea {{anchor|The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea|Vaes Dothrak}}====\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their [[Dothraki language|own language]] and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal's consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\n\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of [[steppe]] and [[plains cultures]] ... [[Mongols]] and [[Huns]], certainly, but also [[Alans]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and various other [[Amerindian]] tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to [[Arabs]] or [[Turkish people|Turks]] is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [[Turkic peoples|[historic] Turks]] were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/> However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The dosh khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] of northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later [[Computer-generated imagery|C.G.I.ed]] on two pedestals erected on location.<ref group=S name=mogot_swarming/>\n\n====Lhazar====\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=}} The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in [[Malta]], at the farming town of [[Manikata]].<ref group=S name=magot_dothraki/>\n\n===Slaver's Bay {{anchor|Slaver's Bay|Slavers Bay|Slavers' Bay}}===\nSlaver's Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 329\u2013330}} The climate is very hot.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} After a first mention in ''A Game of Thrones'' in relation to slavery,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 667}} Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver's Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen in ''A Storm of Swords''. She stays in Meereen throughout most of ''A Dance with Dragons''.\n\nThe cities were built from the rubble of Old Ghis, an ancient rival of Valyria that was crushed by Valyria thousands of years before the series' events.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 371\u2013373}} The economies of the cities are largely based on slave labor and the slave trade.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} Treatment of slaves is often harsh,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} while citizens live in relative luxury. Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes.

The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]], Morocco in the TV show.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Meereen====\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nFor the [[Game of Thrones|HBO television series]], many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the [[Fortress of Klis]], Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in [[Osuna]], Spain.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n=== Eastern Essos ===\n====Red Waste {{anchor|The Red Waste}}====\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in ''A Clash of Kings'' when Daenerys Targaryen and her ''khalasar'' crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\n====Qarth====\nFirst mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'',{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books.

The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many colors, including rose, violet, and [[umber]]. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of [[Lokrum]] near [[Dubrovnik]] and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nThe Qartheen are described as \"tall pale folk in linen and [[samite]] and tiger fur\", with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} Daenerys perceives them as \"nothing if not polite\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Slaves serve their needs.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The Pureborn, descendants of the city's ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city's defenses.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth's warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called \"the shade of the evening\", are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering \"I am so sorry,\" before killing their victims.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of ''A Clash of Kings''.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 884}}\n\n=== Unvisited lands {{anchor|Other lands|Unvisited lands}} ===\n{{for|Valyria|#Essos{{!}}\u00a7 World and fictional history \u00a7\u00a7 Essos}}\n====Asshai and the Shadow Lands {{anchor|Asshai|The Shadow Lands|Asshai and the Shadow Lands}}====\nAsshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the ''Ice and Fire'' world.

The Dothraki believe that ghost grass covers the Shadow Lands, with stalks that glow in the dark and grow taller than a man on horseback.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 226}} Daenerys heard that \"spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} There are also Westerosi maesters in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} The mages of Asshai teach others their healing powers,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} but also their spells requiring blood sacrifice.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VIII, pp. 707, 710}} Ancient books of Asshai record the Azor Ahai prophecy followed by members of the [[R'hllor]] faith.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}} Daenerys heard that dragons themselves originated from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea, and they possibly still live there.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Bran dreams of flying Dragons in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran III, p. 163}} The petrified dragon eggs Illyrio gives to Daenerys are said to come from the Shadow Lands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, p. 104}} The \"dour and frightening\" Shadow Men cover their bodies in tattoos and wear lacquered wooden masks,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} and the appearance of the Asshai'i is described as dark and solemn.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} The Dothraki believe the Asshai'i to be the spawn of shadows.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 583}} The Asshai'i have a language of their own.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}}\n\n====Ibben====\nIbben is a collection of islands north of Essos in the Bay of Whales. The largest of these islands is Ib, which contains the cities Port of Ibben and Ib Nor. Until the Doom of Valyria, Ibben was ruled by a God-King. Now power is held by the Shadow Council, which is made up of nobles, priests, and wealthy guildsmen. Ibben is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', where Tyrion talks of rumors that mammoths \"roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 122}} In 2002, Martin said the narrative would \"probably not\" take readers to Ibben, which he described as a \"cold, mountainous, [[Iceland]]-sized island\" (i.e. 40,000 [[square miles]]) in the Shivering Sea, with the Port of Ibben as the major city; some Ibbenese also live on smaller islands nearby or in colonies on Essos.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> Ibben is unmapped in the books as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', but similar to Martin's descriptions,<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> the HBO ''Viewer's Guide'' world map gives the island's location as to the north-east of Essos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/> Martin said that due to a large [[whale]] population in the Shivering sea, many of the Ibbenses were [[whaler]]s.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> The Ibbenses are known to chew whale blubber in order to maintain their metabolism in the cold climate. Several characters see Ibbenese whalers and [[Cog (ship)|cogs]] at the ports of King's Landing,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IV, p. 169}} Braavos,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Maidenpool,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne V, p. 521}} Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Jon IX, p. 585}} and the Iron Islands.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} The novels describe the people of Ibben as squat and hairy; Arya even meets an Ibbenese woman with a mustache.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Tyrion and Varys meet foul-smelling Ibbenese, {{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jaime III, p. 296}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} who \"were as fond of axes as they were of each other\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} Arya sees \"a dark brutal axeman from Ib\" in her dreams.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Arya I, p. 51}} The Ibbenese are said to speak with low, raspy voices and to have their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}}\n\n====Yi Ti====\nThe novels repeatedly describe Yi Ti as a city full of wonders, lying in the far east.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys X, p. 799}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys I, p. 192}} As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Yi Ti has not appeared on any maps in the books, but Martin specified that \"Yi Ti is to the south east of Qarth, generally, across the Jade Sea.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_yiti/> The city is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', talking of rumors that \"basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Sailor stories presented in ''A Feast for Crows'' mention that a grey plague has hit Yi Ti.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, pp. 425\u2013426}} The god of the people of Yi Ti is called the Lion of Night.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Daenerys sees people of Yi Ti as bright-eyed men in monkey-tail hats in the markets of Vaes Dothrak.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} Martin is unsure \"to what extent those peoples [like of Yi Ti] will ever enter this present story, however... their lands are very far away.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n====Plains of Jogos Nhai====\nNorth of Yi Ti, the Plain of Jogos Nhai are windswept, with rolling hills. They are dominated by a race of mounted warriors called the Jogos Nhai. The Jogos Nhai live in [[yurt]]s and tents, and are a nomadic people. They are short, squat, and have large heads and small faces. Men and women both have pointed skulls, a result of their custom of binding the heads of newborns. They also ride zorses, a striped mount that can withstand much more than average horse. The Jogos Nhai do not fight between themselves, and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a ''jhat'', or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and ''jhats'' are mostly male. (Paraphrased from ''[[The World of Ice & Fire|The World of Ice and Fire]])''\n\n==Sothoryos {{anchor|Sothoryos|Sothoros|Sothyros}}==\nTo the south of Essos is the continent of Sothoryos{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} (mistakenly spelled Sothoros in early novels).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} Sothoryos is the third continent of the known world, and is vast, plague-ridden, covered in [[jungle]]s, and largely unexplored. It is reported to be as large as Essos and described as a \"land without end\" by Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.  \n\nThe continent is first named on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} The narrative itself first refers to the continent in ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as \"the southern continent, roughly equivalent to [[Africa]], jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_geographicalinformation/> The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in ''A Dance with Dragons'',{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} and [[teak]] from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} A corsair's road runs along the continent's northern coast.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} ''A Dance with Dragons'' refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion X, p. 628}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion XI, p. 756}} Victarion describes some people as \"squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros\",{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} and some people fighting in Daznak's Pit for Daenerys's entertainment in ''A Dance with Dragons'' are described as \"[[brindle]]-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys IX, p. 693}} Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n==Ulthos {{anchor|Ulthos}}==\nThe map collection ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' also shows the north tip of a landmass named \"Ulthos\" to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, \"Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world. Terra incognita and all that.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog121114/>\n\n==References==\n===Secondary sources===\n{{Reflist|group=S|30em|refs=\n   <ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat>{{cite web | url=http://eventhorizon.com/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html | title=Transcript of Chat with George R.

Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_easternlands/> He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He was intentionally vague about the size of the ''Ice and Fire'' world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/> A new map artist was used in ''A Dance with Dragons'' so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/>\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012 as ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' ({{ISBN|978-0345538543}}). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled \"The Known World\", \"The West\", \"Central Essos\", \"The East\", \"Westeros\", \"Beyond The Wall\", \"The Free Cities\", \"Slaver's Bay\", \"The Dothraki Sea\", \"King's Landing\", \"Braavos\", and \"Journeys\".

The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called \"[[#The North|North]]\" and \"South\" by a [[swamp]]-rich [[isthmus]] called '''the Neck'''.  The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk (being roughly the size of [[Canada]]) of Westeros, but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the [[ice field]] region north and west of a massive [[mountain range]] called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of [[human settlement]]s.<ref group=S name=HBOYouTubeWildlings/><ref group=S name=newyorker/>  The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although it is thought to be continuous with a [[polar ice cap]] north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of one king of the Targaryen dynasty, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history,<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> in particular the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sffworld/>\n\nThe first inhabitants of the continent were the [[Children of the Forest]], a nature-worshipping [[stone age]] anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in [[weirwood]] trees.  Some time later, [[bronze age]] human settlers, known as the First Men, migrated from Essos via a [[land bridge]] at the southeastern end of the continent and gradually spread to the entire continent.  The First Men's attempts at chopping down forests and cultivating the land led to a millennia-long war with the Children of the Forest, that eventually was settled by an agreement known as \"The Pact\".  This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes, during which the First Men adopted the religion of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Old Gods|Old Gods]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran VII, pp. 737\u2013739}}\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}} an enigmatic arctic humanoid species called the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] emerged from the Land of Always Winter, the northernmost part of Westeros, during the decades-long winter known as \"The Long Night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}  The Children of the Forest and the First Men allied to repel the Others, and then built the Wall barring passage from the far north.  The region north of the Wall was since collectively known as the land \"Beyond the Wall\", and settled by tribal First Men descendants known as the Wildlings or Free Folks.\n\n{{anchor|Seven Kingdoms|7 Kingdoms|7 kingdoms}}\nSometime later, the [[iron age]] humans from Essos called the Andals invaded Westeros, bring along the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Faith of the Seven|Faith of the Seven]].  One by one, First Men kingdoms south of the Neck fell to the Andals, and only the North remained unconquered.  The Children of the Forest was slaughtered and disappeared from Andal lands.  Over time, seven relatively stable feudal kingdoms were forged across Westeros, although their territories fluctuated over the next few thousand years through constant warfares, and no kingdom remained dominant for long:\n* The [[#The North|Kingdom of the North]], ruled by [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]\n* The [[#The Iron Islands|Kingdom of the Isles]] [[#The Riverlands|and the Rivers]], ruled by House Hoare of [[Harrenhal]]\n* The [[#The Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of Mountain and Vale]], ruled by [[House Arryn]] of [[The Eyrie]]\n* The [[#The Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], ruled by [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]\n* The [[#The Stormlands|Kingdom of the Storm]], ruled by House Durrandon of [[Storm's End]]\n* The [[#The Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]], ruled by House Gardener of [[Highgarden]]\n* The [[#Dorne|Principality of Dorne]], ruled by [[House Martell]] of [[Sunspear]].<ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat/>\n\nThree hundred years before the novels begin, the [[Targaryen]] dragonlord [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and his two [[consanguine marriage|sister-wives]] Visenya and Rhaenys, whose ancestors migrated from [[Valyria]] to [[#Dragonstone|Dragonstone]]{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} a century prior, invaded the Westerosi mainland and landed his army at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the Blackwater Rush.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  The three assembled a temporary [[bastion]] called \"Aegonfort\", which later grew into the a massive capital city known as [[#King's Landing|King's Landing]].{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  Aided by their three formidable [[fire-breathing]] [[dragon]]s, the Targaryen armies subdued six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, wiping out three of the seven ruling houses (Durrandon, Hoare and Gardener).

There are several open pools where heated water collects within the godswood.  The hot spring also prevents the ground from freezing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn II, p. 58}}  The castle has deep [[catacombs]] called \"the crypt\", where bodies of deceased Starks are entombed behind statues in their likeness with a [[direwolf (fictional creature)|direwolf]] at their feet and their swords left in their hands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, pp. 42\u201343}}  The tombs have been used since the old kings of the North, known as the Kings of Winter, were in power.

Looking out over the hills, Martin wondered what a [[centurion|Roman centurion]] from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/> This experience was so profound that a decade later, in 1991, he wanted to \"write a story about the people guarding the end of the world\",<ref group=S name=tiff2/> and ultimately \"the things that come out of the [fictional] north are a good deal more terrifying than [[Scottish people|Scotsmen]] or [[Picts]]\".<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> \n\nMartin adjusted the size, length, and magical nature of the Wall for [[genre fiction|genre]] demands;<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/> [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]]'s chapters describe it as approximately {{convert|300|mi}} long{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VI, p. 520}} and {{convert|700|ft}} high in general, rising up to a perceived {{convert|900|ft}} in spots due to huge foundation blocks.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jon IV, pp. 405\u2013406}} The top is wide enough for a dozen mounted knights to ride abreast (approximately 30&nbsp;ft or 10&nbsp;m),{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}} while the base is so thick that the Wall's gates are more like tunnels through the ice.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Bran III, p. 550}}\n\nThe novels' legends claim that the First Men,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon IX, p. 784}} or more specifically Brandon the Builder with the possible help of children of the forest and giants,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jon V, p. 557}} constructed the Wall some 8,000 years before the events of the series.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, p. 46}}\n\nThe Wall has since been maintained by the Night's Watch to guard the realms of men against the threats from beyond, originally the Others, and later against [[wildling (character)|wildling]] raids.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Samwell II, p. 450}} \n\nA strip of land known as \"the Gift\", now stretching 50 [[league (unit)|leagues]] (about {{convert|150|mi}}) south of the wall, was given to them in [[perpetuity]] thousands of years ago for cultivation.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Bran III, p. 546}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Samwell V, p. 1077}} In ''A Game of Thrones'', out of the nineteen castles built along the wall, only three are still manned:{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}} Castle Black with 600 men, and the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with 200 men each.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 206}} Parts of Castle Black have fallen into ruin.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}}\n\nThe TV series' Castle Black and the Wall were filmed in the abandoned [[Magheramorne#Game of Thrones|Magheramorne]] Quarry near [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]],<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> whereas the scenes shot atop the wall were filmed inside [[Paint Hall Studios]].<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall, and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry as the basis for the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond.

The TV adaptation used [[Iceland]] as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada{{snd}} [[Hudson Bay]] or the Canadian forests just north of [[Michigan]]. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into [[tundra]] and [[ice field]]s and it becomes more of an [[arctic]] environment. You have [[plain]]s on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the [[Himalayas]].\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada.<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the [[Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull]] [[Ice calving|calving]] [[glacier]] in [[Skaftafell]], Iceland, followed by shooting near [[Smyrlabj\u00f6rg]] and [[V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal]] on [[H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i]].

It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\n===The Riverlands===\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_strength\"/> areas surrounding the forks of the river [[Trident]] on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale, and the North<ref group=\"S\" name=\"hbo_viewersguide_map\"/> and lacking the natural defenses of other regions,<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Riverrunvmap\"/> they have seen frequent warfare.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Tullyvguide\"/> As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IX, p. 649}}\n\n====Harrenhal====\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black,<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed.<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a [[white elephant]]. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\n====Riverrun====\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of [[Robb Stark]]'s great victory over [[House Lannister]] and the site of his crowning. By the end of the ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', [[Brynden Tully]] surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.\n\n====The Twins====\nThe Twins is the seat of [[House Frey]], which has grown wealthy by charging a toll of all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, theirs is one of the most powerful houses sworn to [[House Tully]]. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre him, his mother, and his army (and in the TV adaptation, his wife): an event known as \"[[The Red Wedding]]\", which violates native customs of [[hospitality#Celtic cultures|guest right]] and incurs enmity throughout the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\n===The Vale of Arryn===\n[[File:Meteore.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, images of the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]] were used for the composite views of the Vale.]]\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====The Eyrie====\n[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The German [[Neuschwanstein Castle|castle of Neuschwanstein]], on which the Eyrie is based]]\nBased on the German castle of [[Neuschwanstein]],<ref group=S name=westeros.orgKepler/> the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant's Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the [[granary]] can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below.  [[Oxen]] are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells\", are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush [[velvet]] curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of ''Feast for Crows'', Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert \"Robin\" Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn's death.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Alayne, Chapter 41}}\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]]. Initially they had been considering the [[Wulingyuan|Zhangjiajie Mountains]] in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option.<ref group=S name=btlnews_bluebolt/> Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"<ref group=S name=aoltv_qa/>\n\n===The Westerlands===\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly [[gold]], which is the source of their wealth.{{cn|date=April 2012}} As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Prologue, p. 12}}\n\n====Casterly Rock====\n[[File:Rock of Gibraltar northwest.jpg|thumb|Casterly Rock was inspired by the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] (pictured).]]\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of [[House Lannister]]. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] before the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] made one of her cousins [[castellan]] of the castle. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref group=S name=grrm_blog_080529/>\n\n===The Reach===\n[[File:Castillo de Almodovar (11801978016).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, which represented Highgarden in ''Game of Thrones'']]\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by [[House Tyrell]] from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven.{{cn|date=April 2012}} Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Oldtown====\n[[File:PHAROS2013-3000x2250.jpg|thumb|The Hightower of Oldtown bears similarities to the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (3D reconstruction pictured)]]\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive [[ziggurat|stepped lighthouse]] which extends some {{convert|800|ft}} into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the [[War of the Five Kings]], but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\n===The Stormlands===\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by [[House Baratheon]], bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Aegon joined the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=S name=westeros.orgStormlands/> Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, p. 161}}\n\n====Storm's End====\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others suggest that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|40|ft}} thick on its thinnest side, nearly {{convert|80|ft}} thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, [[barracks]], [[armory (military)|armory]] and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. [[Stannis Baratheon]], commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of ''A Dance with Dragons'' an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm's End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in [[Larrybane]], Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the [[Cushendun Caves]], also in Northern Ireland.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n===The Crownlands===\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\n====Dragonstone====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Downhill Strand]], [[County Londonderry]] was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone (left) and [[Gaztelugatxe]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain (right) stood in for Dragonstone in Season 7. |image1=Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 222956.jpg |image2=Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg}}\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of [[Valyria]]. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family moved to Dragonstone. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious [[gargoyle]]s to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis felt slighted because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros and condemned the queen's children as bastards born of [[incest]], as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of [[Downhill Strand]].<ref group=S name=utv_beach/> In [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|Season 7]] of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]] of Spain: the islet of [[Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Bermeo]], Itzurun Beach in [[Zumaia]], and Muriola Beach in [[Barrika]].<ref group=S name=TelegraphFilmingLocations/>\n\n====King's Landing====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Mdina]] in Malta (left) and [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia (right) stood in for King's Landing in the TV adaptation. |image1=Mdina, Malta - panoramio (18).jpg |image2=Dubrovnik from walls.JPG}}\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 1 million people, making it the most populous city in Westeros.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, p. 528}} It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the [[royal court]]. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on [[Perpetual stew|\"bowls of brown\"]], a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> It was inspired by the view of [[Staten Island]] from his childhood home in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].<ref group=S name=GRRMInterviewABCNews/>\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital [[Mdina]] to represent King's Landing.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland city{{snd}} so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the [[Mdina Gate|town gate]], which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives.

As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, [[Tyrion Lannister]], as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Prince's Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin,<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> Dorne has the highest temperatures of any kingdom in Westeros, and is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including [[equal primogeniture]]. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling [[House Martell]] still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring{{cn|date=April 2012}} and given the surname Sand,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}} as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\nAccording to ''A Storm of Swords'', \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran\u2019s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}}\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], [[Seville, Spain]].\n\n==Summer Sea==\n====Basilisk Isles====\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for [[pirate]]s, [[slave trade|slaver]]s, [[sellsword]]s, and [[outlaw]]s. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\n====Naath====\nNaath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island off the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies west of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme [[pacifism]], making music instead of war and refusing to eat [[meat]], only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys' interpreter [[Missandei]] is from Naath.\n\n====Summer Islands {{anchor|Summer Islands|The Summer Islands}}====\nAs indicated on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'', the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} with a local fauna of talking birds,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 302}} [[ape]]s,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}} and [[monkey]]s.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne III, p. 300}} The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}} They wear colored feathery clothes{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 294}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} and live on fruit and fish.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell V, p. 965}} From their port city named Tall Trees Town,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 121}} spices,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}} feathers,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 8}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Griffin Reborn, p. 801}} People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels ''swan ships'', \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u201375}} Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in ''A Feast for Crows'' aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in ''A Clash of Kings'', the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 238}}\n\n==Essos==\nPart of the narrative in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' lies across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of [[Eurasia]],<ref group=S name=ssm_geography/> Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of [[#Qohor|Qohor]], and extensive island chains such as [[#Braavos|Braavos]] and [[#Lys|Lys]]. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with a coastline along the Summer Sea and [[#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]]. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/>\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of [[House Targaryen]] before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as [[city-states]]. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\n===Free Cities and vicinity {{anchor|The Free Cities|Free Cities|Andalos|Rhoyne}}===\nAcross the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys I, pp. 30\u201331}} the books only provide a map of this region in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the [[#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]], though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria.{{cn|date=June 2012}} An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of [[Valyrian languages|High Valyrian]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}}\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 182}} Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, p. 436}} As mapped in ''A Dance with Dragons'', the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, pp. 187\u2013189}} The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}}\n\n====Braavos====\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon V, p. 447}} in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} Braavos is home to the 'Iron Bank', one of the wealthiest banks in the known world <ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-everything-to-know-about-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-2017-8#what-is-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-1</ref>. Braavos is also known for its swordsmen known as 'bravos'<ref>https://www.ign.com/wikis/game-of-thrones/Braavos</ref>, and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city's power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple{{sfn| ''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Davos, pp. 194}} and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, especially The Crown, which has borrowed millions.\n\nBraavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The city is also renowned worldwide for its [[courtesan]]s. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade.

Dominated by an architecture of square brick towers, it is headed by a Prince who is chosen by the de facto rulers of the city, known as Magisters. Khalasars occasionally make their way this far from the Dothraki Sea, but the Pentoshi are spared much of the raiding and invasions by paying tribute to their khals. Men from Pentos wear dyed and forked beards. As in many Free Cities, slavery is outlawed, but the wealthy and powerful members of the city have the ability to flout these laws by keeping servants collared in bronze.\n\nDaenerys's scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in [[Morocco]].<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The television adaptation re-used the Jerusalem sets of ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' near [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco. \"One small portion of the Jerusalem set, redressed and repainted, became the courtyard of Illyrio's manse where Dany first meets Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog10526 /> \"When the pilot was delivered, HBO asked for extensive reshoots, including the scrapping of all the footage shot in a landlocked part of Morocco{{snd}} which was supposed to take place in Pentos, a fictional port city{{snd}} and filming it again in Malta.\"<ref group=S name=nyt/> The exterior scenes at Illyrio's mansion in Pentos were shot at [[Verdala Palace]], the 16th century summer palace of the [[president of Malta]].<ref group=S name=\"Den of Geek 29 February 2012\"/> \"One of Malta's most spectacular natural attractions, the [[Azure Window]] on the island of Gozo, stood in for the location of Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nWhen Pentos reappeared in Season 5, it was filmed in Croatia.\n\n====Volantis====\nVolantis is a port on the southern coast of Essos, and is the oldest and proudest of the Free Cities. A fortification known as the Black Wall protects the oldest parts of the city.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} The city is ruled by three [[triarchy|triarchs]], who are elected every year by free landholders of Volantis, and defended by slave soldiers called the \"Tiger cloaks\". Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of [[R'hllor]] is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], Spain.\n\n====Other Free Cities {{anchor|Lorath|Lys|Myr|Norvos|Qohor|Tyrosh|Volantis}}====\n* '''Lorath''' is a port city on a group of northern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The character [[Jaqen H'ghar]] poses as a Lorathi in ''A Clash of Kings'', wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}}\n* '''Lys''' sits astride a series of southern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Lysene have a tendency to be tall and fair of skin and eyes, unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys.{{cn|date=June 2012}} Dany's handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.\n* '''Myr''' is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate [[lace]], and fine [[carpet]]s. The dark eyed and dark skinned Myrmen are similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.\n* '''Norvos''' sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large [[bell]]s, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-[[stucco]] villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.\n* '''Qohor''' is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor's city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor's defenders.\n* '''Tyrosh''', a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves and Tyroshi pear brandy. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.\n\n===Central Essos===\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in ''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings'' before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\n==== Valyria ====\nValyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of [[volcano]]es rich with [[ore]]. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundreds of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\n====Dothraki Sea {{anchor|The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea|Vaes Dothrak}}====\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their [[Dothraki language|own language]] and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal's consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\n\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of [[steppe]] and [[plains cultures]] ... [[Mongols]] and [[Huns]], certainly, but also [[Alans]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and various other [[Amerindian]] tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to [[Arabs]] or [[Turkish people|Turks]] is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [[Turkic peoples|[historic] Turks]] were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/> However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The dosh khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] of northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later [[Computer-generated imagery|C.G.I.ed]] on two pedestals erected on location.<ref group=S name=mogot_swarming/>\n\n====Lhazar====\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=}} The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in [[Malta]], at the farming town of [[Manikata]].<ref group=S name=magot_dothraki/>\n\n===Slaver's Bay {{anchor|Slaver's Bay|Slavers Bay|Slavers' Bay}}===\nSlaver's Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 329\u2013330}} The climate is very hot.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} After a first mention in ''A Game of Thrones'' in relation to slavery,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 667}} Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver's Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen in ''A Storm of Swords''.

The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes. Their wiry hair was black or a dark red, or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari\".{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 368\u2013369}} Only the freeborn men of Astapor are permitted to wear garments called tokars, whose fringes display their status.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 368\u2013369}} Many Astapori women veil their face for the dust.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} The Astapori are drenched in sweet perfumes.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 368\u2013369}}\n\n====Astapor====\nAstapor lies on the banks of the Worm River, a wide, slow and crooked stream with wooded islands.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 377}} Entering Astapor at the beginning of ''A Storm of Swords'', Daenerys experiences it as an ancient and dilapidated city that has long passed its glory days.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} The city is dominated by its red brick architecture, and Arstan Whitebeard explains to Daenerys that the saying \"Brick and blood built Astapor, ... and brick and blood her people\" refers to the slaves who make the bricks.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} Astapor's stepped pyramids, its fighting pits, streets, the surrounding walls and the Plaza of Pride are all made of red bricks.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} The so-called Plaza of Punishment at Astapor's main gates is even larger than the Plaza of Pride.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 377}}\n\nThe Plaza of Pride, which has a red-brick fountain and a huge bronze harpy statue in its center, serves as an open air slave market and a marshaling area for the Unsullied, elite eunuch spearmen known for discipline and effectiveness.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} Astapor is the only city to sell Unsullied,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, p. 117}} but also sells bed slaves, fieldhands, scribes, craftsmen and tutors.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 368\u2013369}} The Unsullied require a huge investment in both time and money by the Astapori who raise and train them,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} but they earn the most profitable of returns for the Good Masters of Astapor.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The Unsullied wear spiked bronze hats,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, p. 117}} and they obey at all costs, even if it demands their death.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 371\u2013373}} They are given new slave names each day to be reminded of their worthlessness.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} In times of attack, unsold Unsullied are deployed to the massive, crumbling red-brick walls that the Astapori no longer man.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 329\u2013330}}\n\nDaenerys decides to buy all of Astapor's trained and untrained Unsullied, over 8600 in number,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 368\u2013369}} and tells them to kill all adult Astapori slavers and soldiers when she leaves the city.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 381}} She gives the power over Astapor to a council of former slaves led by a healer, a scholar and a priest, and tens of thousands of former slaves join her on her travels to Yunkai.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys IV, pp. 573\u2013574}} A former butcher named Cleon fends off a scheme to have the Good Masters re-established, and was crowned as the King of Astapor in reward.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys VI, pp. 982}}\n\nThe TV show used the coastal town of [[Essaouira]], [[Morocco]] to film scenes in Astapor.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Yunkai====\nThe smallest of the three cities, Yunkai, like Meereen, does not trade in Unsullied but is known for its fighting pits and its pleasure houses, both of which turn out slaves at a brisk pace. The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]], Morocco in the TV show.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Meereen====\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nFor the [[Game of Thrones|HBO television series]], many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the [[Fortress of Klis]], Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in [[Osuna]], Spain.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n=== Eastern Essos ===\n====Red Waste {{anchor|The Red Waste}}====\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in ''A Clash of Kings'' when Daenerys Targaryen and her ''khalasar'' crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\n====Qarth====\nFirst mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'',{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books. However, the HBO ''Viewer's Guide'' world map and the opening titles of the TV series' second season show Qarth located at a strait between the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea in the south-east of Essos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/> Upon Daenerys' first visit to Qarth in ''A Clash of Kings'', the warlock Pyat Pree describes his city as the center of the world and as a gateway of commerce and culture between the east and west, and the north and south. The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many colors, including rose, violet, and [[umber]]. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of [[Lokrum]] near [[Dubrovnik]] and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nThe Qartheen are described as \"tall pale folk in linen and [[samite]] and tiger fur\", with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} Daenerys perceives them as \"nothing if not polite\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Slaves serve their needs.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The Pureborn, descendants of the city's ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city's defenses.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth's warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called \"the shade of the evening\", are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering \"I am so sorry,\" before killing their victims.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of ''A Clash of Kings''.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 884}}\n\n=== Unvisited lands {{anchor|Other lands|Unvisited lands}} ===\n{{for|Valyria|#Essos{{!}}\u00a7 World and fictional history \u00a7\u00a7 Essos}}\n====Asshai and the Shadow Lands {{anchor|Asshai|The Shadow Lands|Asshai and the Shadow Lands}}====\nAsshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the ''Ice and Fire'' world. They are first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones''{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}} and were first mapped in ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'', lying on the far east of the known world. Martin is unsure if the books will ever take the readers to Asshai, but said that readers may learn more through the POV character Melisandre (who originates from Asshai{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}}) or through the memories and mentions of other characters.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/> Jorah Mormont describes Asshai as a port city far to the south of the Dothraki sea, at the end of the known world.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VIII, pp. 707, 710}} Asshai exports such goods as black [[amethyst]]s,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Sansa V, p. 833}} amber and [[obsidian|dragonglass]].{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} At another time, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys of great kingdoms to the east of the Red Waste, and lists Asshai by the Shadow as one of the cities full of wonders there.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys I, p. 192}} According to Martin, all ship travels between Westeros and Asshai go via the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea through the straits at Qarth, and that the common folk still believe the world to be flat.<ref group=S name=ssm_asshaitrade/> However, according to Martin, \"Asshai is not nearly important to trade as Yi Ti, and the rich port cities of Yi Ti (and Leng) and more easily reached via Qarth.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog121031/> Quaithe of the Shadow prophesies Daenerys in Qarth that \"To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east [...] and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\" When Daenerys interprets this to mean she must go to Asshai, Quaithe says she would find the truth there.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 583}}\n\nThere are many tales about the Shadow Lands, though how much truth they hold is unclear. The Dothraki believe that ghost grass covers the Shadow Lands, with stalks that glow in the dark and grow taller than a man on horseback.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 226}} Daenerys heard that \"spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} There are also Westerosi maesters in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} The mages of Asshai teach others their healing powers,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} but also their spells requiring blood sacrifice.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VIII, pp. 707, 710}} Ancient books of Asshai record the Azor Ahai prophecy followed by members of the [[R'hllor]] faith.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}} Daenerys heard that dragons themselves originated from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea, and they possibly still live there.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Bran dreams of flying Dragons in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran III, p. 163}} The petrified dragon eggs Illyrio gives to Daenerys are said to come from the Shadow Lands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, p. 104}} The \"dour and frightening\" Shadow Men cover their bodies in tattoos and wear lacquered wooden masks,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} and the appearance of the Asshai'i is described as dark and solemn.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} The Dothraki believe the Asshai'i to be the spawn of shadows.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 583}} The Asshai'i have a language of their own.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}}\n\n====Ibben====\nIbben is a collection of islands north of Essos in the Bay of Whales. The largest of these islands is Ib, which contains the cities Port of Ibben and Ib Nor. Until the Doom of Valyria, Ibben was ruled by a God-King. Now power is held by the Shadow Council, which is made up of nobles, priests, and wealthy guildsmen. Ibben is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', where Tyrion talks of rumors that [[mammoth]]s \"roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 122}} In 2002, Martin said the narrative would \"probably not\" take readers to Ibben, which he described as a \"cold, mountainous, [[Iceland]]-sized island\" (i.e. 40,000 [[square miles]]) in the Shivering Sea, with the Port of Ibben as the major city; some Ibbenese also live on smaller islands nearby or in colonies on Essos.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> Ibben is unmapped in the books as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', but similar to Martin's descriptions,<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> the HBO ''Viewer's Guide'' world map gives the island's location as to the north-east of Essos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/> Martin said that due to a large [[whale]] population in the Shivering sea, many of the Ibbenses were [[whaler]]s.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> The Ibbenses are known to chew whale blubber in order to maintain their metabolism in the cold climate. Several characters see Ibbenese whalers and [[Cog (ship)|cogs]] at the ports of King's Landing,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IV, p. 169}} Braavos,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Maidenpool,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne V, p. 521}} Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Jon IX, p. 585}} and the Iron Islands.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} The novels describe the people of Ibben as squat and hairy; Arya even meets an Ibbenese woman with a mustache.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Tyrion and Varys meet foul-smelling Ibbenese, {{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jaime III, p. 296}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} who \"were as fond of axes as they were of each other\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} Arya sees \"a dark brutal axeman from Ib\" in her dreams.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Arya I, p. 51}} The Ibbenese are said to speak with low, raspy voices and to have their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}}\n\n====Yi Ti====\nThe novels repeatedly describe Yi Ti as a city full of wonders, lying in the far east.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys X, p. 799}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys I, p. 192}} As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Yi Ti has not appeared on any maps in the books, but Martin specified that \"Yi Ti is to the south east of Qarth, generally, across the Jade Sea.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_yiti/> The city is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', talking of rumors that \"basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Sailor stories presented in ''A Feast for Crows'' mention that a grey plague has hit Yi Ti.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, pp. 425\u2013426}} The god of the people of Yi Ti is called the Lion of Night.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Daenerys sees people of Yi Ti as bright-eyed men in monkey-tail hats in the markets of Vaes Dothrak.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} Martin is unsure \"to what extent those peoples [like of Yi Ti] will ever enter this present story, however... their lands are very far away.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n====Plains of Jogos Nhai====\nNorth of Yi Ti, the Plain of Jogos Nhai are windswept, with rolling hills. They are dominated by a race of mounted warriors called the Jogos Nhai. The Jogos Nhai live in [[yurt]]s and tents, and are a nomadic people. They are short, squat, and have large heads and small faces. Men and women both have pointed skulls, a result of their custom of binding the heads of newborns. They also ride zorses, a striped mount that can withstand much more than average horse. The Jogos Nhai do not fight between themselves, and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a ''jhat'', or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and ''jhats'' are mostly male.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\nIn 2004 Sign language interpretation was launched for the social message given in the end of the episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040201/spectrum/tv.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Television|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna revealed through his YouTube channel that the show had to be cancelled because the high broadcasting charges were bringing him losses, and not due to complaints of children imitating stunts from the show as popularly believed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/mukesh-khanna-on-shaktimaan-why-this-show-off-air|title=14 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926, \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0925\u093e '\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928'|newspaper=[[Amar Ujala]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran for 450 episodes from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005 on [[DD National]].<ref name=\"date\"/> Reruns of the series also aired on   [[STAR Utsav]] and [[Dangal TV]].<ref name=\"archive.org12\">{{cite web|url=http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516180410/http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archivedate=2009-05-16|title=STAR - Programme Guide|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> \n\nRe-edited version of the series premiered on [[Pogo TV]] in 2006, The series was also dubbed in English language for the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/screen-on-off/cid/1275205|title=Screen On & Off|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"archive.org18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185837/http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archivedate=2015-02-18|title=TV Schedule - POGO!

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1.

The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics.

Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short tempered creator.\n\n; Jonk Jonkaa\nJonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\n; Evil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\n\n; Shalaka\nShalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan. She first appears in episode 125 of the series in which she tries to harm Geeta. She is an accomplice of Tamraj Kilvish. She has a sister named Shaliyaa.

She later realises that the cat was her sister, Shaliyaa.\n\n; Teemiraa\nShe was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed.

Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear.

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1. Muladhar Chakra *\n\nThis gives control over the Earth element.\n\nPhysical force like gravitation, gravitational force etc.\n\n*2. Swadhishthan *\n\nWater element control\n\nJalajgraman, living in water, fearlessness etc.\n\n* 3 Manipura Chakra *\n\nFire control\n\nComplete knowledge of yoga, without living water, food or living of air, travel by sky, journey of invisibility, velocity equal to light, knowledge of all languages, knowledge of languages of birds and tree plants\n\nNature control such as climate climatic earthquake, leadership capacity, hypnotism, meditation, removal of all types of rays such as xray vision, medicine as well as knowledge of Ayurveda\n\n* 4. [[Anahata (Heart Chakra)|Anahata Chakra]] *\n\nAir control\n\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, Proximity to Brahma, Trikalagalyta, Doordarshan, Kalnagna, Time Control, such as Time Travel\n\nTelepathy, foreign entry (entering the living or dead body of another)\n\nKnowledge of the action of cosmic intersection, going into different planets, stars, realms, and multiverse, entering 26 dimensions, watching the above-mentioned places from a distance\n\nTo see the invisible, the philosophy of Goddesses, rejuvenation, attracting all, the pace of mind, the meditation and manifestation,\n\nHypnotism\n\n* 5 vishuddh chakra *\n\nSky control\n\nThe establishment of Saraswati, which has knowledge of ancient and modern science\n\nThe ability to betray, curse and boast\nKnowledge of entire texts\nLiterature composition, stream flow discourse,\nSong music and dance art\nTo hold many bodies like yours or different\n\nOn the other hand, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun upon the desire to make the body bigger by the desire.\n\nKnowing the subtle mysteries of the universe,\n\nRevealing any substance from zero, turning one thing into another,\n\nChange of form, philosophy of brahman\n\nEuthanasia (immortality), hypnosis and hipnotism\n\n* 6. Agya chakra *\n\nControl over the whole universe\n\nDevour someone\n\nAwakening of ternate\n\nTo give someone infinite powers, to make their own, to make the unsuccessful success, to remove all types of rays, such as power rays, xray vision, becoming like God, attaining Brahmana\n\n* 7. Sahasrara Chakra *\n\nControl over entire universes (multiverses)\n\nAbility to compose, follow, and destroy the universe\n\nTo be equal to Parabrahma, infinite power, nature is adorned for obedience\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted a different identity as\nPandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined ''KR TV''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPBVkdn6Yc&list|title=shaktimaan 22 12 2010 0002|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup>&nbsp;\u2013 ''When the journalist character Geeta Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.''<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/actor/vaishnavi.htm |title=An Interview with vaishnavi Mahant |publisher=Indiantelevision.com |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== Main enemies ====\n; Jackal and Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy. Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola.

Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}} and in Dutch as {{lang|nl|Brusselaars}}. In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels, they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.\n\nOriginally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained. The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025bl|}} and {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025blwa|}} (for {{lang|fr|bruxellois}}) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fortifications of Brussels|Belgian Revolution|Francization of Brussels|Brussels and the European Union#History|Timeline of Brussels}}\n:''See also: [[:fr:Histoire de Bruxelles|History of Brussels]] (in French)''\n{{Quote box\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| quote = [[File:Armoiries de Vianden 3.svg|20px]] [[County of Leuven]] c. 1000\u20131183<br />\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant.svg|22px|alt]] [[Duchy of Brabant]] 1183\u20131430<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Burgundian Netherlands}} 1430\u20131482<br />\n{{flagicon image|Bandera cruz de Borgo\u00f1a 2.svg}} [[Spanish Netherlands]] 1482\u20131714<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Austrian Netherlands}} 1714\u20131746<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Kingdom of France}} 1746\u20131749<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Austrian Netherlands}} 1749\u20131794<br />\n{{Coat of arms|French First Republic}} 1795\u20131804<br />\n{{Coat of arms|First French Empire}} 1804\u20131815<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Netherlands|text=[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]}} 1815\u20131830<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Belgium|text=[[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]]}} 1830\u2013present\n| align = right\n| width = 24em\n| fontsize = 90%\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels, {{circa|979}}.]]\nThe history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]].

Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[County of Leuven|Count of Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (''Treurenberg'', ''[[Coudenberg]]'' and [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon''/''Zavel'']] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the early 13th century, the first [[Fortifications of Brussels]] were built,<ref>{{cite web |language=nl |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels]}}</ref> and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Traces of these can still be seen, although the ''[[small ring]]'', a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|View of Brussels, {{circa|1610}}|alt=]]\nIn the 15th century, the marriage between heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], produced a new Duke of Brabant of the [[Valois Dynasty|House of Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant was integrated into this composite state, and Brussels flourished as the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Burgundy and Brabant.\n\nPhilip died in 1506, and he was succeeded by his son Charles V who then also became [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] (crowned in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]) and even Holy Roman Emperor at the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519.

This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.\n\n[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]\nIn the 17th century, Brussels was a centre for the [[lace]] industry. In 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings \u2013 a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and the city became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Gustaf Wappers]], 1834]]\nIn 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] began in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]].<ref>Slatin, Sonia. \"Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited\", Journal of Musicological Research 3 (1979), 53\u201354.</ref> The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.\n\nFollowing independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies launched by the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the building of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834 and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Saint-Louis University]] in 1858. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] with [[Mechelen]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2010|p=20}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.molenbeek.irisnet.be/fr/je-visite/histoire/Histoire%20en%20quelques%20mots|title=Histoire en quelques mots \u2014 Fran\u00e7ais|website=molenbeek.irisnet.be|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bruxelles, Place Royale, -Brussels, Belgium--LCCN2001697909.jpg|thumb|[[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]], late 19th century]]\nDuring the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Zenne|Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|hausmannien]]'' style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference.]]\nDuring the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and [[Expo '58]]. During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944.

Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions; the three communities being the other component. Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].\n\nSince the split of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].\n\n===Institutions===\n{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}\n[[File:Parlement r\u00e9gion Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Brussels Parliament building]]|alt=]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking \u2013 parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] (French: {{lang|fr|ordonnances}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|ordonnanties}}), which have equal status as a national legislative act.\n\n19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.\n\n===Agglomeration of Brussels===\nBefore the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=1971072630&table_name=wet|website=Belgi\u00eblex.be|publisher=FOD Justitie|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Brussels Agglomeration had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.\n\nAfter the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.\n\n==French and Flemish communities==\n{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}\n[[File:Communities of Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:\n{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish & French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]\nThe [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire fran\u00e7aise}} or COCOF) and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: {{lang|nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie}} or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nThe French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).<ref>Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.<ref>Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.\n\n===Common Community Commission===\nA bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire commune}}, COCOM, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie}}, GGC) also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers \u2013 not the secretaries of state \u2013 of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.\n\n==International institutions==\nBrussels has, since [[World War II]], become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]], as well as international corporations.

There are five [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]], a [[military hospital]] and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitals.be/|title=Belgian Association of Hospitals|website=www.hospitals.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Brussels}}\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Brussels Airlines Airbus A319 landing at Brussels Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Airlines]] Airbus A319 landing at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]]]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:\n* [[Brussels Airport|Brussels-National Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], {{convert|12|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of the capital;\n* [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located near [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south-west of Brussels;\n* [[Melsbroek Air Base]], located in [[Steenokkerzeel]], is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.\nThe first two are also the main airports of Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brussels.info/airports/|title=Brussels.info \u2013 Brussels Airports|website=www.brussels.info|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Boudin 005.jpg|thumb|''The Saint Catherine Dock'', Eug\u00e8ne Boudin (1871)|left]]\nSince the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the [[port of Brussels]]. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the {{lang|fr|Place Sainte-Catherine|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Katelijneplein|italic=no}}, it lies today to the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called Willebroek Canal), which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels\u2013Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north\u2013south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronqui\u00e8res inclined plane|Ronqui\u00e8res]] and the lifts of [[Str\u00e9py-Bracquegnies]].\n\nThe importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year \u2013 almost 2,000 per day \u2013 which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221507/http://www.port.brussels/en|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Train===\n{{Further|List of railway stations in Belgium}}\n[[File:Gare de Bruxelles-Midi Station Brussel-Zuid.jpg|thumb|left|Main hall of [[Brussels-South railway station]], home to the [[Eurostar]] train service to [[London]]]]\n[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ([[Intercity Express|ICE]] train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured).]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|North]], which are the busiest of the country.<ref name=\":2\"/> Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|accessdate=11 Feb 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212004929/http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (1hr 50min) and [[Frankfurt]] (2hr 57min) by the German [[Intercity Express|ICE]].\n\nThe train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North\u2013South connection]], with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.\n\nThe [[City of Brussels]] has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]] and [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]].

It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.\n\n====Metro====\n[[File:Rame \"Boa\".jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Metro]] carriage at [[Erasmus metro station]]|left]]\nThe [[Brussels Metro]] dates back to 1976,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/brussels/|title=Brussels Metro and Tram Network|work=Railway Technology|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> but underground lines known as ''premetro'' have been serviced by tramways since 1968.

The metro is an important [[Transport in Brussels|means of transport]], connecting with six [[railway station]]s of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Lijn]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] bus stops.\n\n====Trams and buses====\nA comprehensive [[Brussels buses|bus]] and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] covers the region. {{As of|2017}}, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which \u2013 lines T3, T4 and T7 \u2013 qualify as ''[[premetro]]'' lines). The total route length is {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"The network and vehicles\"/> making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"The network and vehicles\"/> Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called Noctis. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/4353 |title=Metro, tram and bus in Brussels |website=City of Brussels |language=en |access-date=27 February 2017|date=2016-10-28 }}</ref>\n\n====Ticketing====\nAn interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will, in the next few years,{{when|date=September 2016}} be augmented by the [[Brussels RER|Brussels RER/GEN]] network, which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.\n\n====Other public transport====\n[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|''[[Villo!]]'' bicycles in Brussels]]Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio, in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by [[Villo!]]. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.\n\n===Road network===\n[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi|Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat]] is one of the city's main streets.|alt=]]\nIn medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north\u2013south (the modern {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogstraat|italic=no}}) and east\u2013west ({{lang|fr|Chauss\u00e9e de Gand|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Gentsesteenweg|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue du March\u00e9 aux Herbes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Grasmarkt|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue de Namur|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Naamsestraat|italic=no}}).

Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as {{lang|fr|Bruxellois}} and in Dutch as {{lang|nl|Brusselaars}}. In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels, they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.\n\nOriginally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained. The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025bl|}} and {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025blwa|}} (for {{lang|fr|bruxellois}}) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fortifications of Brussels|Belgian Revolution|Francization of Brussels|Brussels and the European Union#History|Timeline of Brussels}}\n:''See also: [[:fr:Histoire de Bruxelles|History of Brussels]] (in French)''\n{{Quote box\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| quote = [[File:Armoiries de Vianden 3.svg|20px]] [[County of Leuven]] c. 1000\u20131183<br />\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant.svg|22px|alt]] [[Duchy of Brabant]] 1183\u20131430<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Burgundian Netherlands}} 1430\u20131482<br />\n{{flagicon image|Bandera cruz de Borgo\u00f1a 2.svg}} [[Spanish Netherlands]] 1482\u20131714<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Austrian Netherlands}} 1714\u20131746<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Kingdom of France}} 1746\u20131749<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Austrian Netherlands}} 1749\u20131794<br />\n{{Coat of arms|French First Republic}} 1795\u20131804<br />\n{{Coat of arms|First French Empire}} 1804\u20131815<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Netherlands|text=[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]}} 1815\u20131830<br />\n{{Coat of arms|Belgium|text=[[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]]}} 1830\u2013present\n| align = right\n| width = 24em\n| fontsize = 90%\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels, {{circa|979}}.]]\nThe history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]]. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone Age]], with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[Menhir|standing stones]] (''Plattesteen'' in the [[City of Brussels]] and ''Tomberg'' in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]], for example). During [[late antiquity]], the region was home to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the site of [[Tour & Taxis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_decouverte-majeure-a-bruxelles-des-vestiges-romains-retrouves-sur-le-site-de-tour-et-taxis?id=9048235|title=Bruxelles: des vestiges romains retrouv\u00e9s sur le site de Tour et Taxis|date=6 August 2015|work=RTBF Info|access-date=28 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/news/les-romains-de-tour-et-taxis|title=Les Romains de Tour & Taxis \u2014 Patrimoine \u2013 Erfgoed|website=patrimoine.brussels|language=fr|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> Following the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]].\n\nThe origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref> The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] (located in today's province of [[East Flanders]]) to Saint Gaugericus' chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[County of Leuven|Count of Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (''Treurenberg'', ''[[Coudenberg]]'' and [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon''/''Zavel'']] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the early 13th century, the first [[Fortifications of Brussels]] were built,<ref>{{cite web |language=nl |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels]}}</ref> and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Traces of these can still be seen, although the ''[[small ring]]'', a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|View of Brussels, {{circa|1610}}|alt=]]\nIn the 15th century, the marriage between heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], produced a new Duke of Brabant of the [[Valois Dynasty|House of Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant was integrated into this composite state, and Brussels flourished as the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]]. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Burgundy and Brabant.\n\nPhilip died in 1506, and he was succeeded by his son Charles V who then also became [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] (crowned in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]) and even Holy Roman Emperor at the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519.

This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.\n\n[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]\nIn the 17th century, Brussels was a centre for the [[lace]] industry. In 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings \u2013 a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and the city became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Gustaf Wappers]], 1834]]\nIn 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] began in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie|Royal Theatre of La Monnaie]].<ref>Slatin, Sonia. \"Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited\", Journal of Musicological Research 3 (1979), 53\u201354.</ref> The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.\n\nFollowing independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies launched by the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the building of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834 and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels|Saint-Louis University]] in 1858. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] with [[Mechelen]].{{sfn|Wolmar|2010|p=20}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.molenbeek.irisnet.be/fr/je-visite/histoire/Histoire%20en%20quelques%20mots|title=Histoire en quelques mots \u2014 Fran\u00e7ais|website=molenbeek.irisnet.be|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bruxelles, Place Royale, -Brussels, Belgium--LCCN2001697909.jpg|thumb|[[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale/Koningsplein]], late 19th century]]\nDuring the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Zenne|Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|hausmannien]]'' style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference.]]\nDuring the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and [[Expo '58]]. During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944.

Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions; the three communities being the other component. Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].\n\nSince the split of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].\n\n===Institutions===\n{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}\n[[File:Parlement r\u00e9gion Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Brussels Parliament building]]|alt=]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking \u2013 parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] (French: {{lang|fr|ordonnances}}, Dutch: {{lang|nl|ordonnanties}}), which have equal status as a national legislative act.\n\n19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.\n\n===Agglomeration of Brussels===\nBefore the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=1971072630&table_name=wet|website=Belgi\u00eblex.be|publisher=FOD Justitie|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Brussels Agglomeration had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.\n\nAfter the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.\n\n==French and Flemish communities==\n{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}\n[[File:Communities of Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:\n{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish & French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]\nThe [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire fran\u00e7aise}} or COCOF) and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: {{lang|nl|Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie}} or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nThe French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).<ref>Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.<ref>Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.\n\n===Common Community Commission===\nA bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] (French: {{lang|fr|Commission communautaire commune}}, COCOM, Dutch: {{lang|nl|Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie}}, GGC) also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers \u2013 not the secretaries of state \u2013 of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.\n\n==International institutions==\nBrussels has, since [[World War II]], become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]], as well as international corporations.

There are five [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]], a [[military hospital]] and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitals.be/|title=Belgian Association of Hospitals|website=www.hospitals.be|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Brussels}}\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Brussels Airlines Airbus A319 landing at Brussels Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Airlines]] Airbus A319 landing at [[Brussels Airport]] in [[Zaventem]]]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:\n* [[Brussels Airport|Brussels-National Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], {{convert|12|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} east of the capital;\n* [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located near [[Charleroi]] ([[Wallonia]]), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south-west of Brussels;\n* [[Melsbroek Air Base]], located in [[Steenokkerzeel]], is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.\nThe first two are also the main airports of Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brussels.info/airports/|title=Brussels.info \u2013 Brussels Airports|website=www.brussels.info|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Boudin 005.jpg|thumb|''The Saint Catherine Dock'', Eug\u00e8ne Boudin (1871)|left]]\nSince the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the [[port of Brussels]]. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the {{lang|fr|Place Sainte-Catherine|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Sint-Katelijneplein|italic=no}}, it lies today to the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called Willebroek Canal), which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels\u2013Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north\u2013south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronqui\u00e8res inclined plane|Ronqui\u00e8res]] and the lifts of [[Str\u00e9py-Bracquegnies]].\n\nThe importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year \u2013 almost 2,000 per day \u2013 which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221507/http://www.port.brussels/en|archive-date=4 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Train===\n{{Further|List of railway stations in Belgium}}\n[[File:Gare de Bruxelles-Midi Station Brussel-Zuid.jpg|thumb|left|Main hall of [[Brussels-South railway station]], home to the [[Eurostar]] train service to [[London]]]]\n[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ([[Intercity Express|ICE]] train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured).]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|North]], which are the busiest of the country.<ref name=\":2\"/> Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|accessdate=11 Feb 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212004929/http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (1hr 50min) and [[Frankfurt]] (2hr 57min) by the German [[Intercity Express|ICE]].\n\nThe train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North\u2013South connection]], with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.\n\nThe [[City of Brussels]] has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]] and [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]].

It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.\n\n====Metro====\n[[File:Rame \"Boa\".jpg|thumb|[[Brussels Metro]] carriage at [[Erasmus metro station]]|left]]\nThe [[Brussels Metro]] dates back to 1976,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/brussels/|title=Brussels Metro and Tram Network|work=Railway Technology|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> but underground lines known as ''premetro'' have been serviced by tramways since 1968.

The metro is an important [[Transport in Brussels|means of transport]], connecting with six [[railway station]]s of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Lijn]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] bus stops.\n\n====Trams and buses====\nA comprehensive [[Brussels buses|bus]] and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] covers the region. {{As of|2017}}, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which \u2013 lines T3, T4 and T7 \u2013 qualify as ''[[premetro]]'' lines). The total route length is {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"The network and vehicles\"/> making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning {{convert|445|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"The network and vehicles\"/> Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called Noctis. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/4353 |title=Metro, tram and bus in Brussels |website=City of Brussels |language=en |access-date=27 February 2017|date=2016-10-28 }}</ref>\n\n====Ticketing====\nAn interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will, in the next few years,{{when|date=September 2016}} be augmented by the [[Brussels RER|Brussels RER/GEN]] network, which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.\n\n====Other public transport====\n[[File:VilloStationAlmostFull.jpg|thumb|''[[Villo!]]'' bicycles in Brussels]]Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio, in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by [[Villo!]]. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.\n\n===Road network===\n[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi|Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat]] is one of the city's main streets.|alt=]]\nIn medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north\u2013south (the modern {{lang|fr|Rue Haute|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Hoogstraat|italic=no}}) and east\u2013west ({{lang|fr|Chauss\u00e9e de Gand|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Gentsesteenweg|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue du March\u00e9 aux Herbes|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Grasmarkt|italic=no}}-{{lang|fr|Rue de Namur|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Naamsestraat|italic=no}}).

The EP debuted at number one on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] and yielded two singles: \"VVIP\" and \"What Can I Do\" (Korean: \uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0; Revised Romanization: ''Eojjeolago'').

In 2018, he released his first Korean studio album, the chart-topper ''[[The Great Seungri]]'' and embarked on his [[The Great Seungri (tour)|first world tour]] as a solo artist.\n\nMaking his theatrical debut with the musical ''Sonagi'' in 2008, Seungri went on to star in films such as ''[[19-Nineteen|Nineteen]]'' and ''Why Did You Come to My House?'', both released in 2009. He branched into television with the Japanese drama ''Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo'' (2013) and the South Korean television series [[Angel Eyes (TV series)|''Angel Eyes'']] (2014). In recent years, he's explored other ventures, including opening a dance academy, owning a nightclub and restaurant franchise, founding a record label and investing in other businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, Seungri departed from Big Bang and the entertainment industry and retired after allegations of him supplying prostitutes in 2015; a police investigation is ongoing into the [[Burning Sun scandal]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early beginnings and debut with Big Bang===\n[[File:Seung in Thailand.jpg|thumb|upright|Seungri at the TV show ''Fast Forward'' in [[Thailand]] in December 2007]]\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gwangju]], South Korea, Seungri was noted for his dancing skills growing up,<ref name=\"YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'\">{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'|date=July 7, 2006| publisher= | url =http://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2006070620255845157&type=3| work= Star News| pages = | accessdate = January 22, 2010 }}</ref> with the singer participating in the dance group II Hwa.<ref name=\"Seung Ri\">{{cite news| title=Seung Ri| url=http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| work=Koreanmovie.com| accessdate=January 22, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105165134/http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| archivedate=January 5, 2010| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hoping to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, Seungri appeared in survival program ''Let's Coke Play!

The EP debuted at number one on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] and yielded two singles: \"VVIP\" and \"What Can I Do\" (Korean: \uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0; Revised Romanization: ''Eojjeolago'').

In 2018, he released his first Korean studio album, the chart-topper ''[[The Great Seungri]]'' and embarked on his [[The Great Seungri (tour)|first world tour]] as a solo artist.\n\nMaking his theatrical debut with the musical ''Sonagi'' in 2008, Seungri went on to star in films such as ''[[19-Nineteen|Nineteen]]'' and ''Why Did You Come to My House?'', both released in 2009. He branched into television with the Japanese drama ''Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo'' (2013) and the South Korean television series [[Angel Eyes (TV series)|''Angel Eyes'']] (2014). In recent years, he's explored other ventures, including opening a dance academy, owning a nightclub and restaurant franchise, founding a record label and investing in other businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, Seungri departed from Big Bang and the entertainment industry and retired after allegations of him supplying prostitutes in 2015; a police investigation is ongoing into the [[Burning Sun scandal]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early beginnings and debut with Big Bang===\n[[File:Seung in Thailand.jpg|thumb|upright|Seungri at the TV show ''Fast Forward'' in [[Thailand]] in December 2007]]\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gwangju]], South Korea, Seungri was noted for his dancing skills growing up,<ref name=\"YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'\">{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'|date=July 7, 2006| publisher= | url =http://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2006070620255845157&type=3| work= Star News| pages = | accessdate = January 22, 2010 }}</ref> with the singer participating in the dance group II Hwa.<ref name=\"Seung Ri\">{{cite news| title=Seung Ri| url=http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| work=Koreanmovie.com| accessdate=January 22, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105165134/http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| archivedate=January 5, 2010| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hoping to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, Seungri appeared in survival program ''Let's Coke Play!
