He is best known as the creator of the [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (called ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show'' in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town [[Lake Wobegon]], the setting of many of his books, including ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]] ''and ''[[Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories]]''. Other creations include [[Guy Noir]], a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in ''A Prairie Home Companion'' comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program ''[[The Writer's Almanac]]'', which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.\n\nIn November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for ''A Prairie Home Companion''. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'' to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of ''The Writer's Almanac'' on his website.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/ | title=Writer's Almanac Archives}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:GarrisonKeillor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Keillor in 2010, wearing his signature red shoes]]\n\nKeillor was born in [[Anoka, Minnesota]], the son of Grace Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Denham) and John Philip Keillor.

He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called ''A Prairie Home Entertainment'', on KSJR FM at [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota|Collegeville]]. The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual [[classical music|classical]] fare. During this time he submitted fiction to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, where his first story for that publication, \"Local Family Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared in September 1970.<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|first=J.

When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed ''A Prairie Home Companion''.<ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n\nKeillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MER announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' with live musicians.<ref name=\"Lee\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Keillor to Quit Daily Show, Others Leave KSJN|work=[[Minneapolis Tribune]]|publisher=Star Tribune Media Company LLC|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|date=August 24, 1973|page=14B}}</ref>\n\n''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (''PHC'') debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show is punctuated by spoof commercial spots for [[A Prairie Home Companion#Sponsors|''PHC'' fictitious sponsors]] such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM);<ref>''Garrison Keillor,'' pp. 35, 85. University Press of Mississippi, 1991.</ref> it presents parodic serial melodramas, such as ''The Adventures of [[Guy Noir]], Private Eye'' and ''The Lives of the Cowboys.'' Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show airs from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].\n\nAfter the show's intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called ''The News from Lake Wobegon'', a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's own hometown of [[Anoka, Minnesota]], and on [[Freeport, Minnesota|Freeport]] and other small towns in [[Stearns County, Minnesota]], where he lived in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | first = Garrison | last = Keillor | authorlink = Garrison Keillor | title = In Search of Lake Wobegon | publisher = Viking Studio | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/insearchoflakewo0000keil/page/12 12\u201313] | url = https://archive.org/details/insearchoflakewo0000keil/page/12 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-670-03037-8 }}</ref> [[Lake Wobegon]] is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place \"... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\n\n[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|thumb|left|Keillor with [[Richard Dworsky]] on the 40th anniversary of ''A Prairie Home Companion'']]\nThe original ''PHC'' ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, ''The American Radio Company of the Air'', which had essentially the same format as ''PHC''. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to ''A Prairie Home Companion''; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |title=A Prairie Home Companion |publisher=A Prairie Home Companion |access-date=2016-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115070843/https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |archivedate=November 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn a typical broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Keillor's name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor reads, he gives himself no billing or credit except \"written by [[Cerebellum|Sarah Bellum]],\" a joking reference to his own brain.\n\nKeillor regularly takes the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically features local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show''.) Keillor has produced broadcast performances similar to ''PHC'' but without the \"Prairie Home Companion\" brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonbachfestival.com/pressroom/news/267|title=Oregon Bach Festival pressroom|accessdate=August 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128155233/http://oregonbachfestival.com/pressroom/news/267|archivedate=November 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was also the host of ''[[The Writer's Almanac]],'' from 1993 to 2017, which, like ''PHC'', was produced and distributed by American Public Media.\n{{wikinews|'42-year detour' ends: Garrison Keillor homeward bound}}\nIn a March 2011 interview, Keillor announced that he would be retiring from ''A Prairie Home Companion'' in 2013;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/garrison-keillor-prairie-home-companion-168797|title=Garrison Keillor, 'Prairie Home Companion' Host, to Retire From Radio|accessdate=March 30, 2011|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 17, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318085208/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/garrison-keillor-prairie-home-companion-168797|archivedate=March 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but in a December 2011 interview with the ''Sioux City Journal'', Keillor said: \"The show is going well.

Over the years, Mr. Blue's strongest advice has come down on the side of freedom in our personal lives, freedom from crushing obligation and overwork and family expectations and the freedom to walk our own walk and be who we are. And some of the best letters have been addressed to younger readers trapped in jobs like steel suits, advising them to bust loose and go off and have an adventure. Some of the advisees have written back to inform Mr. Blue that the advice was taken and that the adventure changed their lives. This was gratifying.\n\nSo now I am simply taking my own advice. Cut back on obligations: Promote a certain elegant looseness in life. Simple as that. Winter and spring, I almost capsized from work, and in the summer I had a week in [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Mary's Hospital]] to sit and think, and that's the result. Every dog has his day and I've had mine and given whatever advice was mine to give (and a little more). It was exhilarating to get the chance to be useful, which is always an issue for a writer (What good does fiction do?), and Mr. Blue was a way to be useful. Nothing human is beneath a writer's attention; the basic questions about how to attract a lover and what to do with one once you get one and how to deal with disappointment in marriage are the stuff that fiction is made from, so why not try to speak directly? And so I did.

He is best known as the creator of the [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (MPR) show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (called ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show'' in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town [[Lake Wobegon]], the setting of many of his books, including ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]] ''and ''[[Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories]]''. Other creations include [[Guy Noir]], a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in ''A Prairie Home Companion'' comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program ''[[The Writer's Almanac]]'', which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.\n\nIn November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for ''A Prairie Home Companion''. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'' to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of ''The Writer's Almanac'' on his website.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/ | title=Writer's Almanac Archives}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:GarrisonKeillor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Keillor in 2010, wearing his signature red shoes]]\n\nKeillor was born in [[Anoka, Minnesota]], the son of Grace Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Denham) and John Philip Keillor.

The show is punctuated by spoof commercial spots for [[A Prairie Home Companion#Sponsors|''PHC'' fictitious sponsors]] such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM);<ref>''Garrison Keillor,'' pp. 35, 85.

Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show airs from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].\n\nAfter the show's intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called ''The News from Lake Wobegon'', a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's own hometown of [[Anoka, Minnesota]], and on [[Freeport, Minnesota|Freeport]] and other small towns in [[Stearns County, Minnesota]], where he lived in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book | first = Garrison | last = Keillor | authorlink = Garrison Keillor | title = In Search of Lake Wobegon | publisher = Viking Studio | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/insearchoflakewo0000keil/page/12 12\u201313] | url = https://archive.org/details/insearchoflakewo0000keil/page/12 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-670-03037-8 }}</ref> [[Lake Wobegon]] is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place \"... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\n\n[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|thumb|left|Keillor with [[Richard Dworsky]] on the 40th anniversary of ''A Prairie Home Companion'']]\nThe original ''PHC'' ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, ''The American Radio Company of the Air'', which had essentially the same format as ''PHC''. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to ''A Prairie Home Companion''; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |title=A Prairie Home Companion |publisher=A Prairie Home Companion |access-date=2016-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115070843/https://www.prairiehome.org/about/history |archivedate=November 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn a typical broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Keillor's name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler.

In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as ''Garrison Keillor's Radio Show''.)

And some of the best letters have been addressed to younger readers trapped in jobs like steel suits, advising them to bust loose and go off and have an adventure. Some of the advisees have written back to inform Mr. Blue that the advice was taken and that the adventure changed their lives. This was gratifying.\n\nSo now I am simply taking my own advice. Cut back on obligations: Promote a certain elegant looseness in life. Simple as that. Winter and spring, I almost capsized from work, and in the summer I had a week in [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Mary's Hospital]] to sit and think, and that's the result. Every dog has his day and I've had mine and given whatever advice was mine to give (and a little more). It was exhilarating to get the chance to be useful, which is always an issue for a writer (What good does fiction do?), and Mr. Blue was a way to be useful. Nothing human is beneath a writer's attention; the basic questions about how to attract a lover and what to do with one once you get one and how to deal with disappointment in marriage are the stuff that fiction is made from, so why not try to speak directly?

When the prosecution refuses to let her conduct further tests and fires her, leaving her unable to finish repaying her student loans, she accepts a job offer from David Acosta, a professional assessor for the [[Catholic Church|Church]], to determine whether or not LeRoux's claims are true. At first, Kristen is concerned that he may, in fact, be possessed, as she begins receiving threatening visits from George, an [[incubus]] who taunts her for concealing her sexual attraction towards David. However, when LeRoux reveals personal information that Kristen never told him, she discovers that her therapy file was stolen by a man named Leland Townsend, who she deduces was responsible for convincing LeRoux to act on his murderous impulses and has been coaching him to act possessed. David tells her that \"demons\" are often just an excuse for evil people like Townsend to justify their desire to make others suffer for sheer amusement.

A review of security camera footage appears to show the image of a woman who died an hour before Naomi, which Ben suggests could be the result of digital manipulation. The DA offers to reinstate Kristen on a two year contract, which David agrees to match. However, when she goes to tell the DA, he informs her the offer has been rescinded and that Dr. Townsend has replaced her. Kristen's daughter Laura begins to see George in her dreams, terrifying her mother until she discovers that George is in fact a fictional character and is therefore not real. Based on the video, David determines that the hospital pronounced Naomi dead thirty minutes too early, exposing racist practices that he has Kristen report to a lawyer suing the hospital for malpractice. The image is left unexplained, as the priest overseeing the team's work refuses to discuss it.

Ben and Kristen insist that \"Joe\" is part of a prank being pulled on Duke by hacking his virtual assistant. However, despite Ben's attempts to trace the hack, Joe manages to enter his house and takes control of his father's virtual assistant, taunting his sister until he destroys the device. With Duke beginning to suffer a complete mental breakdown, David locates the disgruntled IT tech who originated the prank, but he swears he had nothing to do with hacking Ben's home. Duke subsequently commits suicide after he receives a mysterious email telling him hell is only half full. Kristen uses a [[deepfake]] of a conversation she had with Townsend to get the judge to overrule him.

During the evaluation, Eric bonds with David, and he takes the opportunity to try and improve Eric's character by encouraging him to ask God for what he wants most in life. Sheryl buys her granddaughters expensive [[augmented reality]] headsets, which include a digital game centered around a mysterious girl, Rose390. The girls steadily become obsessed with the game, which Ben notices. His attempt to remove the game fails, and Rose390 taunts the girls by claiming that their father is dead. Afterwards, Kristen takes the headsets away. Eric begins to show improvement, and asks David to teach him how to draw comics.

Their concerns that Caroline is being tortured and deprived of medical care conflict with the fears of the priests that she will succumb to evil unless the exorcism is properly finished, and both sides argue over what to do. David ultimately cures Caroline by persuading her to reject the demonic influence eating at her soul, instantly returning her to sanity. Ben guest-stars on a paranormal \"ghost-finders\" show, where he exposes the host's use of a potentially lethal chemical projector to fake a ghost sighting. His co-host Vanessa gives him her number afterwards. Townsend meets Sheryl at a restaurant, seducing her by playing on her desire for love.

David is tasked with learning whether Grace is truly speaking the word of God, but his superior pressures him to label her a false prophet and discredit her gift. Dr. Boggs teaches Kristen a simple exercise to let her control her dreams, which allows her to deal with the sudden return of George. Sheryl invites Townsend over for dinner, while Kristen visits David while he is under the influence of hallucinogens. When she returns home and sees Townsend playing with her daughters, she takes him out back and slices his neck open, forcing him to leave while trying to convince her mother not to see him again. David confronts his superior and learns that the prophecies are not of the Church ending, but the world itself.

A team of assessors arrive from the Vatican to question the team about Grace, and provide them with access to the original codex, parts of which Kristen illegally photographs. During her exorcism, a housewife confesses to several murders. As it is unclear if she is truly responsible, Kristen and David are brought in to examine her. David reminds Kristen that since the woman is technically her patient, she is prohibited by confidentiality rules from reporting her to the police unless they can get her to state that she intends to kill again. Kristen uses the patient's own emotional instability to weaken the demon's influence, allowing her to determine that she is not the killer, but rather covering for the real one. When her husband has her arrested, David visits him in secret, chokes him out, and finds evidence that he is the killer. Using the photographs of the codex, the team determines that there is a [[hierarchy]] of demons on Earth, each of whom has a unique mark.

Despite some initial concerns, he decides to continue their relationship. David and Kristen both consume hallucinogenic drugs, causing them to have visions: Kristen witnesses Leon's wife give birth to a [[ghoul]] while David meets Annie Commerce, who Leon explains is a slave ancestor of theirs who died in 1859. The mark turns out to be the brand of the slaveowner who purchased Annie, which Leon rediscovered and chose to reclaim as his own.

Townsend starts preparing Sebastian to act on his hate by instructing him to make threatening gestures towards women and having one of his associates teach him how to handle guns. Caroline's lawyer, Judith Lemonhead, is able to mount a strong case against David by exposing his history of arrests and drug addiction, so Kristen gets Renee to go on the offense by having her and Dr. Boggs argue that the medical care Caroline received after the exorcism was responsible for her deteriorating health. Lemonhead informs the Church that Caroline is ready to settle the case for a reasonable sum. Afterwards, she tries to force David to give into his feelings for her.

The series features an ensemble cast including [[Katja Herbers]], [[Mike Colter]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Kurt Fuller]], Marti Matulis, [[Brooklyn Shuck]], Skylar Gray, Maddy Crocco, Dalya Knapp and [[Christine Lahti]]. In October 2019, CBS renewed the series for a second season.\n\n==Premise==\nA skeptical [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]] allies with a [[Catholic]] seminarian and a contractor to investigate purported supernatural incidents.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Katja Herbers]] as Kristen Bouchard, a [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]] hired by David Acosta to help him distinguish between legitimate instances of demonic possession and insanity. Kristen is not religious and does not believe in demons or the supernatural, but finds her skepticism tested many times as she walks a thin line between what science can explain and what it cannot.\n* [[Mike Colter]] as David Acosta, a former journalist studying to be a Catholic priest. He currently works as an assessor, tasked with investigating and confirming events such as miracles and reports of demons. He also takes [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenics]] to see visions, but he is not sure if they are from God or his own mind.\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Ben Shakir, a contractor who works with David as his technical expert and equipment handler, and in a [[Devil's advocate|devil's advocate]] role to provide a scientific explanation for supernatural phenomena.\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Dr. Kurt Boggs, a [[psychiatrist]] and Kristen's therapist.\n* Marti Matulis as George, an [[incubus]].\n* [[Brooklyn Shuck]] as Lynn Bouchard, Kristen's eldest daughter.\n* Skylar Grey as Lila Bouchard, Kristen's second daughter.\n* Maddy Crocco as Lexis Bouchard, Kristen's third daughter.\n* Dalya Knapp as Laura Bouchard, Kristen's youngest daughter.\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Sheryl Luria, Kristen's supportive, hard-living mother.\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as Dr. Leland Townsend, an expert in the occult who is obsessed with encouraging others to commit evil acts. He has a particular interest in David, stemming from his contempt for those who believe themselves incapable of sin. The episode \"Justice \u00d7 2\" reveals that his real identity is Jake Perry, a former insurance adjuster from [[Des Moines]] under the influence of a demonic force.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=#1C3B47|overall=|title=|titleR=<ref name=\"TFC\"/>|director=|writer=|airdate=|airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/evil/listings/|title=Shows A-Z : ''Evil'' on CBS|website=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>|country=U.S.|viewers=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Genesis 1 \n |DirectedBy      = [[Robert King (writer)|Robert King]]\n |WrittenBy       = Robert King & [[Michelle King]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|26}}\n |Viewers         = 4.56<ref name=\"1.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-september-26-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' adjusts up, 'A Million Little Things' and 'Evil' adjust down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=September 27, 2019|accessdate=September 27, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Dr. Kristen Bouchard, a psychologist primarily employed by the [[Queens, New York|Queens]] DA's office, learns that the defendant in her latest trial, Orson LeRoux, is claiming to be demonically possessed in order to claim an [[insanity defense|insanity plea]]. When the prosecution refuses to let her conduct further tests and fires her, leaving her unable to finish repaying her student loans, she accepts a job offer from David Acosta, a professional assessor for the [[Catholic Church|Church]], to determine whether or not LeRoux's claims are true. At first, Kristen is concerned that he may, in fact, be possessed, as she begins receiving threatening visits from George, an [[incubus]] who taunts her for concealing her sexual attraction towards David. However, when LeRoux reveals personal information that Kristen never told him, she discovers that her therapy file was stolen by a man named Leland Townsend, who she deduces was responsible for convincing LeRoux to act on his murderous impulses and has been coaching him to act possessed. David tells her that \"demons\" are often just an excuse for evil people like Townsend to justify their desire to make others suffer for sheer amusement.

A review of security camera footage appears to show the image of a woman who died an hour before Naomi, which Ben suggests could be the result of digital manipulation. The DA offers to reinstate Kristen on a two year contract, which David agrees to match. However, when she goes to tell the DA, he informs her the offer has been rescinded and that Dr. Townsend has replaced her. Kristen's daughter Laura begins to see George in her dreams, terrifying her mother until she discovers that George is in fact a fictional character and is therefore not real. Based on the video, David determines that the hospital pronounced Naomi dead thirty minutes too early, exposing racist practices that he has Kristen report to a lawyer suing the hospital for malpractice. The image is left unexplained, as the priest overseeing the team's work refuses to discuss it. Later that night, David purchases [[hallucinogens]], which he uses to receive visions from God. \n |LineColor       = 1C3B47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = 3 Stars\n |DirectedBy      = Gloria Muzio\n |WrittenBy       = [[Rockne S.

David is asked to assess the case of Byron Duke ([[John Glover]]), a legendary [[Broadway (theater)|Broadway]] producer who sold his soul to a demon named Joe in return for a promise that he would win a [[Tony Award|Tony]]. Ben and Kristen insist that \"Joe\" is part of a prank being pulled on Duke by hacking his virtual assistant. However, despite Ben's attempts to trace the hack, Joe manages to enter his house and takes control of his father's virtual assistant, taunting his sister until he destroys the device. With Duke beginning to suffer a complete mental breakdown, David locates the disgruntled IT tech who originated the prank, but he swears he had nothing to do with hacking Ben's home. Duke subsequently commits suicide after he receives a mysterious email telling him hell is only half full. Kristen uses a [[deepfake]] of a conversation she had with Townsend to get the judge to overrule him. David is advised to start writing down his visions; this leads to him identifying a puzzle involving the ''[[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|Salvator Mundi]]'' which points to a random area of convergence near New York.\n |LineColor       = 1C3B47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Rose390\n |DirectedBy      = [[Peter Sollett]]\n |WrittenBy       = Davita Scarlett\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n |Viewers         = 3.74<ref name=\"1.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The McCrystal family requests a formal evaluation of their nine-year old son Eric to settle their belief that he is possessed by a demon, while Kristen believes that he is simply exhibiting common psychopathic behavior. During the evaluation, Eric bonds with David, and he takes the opportunity to try and improve Eric's character by encouraging him to ask God for what he wants most in life. Sheryl buys her granddaughters expensive [[augmented reality]] headsets, which include a digital game centered around a mysterious girl, Rose390. The girls steadily become obsessed with the game, which Ben notices. His attempt to remove the game fails, and Rose390 taunts the girls by claiming that their father is dead. Afterwards, Kristen takes the headsets away. Eric begins to show improvement, and asks David to teach him how to draw comics. When David arrives, he discovers Eric trying to drown his infant sister and barely saves her life. An emergency exorcism is approved by the Church, but when the team arrives, they realize that the McCrystals murdered Eric, leaving both David and Kristen with immense guilt for failing to save him.\n |LineColor       = 1C3B47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = October 31\n |DirectedBy      = Tess Malone\n |WrittenBy       = Dewayne Darian Jones\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n |Viewers         = 3.48<ref name=\"1.05\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Kristen and Dr. Boggs are forced to weigh in on the Church's decision to perform an exorcism on Caroline Hopkins, a woman demonstrating signs of [[schizophrenia]] but also elements associated with demonic possession. Their concerns that Caroline is being tortured and deprived of medical care conflict with the fears of the priests that she will succumb to evil unless the exorcism is properly finished, and both sides argue over what to do. David ultimately cures Caroline by persuading her to reject the demonic influence eating at her soul, instantly returning her to sanity. Ben guest-stars on a paranormal \"ghost-finders\" show, where he exposes the host's use of a potentially lethal chemical projector to fake a ghost sighting. His co-host Vanessa gives him her number afterwards. Townsend meets Sheryl at a restaurant, seducing her by playing on her desire for love. While watching her grandchildren for [[Halloween]], a masked guest named Brenda takes advantage of her negligence and takes the kids to a graveyard to torment them with the story of a young girl disfigured by her cruel parents.

David is tasked with learning whether Grace is truly speaking the word of God, but his superior pressures him to label her a false prophet and discredit her gift. Dr. Boggs teaches Kristen a simple exercise to let her control her dreams, which allows her to deal with the sudden return of George. Sheryl invites Townsend over for dinner, while Kristen visits David while he is under the influence of hallucinogens. When she returns home and sees Townsend playing with her daughters, she takes him out back and slices his neck open, forcing him to leave while trying to convince her mother not to see him again. David confronts his superior and learns that the prophecies are not of the Church ending, but the world itself.

A team of assessors arrive from the Vatican to question the team about Grace, and provide them with access to the original codex, parts of which Kristen illegally photographs. During her exorcism, a housewife confesses to several murders. As it is unclear if she is truly responsible, Kristen and David are brought in to examine her. David reminds Kristen that since the woman is technically her patient, she is prohibited by confidentiality rules from reporting her to the police unless they can get her to state that she intends to kill again. Kristen uses the patient's own emotional instability to weaken the demon's influence, allowing her to determine that she is not the killer, but rather covering for the real one. When her husband has her arrested, David visits him in secret, chokes him out, and finds evidence that he is the killer. Using the photographs of the codex, the team determines that there is a [[hierarchy]] of demons on Earth, each of whom has a unique mark.

David learns that his dad has now remarried and is using the mark in all of his paintings, claiming that it gives him a clarity he didn't have before. Ben meets Vanessa for the first time in three weeks and confronts her for not calling back; she explains that her \"sister\", who inhabits the right side of her body, didn't want them to get together. Despite some initial concerns, he decides to continue their relationship. David and Kristen both consume hallucinogenic drugs, causing them to have visions: Kristen witnesses Leon's wife give birth to a [[ghoul]] while David meets Annie Commerce, who Leon explains is a slave ancestor of theirs who died in 1859. The mark turns out to be the brand of the slaveowner who purchased Annie, which Leon rediscovered and chose to reclaim as his own. David is shocked by his father's decision, but accepts that he is allowed to deal with the pain of their family's history in his own way.

A church lawyer, Renee Harris (ReElise Goldsberry), volunteers to defend David, based in part on their previous relationship and because he once dated her sister. Kristen and Andy discover a stray cat in their pantry who clearly hates Kristen. Townsend starts preparing Sebastian to act on his hate by instructing him to make threatening gestures towards women and having one of his associates teach him how to handle guns. Caroline's lawyer, Judith Lemonhead, is able to mount a strong case against David by exposing his history of arrests and drug addiction, so Kristen gets Renee to go on the offense by having her and Dr. Boggs argue that the medical care Caroline received after the exorcism was responsible for her deteriorating health. Lemonhead informs the Church that Caroline is ready to settle the case for a reasonable sum. Afterwards, she tries to force David to give into his feelings for her.

Lexi asks Sheryl for advice on dealing with a bully; Sheryl tells her to hit the girl with a rock and then lie about it when Kristen finds out. Unbeknownst to everyone, Townsend has been secretly instructing Sheryl to undermine her daughter. Someone sends David incriminating photos that expose his relationship with Renee, and so he decides to talk to her. After the melody infects Lila, Ben determines that it has been modified to transmit a secret message to anyone under 16 compelling them to commit suicide. The team confronts Melindaz, who goes to see Townsend, her \"producer\", for help. He tells her to apologize and take down the video, knowing that it will only encourage teenagers to continue sharing it. David goes to confession, and takes a walk outside.

David makes several attempts to worm out from under Bloch's control, but fails each time. He then sees Harlan being escorted away by the spirit of [[Death (personification)|Death]] in a dream, and receives a warning from Grace Ling that he must remember [[Matthew 13]]. The team visits Ghana's old roommate, who gives them a lead: Ghana's online avatar is Rose390. Ben creates his own avatar, posing as Lila Bouchard, and links up with Rose390 while Judy uses tracking equipment to trace Ghana's location and send it to the cops.

After the boy's twin sister mysteriously dies [[in utero]], David arranges an exorcism but Eleanor's baby is born before it can be completed. He and Ben look into RSM Fertility, the clinic that administered Eleanor's [[In-vitro fertilization|IVF]], and discover links to families they had previously worked with.
