Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.

It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to lynchings in Mississippi in 1931, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in 1937, Sumners was asked to speak about anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined, writing, \u201cIt has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching.

Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nIn reference to the 1937 lynchings, an outraged Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram that stated \u201cIf the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment.\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now-infamous lynchings including the sheriffs, writing, \u201cThe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A.

It was seen to be a non-statistical and unscientific report [[Scientific racism|motivated by racism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Takeji Furukawa===\nIn 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal ''Psychological Research''. The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers.<ref name=\"AP\" /> The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the [[chi-squared test]], which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time.<ref>e.g. Masao Omura (Nihon University) in \"\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u3068\u6027\u683c Blood Type and Personality\", Terumitsu Maekawa (Asia University) in \"\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u4eba\u9593\u5b66 Blood Type Humanics\" and so on.</ref>\n\nIn another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the [[Taiwanese aborigines|Formosan]]s in Taiwan and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident:<ref name=\"Nakatani\" /> After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan's invasion of China in 1895]], the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />\n\nThe purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.<ref name = Nakatani>{{cite book | title = Criminals and their Scientists: The History of Criminology in International Perspective (Publications of the German Historical Institute) | first = Peter (Ed.) | last = Becker | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-81012-8 | year = 2006 |author2=Yoji Nakatani | chapter = The Birth of Criminology in Modern Japan | page = 294}}</ref>\n\n===Masahiko Nomi===\n{{Main|Masahiko Nomi}}\nInterest in the theory faded in the 1930s.

Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.\n\n===Controversial statistically significant data===\nHowever, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities\u2014as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.\n\nAnother Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), \u8840\u6db2\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u5dee\u5225\u306e\u7814\u7a76 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.

In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students).<ref name=\"watanabey\">Watanabe, Y.

However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:\n# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;\n# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.\n\n=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===\nThe [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]].

His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident:<ref name=\"Nakatani\" /> After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan's invasion of China in 1895]], the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />\n\nThe purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.<ref name = Nakatani>{{cite book | title = Criminals and their Scientists: The History of Criminology in International Perspective (Publications of the German Historical Institute) | first = Peter (Ed.) | last = Becker | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-81012-8 | year = 2006 |author2=Yoji Nakatani | chapter = The Birth of Criminology in Modern Japan | page = 294}}</ref>\n\n===Masahiko Nomi===\n{{Main|Masahiko Nomi}}\nInterest in the theory faded in the 1930s.

Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.\n\n===Controversial statistically significant data===\nHowever, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities\u2014as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.\n\nAnother Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), \u8840\u6db2\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u5dee\u5225\u306e\u7814\u7a76 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.

Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, 10-2, 77-86. - She extracted 7 traits for each 4 blood types, 28 in total, which were common to three or more \"blood type diagnosis\" books. 20 items of all 28 showed less than 50% penetration (the average is 46.1%).</ref> A Japanese writer, Masayuki Kanazawa, analyzed these blood-typical traits in combination with data from Yamaoka (1999)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\" /> that used the same items of Watanabe's penetration survey.<ref name =\"watanabey\" /> If blood-typical differences are caused by penetration (or their self-recognition), the rate of difference of a trait is proportional to the rate of its penetration. However, Kanazawa was not able to discover any association with blood-type differences and penetration rates.<ref>Masayuki Kanazawa (2014), \u7d71\u8a08\u3067\u308f\u304b\u308b\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u4eba\u9593\u5b66\u5165\u9580 An Introduction to Blood Type Humanics - Understanding by Statistics, Gentosha Runaissance {{ISBN|4779011094}}/9784779011092 pp.16-36</ref> This result raises doubt about the role of beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nMost reports that demonstrated statistical correlation attribute differences to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:\n# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;\n# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.\n\n=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===\nThe [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]]. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed blood-typical stereotypes. As a result, researchers found no meaningful statistical difference.<ref name=\"cramer\" /><ref name=\"rogers\" /><ref name=\"wu\" /><ref name=\"sohyuncho\">So Hyun Cho, Eun Kook M.

It is located on the rivers [[Fintau]] and Ruschwede.\n\n== History ==\nFintel belonged to the [[Bishopric of Verden|Prince-Bishopric of Verden]], established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the [[Principality of Verden]], which was first ruled in [[personal union]] by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712\u20131715) - and from 1715 on by the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] annexed the Principality, before [[First French Empire|France]] annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Principality was restored to the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which - after its upgrade to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in 1814 - incorporated the Principality in a [[real union]] and the Princely territory, including Fintel, became part of the new [[Stade (region)|Stade Region]], established in 1823.\n\n== Politics ==\nFintel is part of the ''[[Samtgemeinde]]'' (\"collective municipality\") [[Fintel (Samtgemeinde)|Fintel]], population about 7,000.\n\n=== Parish council ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
