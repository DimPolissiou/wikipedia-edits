First published in 1995, it was reprinted in 1997. It tells the story of a loving African-American family living in the town of [[Flint, Michigan]], in 1963. When the oldest son (Byron) begins to get into a bit of trouble, the parents decide he should spend the summer and possibly the next school year with Grandma Sands in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The entire family travels there together by car, and during their visit, tragic events take place.\n\nThe book was adapted for [[Hallmark Channel]] in 2013.\n\n==Background and setting==\nThe book takes place from approximately January to October 1963, a turbulent time during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The Watson family is fictional, but the characters are based on members of the author's family, including himself, and many of the events in the first half of the book are based on a farm from the author's childhood and additional personal events. \n\nEvents later in the story center around the historic 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in Birmingham, soon after the [[Birmingham campaign|civil rights protests]] had gained negotiation with white city leaders for integration. KKK members bombed the church on September 15, 1963, killing four girls and injuring many more. In the novel, the incident is depicted as occurring a bit earlier than the historical date, allowing the Watson family to still be on [[summer vacation]] in Birmingham when it took place.\n\nThe bombing was a catalyst for increased activity in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and work on voter registration in Mississippi, during [[Freedom Summer]] of 1964.\n\n==Plot==\nThe novel is a [[First-person narrative|first-person account]] narrated by Kenneth Watson, who lives in [[Flint, Michigan]] with his parents, Daniel and Wilona Watson, his older brother Byron, and younger sister Joetta. The opening chapters establish Kenny as a very bright and shy 4th grader who has difficulty making true friends until Rufus Fry arrives in town from Arkansas. Rufus is also bullied by the students at Clark Elementary for his \"country\" clothes and accent, making Kenny reluctant to befriend him at first, but they are soon inseparable. Kenny is alternatively bullied and protected by his 13 year old brother Byron, whom he calls \"an official teenage juvenile delinquent\". Byron has been retained twice because he often skips school and is still in 6th grade. He invents a series of \"fantastic adventures\" which constantly get him into trouble and include playing with matches in the house and setting things on fire, abusing his parent's credit at the corner grocery store to buy himself treats, and getting a \"[[conk]]\" hairstyle against his parents' orders.\n\nDaniel and Wilona eventually become so frustrated with their inability to \"straighten out\" Byron that they decide to send him to [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to live with Grandma Gloria Sands (Wilona's mother) for at least the summer and possibly an entire year. As soon as the school year concludes, the Watsons ready their car (\"the Brown Bomber\") and embark on a road trip from Flint to Birmingham to deliver Byron to his grandma. Kenny had been looking forward to the \"[[battle royal]]\" between his grandma and Byron, but is disappointed when just a few sharp words from the \"old, old lady\" have Byron speaking respectfully and generally behaving himself, causing Kenny to seek out his own \"adventures\". Grandma Sands warns the children to avoid a particular local [[swimming hole]] because of a dangerous whirlpool, which Kenny misheard as \"Wool Pooh\" due to her thick Alabama accent. Kenny wants to swim there anyway, and is frustrated when Byron and Joetta refuse to go along. Ignoring the warnings of both Grandma Sands and Byron, Kenny jumps into the seemingly tranquil pool and edges deeper and deeper water until the whirlpool catches him and almost pulls him down, but Byron saves him. Remembering his grandmother's words, he imagines that a strange monster he thinks is the mysterious Wool Pooh swam up from below to grab his ankle and pull him under. Byron later insists that there was nothing else in the water, but Kenny is convinced that the Wool Pooh actually exists.\n\nShortly afterwards, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb goes off at a nearby church]] where Joetta is attending [[Sunday school]]. Kenny wanders into the still-smoking church in the immediate aftermath looking for his sister, but instead sees the Wool Pooh in the smoke clinging to a torn girl's shoe that looks like Joetta's. In shock, he walks back to Grandma Sands' house without anyone noticing that he had been at the church, and he's again shocked and confused to find Joetta already there. She claims that it was Kenny who's Gay butt had called her away from the church and led her home, and she does not even know that a bombing had taken place right after she'd left Sunday school.\n\nAs soon as they realize that Joetta is safe, the Watsons decide to immediately return home to Flint, trying to avoid explaining the full implications of what has happened to the children. Kenny is unable to process the events in Birmingham and avoids his family and friends over the ensuing weeks, instead spending many hours hiding behind the sofa. Byron eventually coaxes him out and gets Kenny to talk about what happened, which finally brings a flood of tears from Kenny. Encouraging his little brother to \"keep on stepping\", Byron explains that although the world is not perfect, he has to keep moving on.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Kenneth Bernard \"Kenny\" Watson''' - The main character and narrator of the story, the younger of the two sons of the Watsons.

The fourth [[New York City]] venue to be christened the Winter Garden, it opened on March 10, 1911, with the early [[Jerome Kern]] musical ''[[La Belle Paree]]''.  The show starred [[Al Jolson]] and launched him on his highly successful singing and acting career.  He played the Winter Garden many times after that.\n \nThe Winter Garden was completely remodeled in 1922 by [[Herbert J. Krapp]]. The large stage is wider than those in most Broadway houses, and the [[proscenium]] arch is relatively low. The building is situated unusually on its lot, with the main entrance and marquee, located on Broadway, connected to the 1526-seat Seventh Avenue auditorium via a long hallway, and the rear wall of the stage abutting 50th Street.  When Al Jolson performed there, the Winter Garden had a runway built, going out into the audience, and Jolson would run out  and slide on his knees while singing, and the audience, not used to such dynamic and close-up showmanship from a performer, would go wild.\n\nThe theatre's longest tenant was ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which opened on October 7, 1982 and ran 7,485 performances spanning nearly eighteen years. The auditorium was gutted to accommodate the show's junkyard setting, and, after the show's closing, architect Francesca Russo supervised its restoration, returning it to its 1920s appearance.\n\nIn its early days, the theatre frequently hosted series of [[revue]]s presented under the umbrella titles ''The Passing Show'', ''Artists and Models'', and ''The [[Greenwich Village Follies]]''. Following the 1932 death of [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], the Shuberts acquired the rights to the name and format of his famed ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', and they presented the 1934 and 1936 editions of the Follies featuring performers such as [[Fanny Brice]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], [[Eve Arden]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and [[Buddy Ebsen]]. It served as a [[Warner Bros.]] movie house from 1928 to 1933 and a [[United Artists]] cinema in 1945, but aside from these interruptions has operated as a legitimate theatre since it opened. Due to the size of its auditorium, stage, and backstage facilities, it is a house favored for large musical productions.\n\nIn 1974 [[Liza Minnelli]] appeared at the Winter Garden in a concert run that would win her a [[Tony Award]] for that year, honoring her successful sold-out run. A live album of the concert was released that year, and remastered and reissued in 2012.\n\nIn 2002, under an agreement between the [[Shubert Organization]], which owns the theatre, and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], it was renamed the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre. At the beginning of 2007, the corporation's sponsorship ended and the venue returned to its original name. \n<ref>{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Campbell|title=Winter Garden's Drive Time Ends|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/theater/30gard.html|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Notable productions==\n<div style=\"column-width:30em;-moz-column-width:30em;-webkit-column-width:30em\" >\n*1911: ''[[Vera Violetta]]''\n*1916: ''[[Robinson Crusoe, Jr.]]''\n*1918: ''[[Sinbad (1918 musical)|Sinbad]]''\n*1934: ''[[Life Begins at 8:40]]''\n*1935: ''[[At Home Abroad]]''\n*1936: ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1936]]''\n*1937: ''[[Hooray for What!]]''\n*1938: ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]''\n*1943: ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1943]]''\n*1944: ''[[Mexican Hayride]]''\n*1945: ''[[Marinka (operetta)|Marinka]]''\n*1948: ''[[As the Girls Go]]''\n*1950: ''[[Alive and Kicking (musical)|Alive and Kicking]]''\n*1951: ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'', ''[[Make a Wish (musical)|Make a Wish]]''\n*1952: ''[[My Darlin' Aida]]''\n*1953: ''[[Wonderful Town]]''\n*1954: ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]''\n*1955: ''[[Plain and Fancy]]'', ''[[The Vamp]]''\n*1956: ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'',  ''[[Shangri-La (musical)|Shangri-La]]''\n*1957: ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1957]]''\n*1959: ''[[Saratoga (musical)|Saratoga]]'', ''[[Juno (musical)|Juno]]''\n*1960: ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]''\n*1962: ''[[Carnival!]]'',  ''[[All American (musical)|All American]]''\n*1963: ''[[Tovarich (musical)|Tovarich]]'',  ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''\n*1964: ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''\n*1966: ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]''\n*1969: ''[[Jimmy!

The auditorium was gutted to accommodate the show's junkyard setting, and, after the show's closing, architect Francesca Russo supervised its restoration, returning it to its 1920s appearance.\n\nIn its early days, the theatre frequently hosted series of [[revue]]s presented under the umbrella titles ''The Passing Show'', ''Artists and Models'', and ''The [[Greenwich Village Follies]]''. Following the 1932 death of [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], the Shuberts acquired the rights to the name and format of his famed ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', and they presented the 1934 and 1936 editions of the Follies featuring performers such as [[Fanny Brice]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], [[Eve Arden]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and [[Buddy Ebsen]]. It served as a [[Warner Bros.]] movie house from 1928 to 1933 and a [[United Artists]] cinema in 1945, but aside from these interruptions has operated as a legitimate theatre since it opened. Due to the size of its auditorium, stage, and backstage facilities, it is a house favored for large musical productions.\n\nIn 1974 [[Liza Minnelli]] appeared at the Winter Garden in a concert run that would win her a [[Tony Award]] for that year, honoring her successful sold-out run. A live album of the concert was released that year, and remastered and reissued in 2012.\n\nIn 2002, under an agreement between the [[Shubert Organization]], which owns the theatre, and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], it was renamed the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre. At the beginning of 2007, the corporation's sponsorship ended and the venue returned to its original name. \n<ref>{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Campbell|title=Winter Garden's Drive Time Ends|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/theater/30gard.html|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Notable productions==\n<div style=\"column-width:30em;-moz-column-width:30em;-webkit-column-width:30em\" >\n*1911: ''[[Vera Violetta]]''\n*1916: ''[[Robinson Crusoe, Jr.]]''\n*1918: ''[[Sinbad (1918 musical)|Sinbad]]''\n*1934: ''[[Life Begins at 8:40]]''\n*1935: ''[[At Home Abroad]]''\n*1936: ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1936]]''\n*1937: ''[[Hooray for What!]]''\n*1938: ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]''\n*1943: ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1943]]''\n*1944: ''[[Mexican Hayride]]''\n*1945: ''[[Marinka (operetta)|Marinka]]''\n*1948: ''[[As the Girls Go]]''\n*1950: ''[[Alive and Kicking (musical)|Alive and Kicking]]''\n*1951: ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'', ''[[Make a Wish (musical)|Make a Wish]]''\n*1952: ''[[My Darlin' Aida]]''\n*1953: ''[[Wonderful Town]]''\n*1954: ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]''\n*1955: ''[[Plain and Fancy]]'', ''[[The Vamp]]''\n*1956: ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]'',  ''[[Shangri-La (musical)|Shangri-La]]''\n*1957: ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1957]]''\n*1959: ''[[Saratoga (musical)|Saratoga]]'', ''[[Juno (musical)|Juno]]''\n*1960: ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]''\n*1962: ''[[Carnival!]]'',  ''[[All American (musical)|All American]]''\n*1963: ''[[Tovarich (musical)|Tovarich]]'',  ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''\n*1964: ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''\n*1966: ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]''\n*1969: ''[[Jimmy!
