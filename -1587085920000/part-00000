In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n! Unround ||Round\n!Round\n|- \n! align=\"left\" | [[Close vowel|Close]] (High)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|i}} <nowiki><i></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|y}} <nowiki><u></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | \n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|e}} <e>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u00f8}} <\u00f6>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|o}} <o>\n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Open vowel|Open]] (Low)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|a}} <a>\n| align=\"center\" | \n| align=\"center\" | \n|}\nVowel nasalisation occurs on diphthongs only; the few which are not nasalised all end in /i/.\n\n==== Vowel Alternations <ref name=\":0\" />====\n\n* [i] alternates with [\u026a] in unstressed syllables if the vowel in the vowel in the following syllable is [i]. E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories are stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare, /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold, for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories are stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, xi\u02bc nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi\u02bc) and non-xi\u02bc nouns. Xi\u02bc nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's proposal of marriage. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the magical spirits and the people. With peace restored between Arendelle and the Northuldra, Elsa steps down as Queen in order to become the protector of the Enchanted Forest. Anna is crowned as her successor, and Elsa promises to visit regularly.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's proposal of marriage. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the magical spirits and the people. With peace restored between Arendelle and the Northuldra, Elsa steps down as Queen in order to become the protector of the Enchanted Forest. Anna is crowned as her successor, and Elsa promises to visit regularly.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

During his studies at Cambridge, Jacobi played many parts including ''[[Hamlet]]'', which was taken on a tour to Switzerland, where he met [[Richard Burton]]. As a result of his performance of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' at Cambridge, Jacobi was invited to become a member of the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] immediately upon his graduation in 1960.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work===\nJacobi's talent was recognised by [[Laurence Olivier]], who invited the young actor back to London to become one of the founding members of the new [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], even though at the time Jacobi was relatively unknown. He played [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] in the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre's]] inaugural production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' opposite [[Peter O'Toole]] in 1963. Olivier cast him as [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]] in the successful National Theatre stage production of ''[[Othello]]'', a role that Jacobi repeated in the [[Othello (1965 British film)|1965 film version]]. He played Andrei in the NT production and film of ''[[Three Sisters (1970 Olivier film)|Three Sisters]]'' (1970), both featuring Olivier. On 27 July 1965, Jacobi played Brindsley Miller in the first production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy]]''. It was presented by the National Theatre at Chichester and subsequently in London.\n\nAfter eight years at the National Theatre, Jacobi left in 1971 to pursue different roles. In 1972, he starred in the [[BBC]] serial ''Man of Straw'', an adaptation of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s book ''[[Der Untertan]]'', directed by [[Herbert Wise]]. Most of his theatrical work in the 1970s was with the touring classical [[Prospect Theatre Company]], with which he undertook many roles, including ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' and ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' opposite [[Dorothy Tutin]] (1976).\n\nJacobi was increasingly busy with stage and screen acting, but his big breakthrough came in 1976 when he played the title role in the BBC's series ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''. He cemented his reputation with his performance as the stammering, twitching [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], winning much praise. In 1979, thanks to his international popularity, he took ''[[Hamlet]]'' on a theatrical world tour through England, [[Egypt]], Greece, Sweden, Australia, Japan and China, playing [[Prince Hamlet]]. He was invited to perform the role at [[Kronborg|Kronborg Castle]], Denmark, known as Elsinore Castle, the setting of the play. In 1978, he appeared in the [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] production of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', with Sir [[John Gielgud]] and Dame [[Wendy Hiller]].\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1980, Jacobi took the leading role in the BBC's ''[[Hamlet]]'', made his Broadway debut in ''[[The Suicide (play)|The Suicide]]'' (a run shortened by Jacobi's return home to England due to the death of his mother), and joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC). From 1982 to 1985, he played four demanding roles simultaneously: Benedick in Shakespeare's ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', for which he won a Tony for its Broadway run (1984\u20131985); Prospero in ''[[The Tempest]]''; ''[[Peer Gynt]]''; and ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which he brought to the US and played in repertory with ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' on Broadway and in Washington DC (1984\u20131985). In 1986, he made his West End debut in ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' by [[Hugh Whitemore]], starring in the role of [[Alan Turing]], which was written with Jacobi specifically in mind. The play was taken to Broadway. In 1988, Jacobi alternated in West End the title roles of Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' in repertoire.\n\nHe appeared in the television dramas ''[[Inside the Third Reich (film)|Inside the Third Reich]]'' (1982), where he played [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]; ''[[Mr Pye]]'' (1985); and ''[[Little Dorrit (1987 film)|Little Dorrit]]'' (1987), based on [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel; ''[[The Tenth Man (1988 film)|The Tenth Man]]'' (1988) with [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]. In 1982, he lent his voice to the character of Nicodemus in the animated film, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. In 1990, he starred as [[Daedalus]] in episode 4 of ''[[Jim Henson's The Storyteller: Greek Myths]]''.\n\nJacobi continued to play Shakespeare roles, notably in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s 1989 film of ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' (as [[Greek chorus|the Chorus]]), and made his directing debut as Branagh's director for the 1988 [[Renaissance Theatre Company]]'s touring production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', which also played at [[Helsing\u00f8r|Elsinore]] and as part of a Renaissance repertory season at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in London. The 1990s saw Jacobi keeping on with repertoire stage work in ''Kean'' at the [[Old Vic]], ''[[Becket]]'' in the West End (the [[Haymarket Theatre]]) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' at the RSC in both London and [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]]. In 1993 Jacobi voiced Mr Jeremy Fisher in ''[[The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends]]''.\n\nHe was appointed the joint [[artistic director]] of the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]], with the West End impresario Duncan Weldon in 1995 for a three-year tenure. As an actor at Chichester he also starred in four plays, including his first ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' in 1996 (he played it again in 2000, bringing the [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] play to Broadway for a limited run). Jacobi's work during the 1990s included the 13-episode series TV adaptation of the novels by [[Edith Pargeter|Ellis Peters]], ''[[Cadfael (TV series)|Cadfael]]'' (1994\u20131998) and a televised version of ''Breaking the Code'' (1996). Film appearances of the era included performances in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Dead Again]]'' (1991), Branagh's full-text rendition of ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1996) as [[King Claudius]], [[John Maybury]]'s ''[[Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon|Love is the Devil]]'' (1998), a portrait of painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], as Senator Gracchus in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) with [[Russell Crowe]], and as \"The Duke\" opposite [[Christopher Eccleston]] and [[Eddie Izzard]] in a post-[[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] version of [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2001, Jacobi won an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite news| first=Duncan| last=Campbell| title=TV stars dress down for the Emmy awards| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/06/broadcasting.internationalnews| work=[[The Guardian]]| location=| date=6 November 2001| accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> by mocking his Shakespearean background in the television sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'' episode \"[[Frasier (season 8)|The Show Must Go Off]]\", in which he played the world's ''worst'' Shakespearean actor: the hammy, loud, untalented Jackson Hedley. This was his first guest appearance on an American television programme.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nJacobi has narrated audio book versions of the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' by [[C.

In the same year, he also appeared in ''[[Deadline (audio drama)|Deadline]]'', an audio drama also based on ''Doctor Who''. Therein he played Martin Bannister, an ageing writer who makes up stories about \"the Doctor\", a character who travels in time and space, the premise being that the series had never made it on to television. Jacobi later followed this up with an appearance in the ''Doctor Who'' episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\" (June 2007); he appears as the kindly Professor Yana, who by the end of the episode is revealed to actually be the Master. Jacobi admitted to ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' he had always wanted to be on the show: \"One of my ambitions since the '60s has been to take part in a ''Doctor Who''. The other one is ''[[Coronation Street]]''. So I've cracked ''Doctor Who'' now.

In his teens he went to Leyton County High School for Boys, now known as the [[Leyton Sixth Form College]], and became an integral part of the drama club, The Players of [[Leyton]].\n\nWhile in the [[sixth form]], he starred in a production of ''[[Hamlet]],'' which was taken to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and very well regarded.<ref>{{cite news| last=Wheatley| first=Jane| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5356211.ece| title=First knight of nerves for Derek Jacobi and A Bunch of Amateurs| work=The Times| date=18 December 2008}}</ref> At 18 he won a scholarship to the [[University of Cambridge]], where he read history at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and earned his degree.

During his studies at Cambridge, Jacobi played many parts including ''[[Hamlet]]'', which was taken on a tour to Switzerland, where he met [[Richard Burton]]. As a result of his performance of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' at Cambridge, Jacobi was invited to become a member of the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] immediately upon his graduation in 1960.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work===\nJacobi's talent was recognised by [[Laurence Olivier]], who invited the young actor back to London to become one of the founding members of the new [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], even though at the time Jacobi was relatively unknown. He played [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] in the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre's]] inaugural production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' opposite [[Peter O'Toole]] in 1963. Olivier cast him as [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]] in the successful National Theatre stage production of ''[[Othello]]'', a role that Jacobi repeated in the [[Othello (1965 British film)|1965 film version]]. He played Andrei in the NT production and film of ''[[Three Sisters (1970 Olivier film)|Three Sisters]]'' (1970), both featuring Olivier. On 27 July 1965, Jacobi played Brindsley Miller in the first production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Black Comedy]]''. It was presented by the National Theatre at Chichester and subsequently in London.\n\nAfter eight years at the National Theatre, Jacobi left in 1971 to pursue different roles. In 1972, he starred in the [[BBC]] serial ''Man of Straw'', an adaptation of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s book ''[[Der Untertan]]'', directed by [[Herbert Wise]]. Most of his theatrical work in the 1970s was with the touring classical [[Prospect Theatre Company]], with which he undertook many roles, including ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' and ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' opposite [[Dorothy Tutin]] (1976).\n\nJacobi was increasingly busy with stage and screen acting, but his big breakthrough came in 1976 when he played the title role in the BBC's series ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''. He cemented his reputation with his performance as the stammering, twitching [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], winning much praise. In 1979, thanks to his international popularity, he took ''[[Hamlet]]'' on a theatrical world tour through England, [[Egypt]], Greece, Sweden, Australia, Japan and China, playing [[Prince Hamlet]]. He was invited to perform the role at [[Kronborg|Kronborg Castle]], Denmark, known as Elsinore Castle, the setting of the play. In 1978, he appeared in the [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] production of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', with Sir [[John Gielgud]] and Dame [[Wendy Hiller]].\n\n===Later career===\nIn 1980, Jacobi took the leading role in the BBC's ''[[Hamlet]]'', made his Broadway debut in ''[[The Suicide (play)|The Suicide]]'' (a run shortened by Jacobi's return home to England due to the death of his mother), and joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC). From 1982 to 1985, he played four demanding roles simultaneously: Benedick in Shakespeare's ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', for which he won a Tony for its Broadway run (1984\u20131985); Prospero in ''[[The Tempest]]''; ''[[Peer Gynt]]''; and ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which he brought to the US and played in repertory with ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' on Broadway and in Washington DC (1984\u20131985). In 1986, he made his West End debut in ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' by [[Hugh Whitemore]], starring in the role of [[Alan Turing]], which was written with Jacobi specifically in mind. The play was taken to Broadway. In 1988, Jacobi alternated in West End the title roles of Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' in repertoire.\n\nHe appeared in the television dramas ''[[Inside the Third Reich (film)|Inside the Third Reich]]'' (1982), where he played [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]; ''[[Mr Pye]]'' (1985); and ''[[Little Dorrit (1987 film)|Little Dorrit]]'' (1987), based on [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel; ''[[The Tenth Man (1988 film)|The Tenth Man]]'' (1988) with [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]. In 1982, he lent his voice to the character of Nicodemus in the animated film, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. In 1990, he starred as [[Daedalus]] in episode 4 of ''[[Jim Henson's The Storyteller: Greek Myths]]''.\n\nJacobi continued to play Shakespeare roles, notably in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s 1989 film of ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' (as [[Greek chorus|the Chorus]]), and made his directing debut as Branagh's director for the 1988 [[Renaissance Theatre Company]]'s touring production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', which also played at [[Helsing\u00f8r|Elsinore]] and as part of a Renaissance repertory season at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in London. The 1990s saw Jacobi keeping on with repertoire stage work in ''Kean'' at the [[Old Vic]], ''[[Becket]]'' in the West End (the [[Haymarket Theatre]]) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' at the RSC in both London and [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]]. In 1993 Jacobi voiced Mr Jeremy Fisher in ''[[The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends]]''.\n\nHe was appointed the joint [[artistic director]] of the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]], with the West End impresario Duncan Weldon in 1995 for a three-year tenure.

By binding specifically to surface structures on an infectious particle, neutralizing antibodies prevent it from interacting with its [[Host (biology) |host cells]] it might infect and destroy. \n\n==Mechanism==\nIn order to enter cells, virus particles and intracellular bacteria use molecules on their surfaces to interact with the [[cell surface receptor]]s of their target cell which allows them to enter the cell and start their [[Viral replication |replication cycle]].<ref name=\"PoV1\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Volume 1: Molecular Biology |date=2015 |publisher=ASM Press |isbn=978-1555819330 |page=31 |edition=4th}}</ref>\nNeutralising antibodies can inhibit the infectivity by binding to the pathogen and block the molecules needed for cell entry. This can either be due to the antibodies statically interfering with the pathogens attaching to host cell receptors or prevent particles from undergoing structural changes often needed for successful cell entry.\nNeutralising antibodies are also important in neutralizing the toxic effects of bacterial toxins. An example of a neutralizing antibody is [[diphtheria antitoxin]], which can neutralize the biological effects of [[diphtheria toxin]].<ref name=\"Path-1\">{{cite web|last=Treffers|first=Henry P.|date=2014|title=Neutralizing antibody|url= https://www.accessscience.com/content/neutralizing-antibody/450600|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.450600|work=AccessScience|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}</ref> \nThe pathogen-antibody complex is eventually taken up and degraded by macrophages.<ref name=\"PoV2\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Volume 2: Pathogenesis and Control |date=2015 |publisher=ASM Press |isbn=978-1-555-81951-4 |page=125 |edition=4th }}</ref>\nNeutralizing antibodies are not effective against extracellular bacteria, as the binding of antibodies does not prevent bacteria from replicating.

Nonneutralizing antibodies, or binding antibodies, bind specifically to the pathogen, but do not interfere with their infectivity, because they might not bind at the right place. They can be important to flag the particle for [[immune cells]], signaling that this antigen has been targeted, after which the antigen is processed and consequently destroyed by recruited immune cells.<ref name=\"schmaljohn2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Schmaljohn |first1=AL |title=Protective antiviral antibodies that lack neutralizing activity: precedents and evolution of concepts. |journal=Current HIV Research |date=July 2013 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=345\u201353 |doi=10.2174/1570162x113116660057 |pmid=24191933}}</ref>\nNeutralizing antibodies on the other hand can neutralize the biological effects of the antigen  without a need for immune cells.\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|B cell}}\n\nAntibodies are produced and secreted by [[B cell]]s. When B cells are produced in the [[bone marrow]], the genes that encode the antibodies undergo random [[genetic recombination]] ([[V(D)J recombination]]) which results in every mature B cell producing antibodies that differ in their [[amino acid]] sequence in the [[Fragment antigen-binding|antigen-binding region]], such that every B cell produces antibodies that able to bind to a different [[antigen]]s on the surface of pathogens.<ref name=\"Jung2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Jung |first1=David |last2=Alt |first2=Frederick W |title=Unraveling V(D)J Recombination |journal=Cell |date=January 2004 |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013311 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00039-X|pmid=14744439 }}</ref>  A strong diversity in the antibody repertoire allows the immune system to recognise a plethora of pathogens which can come in all different forms and sizes. \nDuring an infection only antibodies that bind to the pathogen with high affinity are produced. This is achieved by [[clonal selection]] of a single B cell clone: \nB cells are recruited to the site of infection by sensing [[interferon]]s that are released by the infected cells as part of the [[Innate immune system |innate immune response]]. B cells display [[B-cell receptor]]s on their cell surface, which is just the antibody anchored to the cell membrane. When the B-cell receptor binds to its cognate antigen with high affinity, an intracellular [[Cell signaling|signalling cascade]] is triggered. \nIn addition to binding to an antigen, B cells need to be stimulated by [[cytokine]]s produced by [[T helper cell]]s as part of the [[Cell-mediated immunity|cellular]] response of the immune system against the pathogen.\nOnce a B cell is fully activated it rapidly proliferates and differentiates into [[plasma cell]]s.

He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of [[internal improvements]], which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn|When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> It is unclear whether the state legislature or Clay himself knew that he did not meet the Senate's age requirement at the time, though he did know of the issue later in his career.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=26}} Such an age qualification issue [[United States Senate#Qualifications|has occurred with only three other U.S. Senators]]: [[Armistead Thomson Mason]], [[John Jordan Crittenden]], and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]].}} During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including [[Chesapeake & Delaware Canal|a canal connecting]] the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=64-67}}\n\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of the state house of representatives.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=10\u201310}} That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], President Jefferson arranged passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. In support of Jefferson's policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear [[Spinning (textiles)|homespun]] suits rather than those made of imported British [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=70-71}} The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but [[Humphrey Marshall (politician)|Humphrey Marshall]], an \"aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,\" voted against it.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19.{{sfn|Remini|1991|p=55}} While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with intent of killing their opponent.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=72-73}} They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} Clay quickly recovered from his injury, and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=74}}\n\nIn 1810, U.S. Senator [[Buckner Thruston]] resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston's seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of \"[[war hawk]]s\" who favored expansionist policies.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=26\u201330}} He also advocated the annexation of [[West Florida]], which was controlled by [[Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=79-81}} On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]], arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on [[states' rights]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=81-83}} After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=76-78}} He won election unopposed in late 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=30}}\n\n==Speaker of the House==\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|upright=.90|Portrait by [[Matthew Harris Jouett]], 1818]]\n\n===Election and leadership===\n\nThe [[1810 and 1811 United States House of Representatives elections|1810-11 elections]] produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].

Clay was exceptional in his ability to control the legislative agenda through well-placed allies and the establishment of new committees, and departed from precedent by frequently taking part in floor debates.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=86}} Yet he also gained a reputation for personal courteousness and fairness in his rulings and committee appointments.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=31\u201332}} Clay's drive to increase the power of the office of speaker was aided by President [[James Madison]], who deferred to Congress in most matters.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=88-89}} [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], a member of the Democratic-Republican Party but also a member of the \"[[tertium quids]]\" group that opposed many federal initiatives, emerged as a prominent opponent of Speaker Clay.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=87-88}} While Randolph frequently attempted to obstruct Clay's initiatives, Clay became a master of parliamentary maneuvers that enabled him to advance his agenda even over the attempted obstruction of Randolph and others.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=96}}{{efn|The Clay\u2013Randolph rivalry eventually escalated into a duel in 1826, the second of two duels fought by Clay, and ended with both parties unhurt.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=65\u201367}}}}\n\n===Madison administration, 1811\u20131817===\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nClay and other House war hawks demanded that the British revoke the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]], a series of decrees that had resulted in a de facto commercial war with the United States.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=89-90}} Though Clay recognized the dangers inherent in fighting Britain, one of the most powerful countries in the world, he saw it as the only realistic alternative to a humiliating submission to British attacks on American shipping.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=33}} Clay led a successful effort in the House to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]] against Britain, complying with a request from President Madison.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, beginning the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] and Secretary of War [[William Eustis]], though he advocated for the replacement of the latter.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=99-101}} The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading War Hawk would ensure support for an Anglo-American peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress, but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=107-108}}\n\nClay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814. Clay was part of a team of five commissioners that also included Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]], Senator [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James Bayard]], ambassador [[Jonathan Russell]], and ambassador [[John Quincy Adams]], the nominal head of the American team.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=108-111}} Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American commission.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=110-115}} When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an [[Indian barrier state]] on the [[Great Lakes]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=112-113}} After a series of American military successes in 1814, the British delegation made several concessions and offered a better peace deal.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=116-117}} While Adams and Gallatin were eager to make peace as quickly as possible even if that required sub-optimal terms in the peace treaty, Clay believed that the British, worn down by years of fighting against France, greatly desired peace with the United States. Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=35\u201336}} After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to [[London]], where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=117}}\n\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives. Upon his return to Congress, Clay won election as Speaker of the House.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=119-122}} The War of 1812 strengthened Clay's support for interventionist economic policies such as federally-funded internal improvements, which he believed were necessary to improve the country's infrastructure system.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=39\u201340}} He eagerly embraced President Madison's ambitious domestic package, which included infrastructure investment, [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]] to [[protective tariffs|protect]] domestic manufacturing, and spending increases for the army and navy. With the help of [[John C. Calhoun]] and [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]], Clay passed the [[Tariff of 1816]], which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American manufacturing.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=123-125}} To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] arranged passage of a bill establishing the [[Second Bank of the United States]] (also known as the national bank).{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=125-131}} Clay also supported the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]], which would have provided a fund for internal improvements, but Madison vetoed the bill on constitutional concerns.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=132-133}} Beginning in 1818, Clay advocated for an economic plan known as the \"[[American System (economic plan)|American System]],\" which encompassed many of the economic measures, including protective tariffs and infrastructure investments, that he helped pass in the aftermath of the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n===Monroe administration, 1817\u20131825===\n{{Further|Presidency of James Monroe}}\n\nLike Jefferson and [[George Washington]], President Madison decided to retire after two terms, leaving open the Democratic-Republican nomination for the [[1816 United States presidential election|1816 presidential election]]. At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a [[congressional nominating caucus]] to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War [[William H. Crawford|William Crawford]] emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate [[Rufus King]] in the general election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=126-130}} Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state, and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=40\u201341}} Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber, and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nIn early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of [[Missouri]] after New York Congressman [[James Tallmadge, Jr.|James Tallmadge]] introduced a [[Tallmadge Amendment|legislative amendment]] that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri's slaves.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=44\u201345}} Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with the Southerners in voting down Tallmadge's amendment.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=143-144}} Clay instead supported Illinois Senator [[Jesse B.

Clay helped assemble a coalition that passed the [[Missouri Compromise]], as Thomas's proposal became known.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=45\u201346}} Further controversy ensued when Missouri's constitution banned free blacks from entering the state, but Clay was able to engineer another compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state in August 1821.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=150-152}} \n\nIn foreign policy, Clay was a leading American supporter of the [[Latin American wars of independence|independence movements and revolutions]] that broke out in [[Latin America]] beginning in 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=74\u201375}} Clay frequently called on the Monroe administration to recognize the fledgling Latin American republics, but Monroe feared that doing so would derail his plans to acquire Spanish Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=136-137}} In 1818, General [[Andrew Jackson]] crossed into Spanish Florida to suppress raids by [[Seminole]] Indians.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Though Jackson was following Monroe's implied wishes in entering Florida, he created additional controversy in seizing the Spanish town of [[Pensacola]]. Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson's actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson's decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues \"that Greece had her [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] her [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], England her [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} Jackson saw Clay's protestations as an attack on his character, and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson's expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with [[New Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=143}}\n\n====1824 presidential election====\n{{main|1824 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:House Election of 1825.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay helped Adams win the 1825 contingent House election after Clay failed to finish among the three electoral vote-winners.

Calhoun, appeared to be Clay's strongest competitors for the presidency.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=155-157}} Though many, including Clay, did not take his candidacy seriously at first, General Andrew Jackson emerged as a presidential contender, eroding Clay's base of support in the western states.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=99\u2013101}} In February 1824, the sparsely-attended Democratic-Republican congressional caucus endorsed Crawford's candidacy, but Crawford's rivals ignored the caucus results, and various state legislatures nominated candidates for president.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=96\u201397}} During the campaign, Crawford suffered a major stroke, while Calhoun withdrew from the race after Jackson won the endorsement of the Pennsylvania legislature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=162-164}}\n\nBy 1824, with Crawford still in the race, Clay concluded that no candidate would win a majority of electoral votes; in that scenario, the House of Representatives would hold a [[contingent election]] to decide the election. Under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], the top three electoral vote-getters would be eligible to be elected by the House. Clay was confident that he would prevail in a contingent held in the chamber he presided over, so long as he was eligible for election.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=110\u2013112}} Clay won Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, but the failure of Clay's supporters in New York and Louisiana relegated him to a fourth-place finish behind Adams, Jackson, and Crawford.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=174-175}} Clay was humiliated that he finished behind the invalid Crawford and Jackson, but supporters of the three remaining presidential candidates immediately began courting his support for the contingent election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=176}} \n\nFor various reasons, supporters of all three candidates believed they had the best chance of winning Clay's backing, but Clay quickly settled on supporting Adams.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=122\u2013124}} Of the three candidates, Adams was the most sympathetic to Clay's American System, and Clay viewed both Jackson and the sickly Crawford as unsuitable for the presidency.{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|pages=33\u201334, 36\u201338}} On January 9, 1825, Clay privately met with Adams for three hours, after which Clay promised Adams his support; both would later claim that they did not discuss Clay's position in an Adams administration.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=179-180}} With the help of Clay, Adams won the House vote on the first ballot.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=183-184}} After his election, Adams offered Clay the position of Secretary of State, which Clay accepted, despite fears that he would be accused of trading his support for the Cabinet post. Jackson was outraged by the election, and he and his supporters accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"[[Corrupt Bargain]].\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=184-185}} Pro-Jackson forces immediately began preparing for the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]], with the Corrupt Bargain accusation becoming their central issue.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=134\u2013136}}\n\n==Secretary of State==\n[[File:Clay-standing.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Henry Clay]]\n{{Further|Presidency of John Quincy Adams}}\n\nAs secretary of state, Clay was the top foreign policy official in the Adams administration, but he also held several domestic duties, such as oversight of the patent office.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=142\u2013143}} Clay came to like Adams, a former rival, and they developed a strong working relationship.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=187, 191-192}} Adams and Clay were both wary of forming entangling alliances with the emerging states, and they continued to uphold the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which called for European non-intervention in former colonies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=192-193}} Clay was rebuffed in his efforts to reach a commercial treaty and a settlement of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] with Britain, and was also unsuccessful in his attempts to make the French pay for damages arising from attacks on American shipping during the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=192-193}} He had more success in negotiating commercial treaties with Latin American republics, reaching \"[[most favoured nation]]\" trade agreements in attempt to ensure that no European country had a trading advantage over the United States.{{sfn|Graebner|Herring|2009|pp=555-556}} Seeking deeper relations with Latin American countries, Clay strongly favored sending American delegates to the [[Congress of Panama]], but his efforts were defeated by opponents in Senate.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n[[File:National road map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay supported construction of the [[National Road]], which extended west from [[Cumberland, Maryland]]]]\n\nAdams proposed an ambitious domestic program based in large part on Clay's American System, but Clay warned the president that many of his proposals held little chance of passage in the [[19th United States Congress|19th Congress]].{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|page=165\u2013166}} Adams's opponents defeated many of his proposals, including the establishment of a naval academy and a national observatory, but Adams did preside over the construction or initiation of major infrastructure projects like the [[National Road]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|page=166\u2013177}} Followers of Adams began to call themselves [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], and Jackson's followers became known as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=2207}} Both campaigns spread untrue stories about the opposing candidates.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=134}} Adams followers denounced Jackson as a demagogue, and some Adams-aligned papers accused Jackson's wife, [[Rachel Jackson]], of [[bigamy]].

Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court.

He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company.

Clay's compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson's supporters on an alternative tariff bill.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=217\u2013218}} Though most members of Clay's own National Republican Party opposed it, the [[Tariff of 1833]] passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Nonetheless, Taylor won the election, taking 47.3 percent of the popular vote and 163 of 290 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=443-444}}\n\n===Taylor and Fillmore administrations, 1849\u20131852===\n{{see also|Presidency of Zachary Taylor|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 352\n| image1 = United States 1849-1850.png\n| caption1 = {{center|The United States after the ratification of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], with the [[Mexican Cession]] still unorganized}}\n| image2 = United States 1850-1853-03.png\n| caption2 = {{center|The United States after the Compromise of 1850}}\n}}\n\nIncreasingly worried about the sectional tensions arising over the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories, Clay accepted election to the Senate in 1849.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=444, 454}} Having refused to campaign for Taylor, Clay played little role in the formation of Taylor's Cabinet or in determining the new administration's policies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=460}} In January 1850, with Congress still deadlocked regarding the status of the Mexican Cession, Clay proposed a compromise designed to organize territory acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War and address other issues contributing to sectional tensions.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=461\u2013462}} His legislative package included the admission of [[California]] as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent [[Fugitive slave laws|fugitive slave law]].{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=111\u2013112}} Though it faced opposition from Southern extremists like Calhoun and Northern abolitionists like [[William Seward]], Clay's proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=112\u2013119}} \n\nPresident Taylor, who favored the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states without any attached conditions, opposed the plan, and Clay openly broke with the president in May 1850.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=359, 364\u2013365}} Debate over Clay's proposal continued into July, when Taylor unexpectedly died of an illness.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013366}} After Taylor's death, President Fillmore, who supported Clay's compromise bill, consulted with Clay in appointing a new Cabinet.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=465}} Exhausted by the debate in the Senate, Clay took a leave of absence shortly after Taylor's death, but Fillmore, Webster, and Democratic Senator [[Stephen A.

Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013367}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henry Clay monument.jpg|thumb|Henry Clay monument and mausoleum, Lexington Cemetery]]\n\nIn December 1851, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}} On June 29, 1852, Clay died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 75 in his room at the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]].<ref>John DeFerrari.

Crosby: An Autobiography'' ([[Peabody, Massachusetts]]: Hendrickson Publishers Marketing, 2013 printing), p. 87, {{ISBN|978-1-59856-281-1}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Ideology and slavery==\n===American System===\n{{main|American System (economic plan)}}\n\nThroughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Mississippi Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\".{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=761\u2013762}}<ref name=\"king1\">{{cite magazine|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=The Day Henry Clay Refused to Compromise|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-day-henry-clay-refused-to-compromise-153589853/?no-ist|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Smithsonian|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian, John J.

The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram A, the warp]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram B, the weft]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram C, the tartan. The combining of the warp and weft.]]\n\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]].

In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n;Ancient colours: refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n;Muted colours: also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used.

By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It is not until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind of uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] pp. 66\u201367.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the Highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{efn|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: \"each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence&nbsp;...\"<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 65\u201366. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An incident in the rebellion of 1745''. The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] p. 84.</ref>]]\nIt is generally regarded that \"clan tartans\" date no earlier than the beginning of the 19th century, and are an example of an [[invented tradition]]. Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

Evidence suggests that in 1725 the Independent Highland Companies may have worn a uniform tartan.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" />\n\n==Modern tartans==\nBy the 19th century the Highland romantic revival, inspired by [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems and the writings of Sir [[Walter Scott]], led to wider interest, with clubs like the Celtic Society of Edinburgh welcoming Lowlanders. The pageantry invented for the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] brought a sudden demand for tartan cloth and made it the [[Folk costume|national dress]] of the whole of Scotland, rather than just the Highlands and Islands, with the invention of many new clan-specific tartans to suit.\n\n===Georgian royal patronage===\n{{Further|Visit of King George IV to Scotland}}\n\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Wilkie]]'s idealised depiction of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in full [[Highland dress]], during the visit to Scotland in 1822{{efn|Sir [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s portrait of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] depicts the king as being much slimmer than he actually was.

Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a.

In consequence of its association with the British aristocracy and military, tartan developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan has made reappearances in the world of fashion several times.\n\n[[File:Punkertreffen 1984 - Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|A German [[Punk subculture|punk]] wearing a piece of the [[Royal Stewart tartan]], 1984]]\nFor instance, tartan made a resurgence in its use in [[punk fashion]].

Even so, there are no laws or rules on who can, or cannot, wear a particular tartan. The concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term of ''universal tartan'', or ''free tartan'', which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone.

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==Popular Culture==\n* [[Doctor Who]] features tartan.

The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram A, the warp]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram B, the weft]]\n[[File:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|right|150px|thumb|Diagram C, the tartan. The combining of the warp and weft.]]\n\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604051800/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] }}</ref>\n\n===Colour: shades and meaning===\n\nThe shades of colour in tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan.

In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n;Ancient colours: refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n;Muted colours: also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used. For example, the colour ''green'' sometimes represents [[prairie]]s or forests, ''blue'' can represent lakes and rivers, and the colour ''yellow'' is sometimes used to represent various [[crop]]s.<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-medieval origins===\n\n[[File:Scottish soldiers in service of Gustavus Adolphus, 1631-cropped-.jpg|thumb|The earliest image of Scottish soldiers wearing tartan, 1631 German engraving.<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--63\"/>{{efn|The Highlanders depicted were sometimes mistakenly described as [[Irish people|Irish]] \"Irrl\u00e4nder oder Irren\".

''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An incident in the rebellion of 1745''.

Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

Evidence suggests that in 1725 the Independent Highland Companies may have worn a uniform tartan.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" />\n\n==Modern tartans==\nBy the 19th century the Highland romantic revival, inspired by [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems and the writings of Sir [[Walter Scott]], led to wider interest, with clubs like the Celtic Society of Edinburgh welcoming Lowlanders. The pageantry invented for the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] brought a sudden demand for tartan cloth and made it the [[Folk costume|national dress]] of the whole of Scotland, rather than just the Highlands and Islands, with the invention of many new clan-specific tartans to suit.\n\n===Georgian royal patronage===\n{{Further|Visit of King George IV to Scotland}}\n\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Wilkie]]'s idealised depiction of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in full [[Highland dress]], during the visit to Scotland in 1822{{efn|Sir [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s portrait of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] depicts the king as being much slimmer than he actually was.

Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the red ''Royal Stewart'' and the green ''Hunting Stewart'' tartans for carpets, while using the ''Dress Stewart'' for curtains and upholstery. The Queen designed the ''Victoria'' tartan, and Prince Albert the ''Balmoral'', still used as a royal tartan today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tartan in Royal Dress |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/fashioning-a-reign/palace-of-holyroodhouse/tartan-in-royal-dress |accessdate=3 February 2020 |agency=Royal Collection Trust}}</ref>\n\nVictoria and Albert spent a considerable amount of time at their estate, and in doing so hosted many \"Highland\" activities.

Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a.

Even so, there are no laws or rules on who can, or cannot, wear a particular tartan. The concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term of ''universal tartan'', or ''free tartan'', which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone. Traditional examples of such are ''Black Watch'', ''Caledonian'', ''Hunting Stewart'', and ''Jacobite'' tartans, and many district or regional tartans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/universal.cfm.htm |title=Universal Tartans |accessdate=18 October 2008 |website=tartans.scotland.net}}</ref> In the same line of opinion, some tartan attributed to the [[British Royal Family]] are claimed by some to be \"off limits\" to non-royalty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartans.scotland.net/tartan_types/royal.cfm.htm |title=Royal Tartans |accessdate=18 October 2008 |website=tartans.scotland.net}}</ref><ref name=\"Hutcheson Royal Tartan\"/>\n\n[[File:Burberry pattern.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Burberry]] Check]]\nHowever, some modern tartans are protected by [[trademark]] law, and the trademark proprietor can, in certain circumstances, prevent others from selling that tartan.<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\">[[#M2|MacDonald (1995)]] p. 48.</ref> The \"[[Burberry]] Check\" of the English fashion house, first designed in early 1920s, is an instantly recognisable tartan that is very well known around the world<ref>[[#H|Haig (2004)]] p. 143.</ref> and is an example of a tartan that is protected.{{efn|In 2003 [[Burberry]] demanded members of the tartan industry to stop trading a certain ''Camel Thomson'' tartan.<ref name=\"findarticles.com--ai_n12582587\"/> Burberry claimed this tartan, which dates from 1906, was confusingly similar to their ''Burberry Check'' and that it thus infringed their registered trademark.<ref name=\"findarticles.com--ai_n12582587\">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030518/ai_n12582587 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310164731/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030518/ai_n12582587 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 March 2007 |title=Fashion giant Burberry tries to kill off traditional tartan rival |last=McDougall |first=Liam |date=18 May 2003 |accessdate=7 May 2009 |newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]] |via=findarticles.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-tartans-world-register.com/tartan.aspx?record=2420 |title=Tartan \u2013 Thompson / Thomson / MacTavish camel |accessdate=18 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Society|Scottish Tartans World Register]]}}</ref>}}\n\nMany books on Scottish clans list such rules and guidelines.<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/> One such opinion is that people not bearing a clan surname, or surname claimed as a sept of a clan, should not wear the tartan of their mother's clan.<ref name=\"TheScottishClansandTheirTartans14\">[[#A1|''The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans'' (2005)]] p. 14.</ref> This opinion is enforced by the fact that in the Scottish clan system, the Lord Lyon states that membership to a clan technically passes through the surname.

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Scotland|United Kingdom}}\n[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scottish actor [[Sean Connery]] at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in Washington D.C.]]\n* [[Argyle (pattern)]]\n* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], whose athletic mascot is Scotty the Scottie Dog; their athletic teams are known as \"The Tartans\"\n* [[Check (pattern)]]\n* [[Flannel]]\n* [[List of tartans]]\n* [[List of U.S. state tartans]], officially recognised tartans of states in the US (created in the 1980s)\n* [[Madras (cloth)]]\n* [[Regional tartans of Canada]], officially recognised tartans of the provinces and territories of Canada (created in the 1950s)\n* [[Sobieski Stuarts]]\n* [[Tartan Army]], popular name for the fans of the Scotland football team\n* [[Tartan Day]], a day of celebration, in Canada and the US, recognising the influence of Scottish immigration to these countries\n* [[Tartanry]]\n* ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', the Victorian forgery that is the source of many of today's clan tartans\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-6815-X |ref=A1}} (originally published by: W. & A.
