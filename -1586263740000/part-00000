Prior to Islamic influence, Javanese already recognised several term to describe clothings, such as ''kulambi'' (clothes), ''sarwul'' (pants), and ''ken'' (''kain'' or long fabric wrapped around the waist).<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/> During the last period of Majapahit kingdom, Islamic influence began to grow in coastal Javanese towns, thus there was a need to adapt the Javanese fashion to the newly adopted [[Islam]] religion. The tailored blouse, often made from delicate sheer fabrics, were worn over ''kemban'' torso wrap to cover the back, shoulders and arms, in order for court ladies to appear more modest. The adoption of a more modest fashion was attributed to the Islamic influence upon the archipelago.<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/>\nAceh, Riau and Johor Kingdoms and Northern Sumatra adopted the Javanese style kebaya as a means of social expression of status with the more ''alus'' or refined Javanese overlords.<ref name=\"Chavalit\">Maenmas Chavalit, Maneepin Phromsuthirak: ''Costumes in ASEAN'': ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information: 2000: \n{{ISBN|974-7102-83-8}}, 293 pages</ref>\n\nThe name of Kebaya as a particular clothing type was noted by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] when they landed in [[Indonesia]]. Kebaya is associated with a type of [[blouse]] worn by Indonesian women in 15th or 16th century. Prior to 1600, kebaya on Java island were considered as a reserved clothing to be worn only by [[royal family]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (''bangsawan'') and [[priyayi|minor nobility]], in an era when peasant men and many women walked publicly bare-chested.\n[[File:Sundanese Grandma.jpg|thumb|right|140px|An elderly [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] woman wearing simple kebaya, kain batik and batik headcloth, [[West Java]].]]\nLater on, the kebaya also being adopted by commoners, the peasant women in Java. Up until this day in rural agricultural villages of Java, farmer women still uses simple kebaya, especially among elderly women. The everyday kebaya worn by peasant were of simple materials and secured with simple pin or ''peniti'' ([[safety pin]]). \n\nSlowly it naturally spread to neighbouring areas through trade, diplomacy and social interactions to [[Malacca]], [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Mindanao]].<ref>S.

At [[Jakarta MRT|MRT Station]] in [[Jakarta]], a number of kebaya enthusiasts campaigned to promote kebaya as everyday fashion for work as well as for casual clothing on weekend.

B. R.

Kebaya blouse can be tailored tight-fitting or loose-fitting, made from various materials, from cotton or velvet, to fine silk, exquisite lace and brocade, decorated with stitching or glittering sequins. \n\n;Undergarments: Because many of kebaya fabrics are made of fine, sheer and semi-transparent materials, there is a need to wear undergarments beneath to cover the breasts for modesty purpose. Traditionally, Javanese women wearing ''kemben'' torso wrap beneath their kebaya. Today however, the undergarment use under kebaya usually either [[corset]], [[bra]] or [[camisole]] with matching colour. The more simple and modest undergarment wore by common village women, usually elderly women, is called ''kutang'', which is a bra-like undergarment made from cotton. \n\n;Kerongsang brooch: Traditional kebaya had no buttons down the front. To secure the blouse openings in the front, a decorative metal [[brooch]] is applied on the chest. It can be made from brass, iron, silver or gold, decorated with semi-precious stones. A typical three-piece kerongsang is composed of a ''kerongsang ibu'' (mother piece) that is larger and heavier than the other two ''kerongsang anak'' (child piece). ''Kerongsang'' brooch often made from [[gold]] jewelry and considered as the sign of social status of aristocracy, wealth and nobility, however for commoners and peasant women, simple and plain kebaya often only fastened with modest [[safety pin]] (''peniti'').\n\n;Kain sarong or skirt: Kain is a long decorated clothes wrapped around the hips, secured with rope and wore as a kind of [[sarong]] or skirt.  The skirt or ''kain'' is an unstitched fabric wrap around three metres long. The term ''sarong'' in English is erroneous, the ''sarung'' (Malaysian accent: sarong) is actually stitched together to form a tube, ''kain'' is unstitched, requires a helper to dress (literally wrap) the wearer and is held in place with a string (''tali''), then folded this string at the waist, then held with a belt (''sabuk'' or ''ikat pinggang''), which may hold a decorative pocket. In Java, Bali and Sunda, the kain is commonly [[batik]] which may be from plain stamped cotton to elaborately hand-painted ''batik tulis'' embroidered silk with gold thread. In [[Lampung]], the kain is the traditional ''tapis'', an elaborate gold-thread embroidered ikat with small mica discs.<ref>Inger McCabe Elliott ''Batik: Fabled Cloth of Java'', Hong Kong: Periplus, 2004</ref> Sumatra, Flores, Lemata Timor, and other islands commonly use kain of ikat or songket. Sumba is famous for kain decorated with ''lau hada'': shells and beads.<ref>Mattiebelle Gittinger, ''To Speak with Cloth: studies in Indonesian textiles'' University of California, 1989</ref>\n\n==Variants of Kebaya elements==\n[[File:Batik kain worn by female hat seller, Yogkakarta.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Simple Kutubaru kebaya (square collar) worn by a Javanese woman in Yogyakarta]]\n;Collars: In the aspect of collar or neck cut, there are two main varieties; the V shaped collar (Javanese, Kartini, Balinese, and Encim or Peranakan) and the square collar cut (Kutubaru). The Sundanese and modern kebaya has U shaped collar edged with brocade and often decorated with sequins. Modern kebaya also might apply various shapes and curves of collars.\n\n;Fabrics: In fabrics aspect, the blouse known as ''baju kebaya'' may be of two main forms: the transparent or semi-transparent straighter cut blouse of Java, Bali, or the more plain and modest kebaya of Sumatra and Malaya.\n\n;Cut and fittings: In the cut aspect, two main varieties are; the more tightly tailored Java, Bali and Sunda kebaya, and the loose-fitting modest kebaya wore by more pious Muslim women, usually wore with hijab. The more Islamic compatible, a plainer and modest ''[[baju kurung]]'' is a loose-fitting, knee-length long-sleeved blouse worn in the more Muslim areas, including the former Kingdom of Johor-Riau (now Malaysia), Sumatra, Brunei and parts of coastal Borneo and Java.\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Kebaya Fanbo Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Indonesian woman in kebaya and kain [[batik]].

Kebaya Kartini usually made from a fine but non-transparent fabrics, and white is a favoured colour. Basic Kebaya Kartini might be plain. The adornment is quite minimal, only stitching or applied laces along the edges. The V-shaped collar cut of this type of kebaya is quite similar to the Peranakan Encim kebaya, however it is distinguishes by its distinctive fold on the chest. Another feature of the Kartini kebaya is the length of the kebaya that covers the hips, and the collar folds with a vertical line shape, which creates the tall and slender impression of the wearer.<ref name=\"Gosocio\">{{cite web | work = Go Socio | title = Mengenal Jenis-Jenis Kebaya di Indonesia| url = http://gosocio.co.id/mengenal-jenis-jenis-kebaya-di-indonesia.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> The Kartini-style kebaya inspired the cut and style of [[Garuda Indonesia]]'s flight attendants' uniform.\n\n===Kebaya Jawa===\nThis type of kebaya from Java has a simple shape with a V-neck. This straight and simple cut gives an impression of simple elegance. Usually a Javanese kebaya is made of semi-transparent fine fabric patterned with floral stitching or embroidery, sometimes adorned with sequins. Other fabrics might be used, including cotton, brocade, silk and velvet. The semi-transparent kebaya is worn over matching underwear, either corset, bra or camisole.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\n===Kebaya Kutubaru===\nThe basic form of Kutubaru kebaya is quite similar to other types of kebaya.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> What distinguishes it is the additional fabric called ''bef'' to connect the left and right side of the kebaya in the chest and abdomen. This create a square or rectangle shaped collar. This type of kebaya was meant to recreate the look of unsecured kebaya wore over matching ''[[kemben]]'' (torso wrap) undergarment.

The Balinese kebaya usually has V neck line with folded collar sometimes decorated with laces. They are usually tight-fitting made with colorful semi-transparent or plain fabrics either cotton or brocade, patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. Unlike traditional Javanese kebaya, Balinese kebaya might add buttons in the front opening, and kerongsang brooch is seldom used. The main difference is Balinese kebaya add [[Obi (sash)|obi-like]] [[sash]] upon kebaya, wrap around the waist.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\nThe Balinese kebaya is part of ''busana adat'' or customary dress, Balinese women are required to wear kebaya during [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] rituals and ceremony in [[Balinese temple|pura]]. White kebaya are favoured for Balinese religious rituals. Other than religious ceremony, contemporary Balinese women also often wear kebaya for their daily activities. Because most Balinese people are Hindus, the Balinese kebaya usually has shorter sleeves compared to Javanese kebaya.\n\n===Kebaya Sunda===\n[[File:Seren Taun 1012 Bogor B.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Girls in white Sundanese kebaya during [[Seren Taun]] harvest festival.]]\nTight-fitting brocade [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kebaya allows more freedom in design, and much applied in modern kebaya and wedding kebaya in Indonesia. The semi-transparent fabrics is patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. The main difference with other kebaya style is the U collar neckline, often applying broad curves to cover shoulders and chest. Another difference is the extra long lower parts of kebaya, with hanging edges which covers hips and thigh. The contemporary wedding kebaya dress even has sweeping long [[Train (clothing)|train]].\n\n===Kebaya Encim or Peranakan===\n[[File:Kebaya 1.jpg|thumb|left|A group of women posing in traditional [[Peranakan]] ''nonya'' kebaya]]\nIn Java, the kebaya worn by ladies of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese ancestry]] is called ''kebaya encim'', derived from the name ''encim'' or ''enci'' to refer to a married Chinese woman.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://female.kompas.com/read/2013/01/13/10574438/Tantangan.Bisnis.Kebaya.Encim\n |title      = Tantangan Bisnis Kebaya Encim\n |last       = Agnes Swetta Pandia & Nina Susilo\n |first      =\n |date       = 13 January 2013\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Female Kompas.com\n |accessdate = 19 January 2013\n}}\n</ref> It was commonly worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as [[Semarang]], Lasem, Tuban, [[Surabaya]], [[Pekalongan]] and [[Cirebon]]. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its smaller and finer embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colors, made from imported materials such as silk and other fine fabrics. The encim kebaya fit well with vibrant-colored kain [[Batik#Pesisir Batik (Coastal Batik)|batik pesisiran]] (Javan coastal batik).<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/>\n\nIn [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], a different variety of kebaya is called \"nyonya kebaya\" and worn by those of Chinese ancestry: the [[Peranakan]] people. The ''Nyonya kebaya'' is different in its famously intricately hand-beaded shoes (''kasut manek'') and use of kain with Chinese motive batik or imported printed or hand-painted Chinese silks. Other than Malacca, the ''nyonya kebaya'' is also popular in other straits settlements of [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]. The similar Nyonya Kebaya can also be found [[Phuket]], where they shared the similar Peranakan culture with the historical [[Strait Settlements]].\n\n===Kebaya Noni or Indo===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van mevrouw Van der Willegen met haar zestien dagen oude baby Johan Harmen Rudolf TMnr 60054017.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Dutch colonial lady in kebaya and kain batik, Dutch East Indies 1920]]\nKebaya Indo is also known as kebaya Noni, derived from the term ''noni'' or ''nona'' which literally means \"miss\" to refer a young girl or unmarried woman of European descent.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> During the [[Dutch East Indies]] era of Indonesia, [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) women also colonial European women of high status adopted the kebaya, which provided less restrictive and cooler clothing, as a formal or social dress. Colonial ladies abandon their tight  [[corset]] and wear light and comfortable undergarment under their kebaya. Indos and colonials probably adopted kebaya inherited from the clothing worn by [[Njai]], [[Native Indonesian|native]] women kept as housekeepers, companions, and concubines in the colonial households. Njai ladies were the ancestors of Indo people (mixed European and Asian ancestry).\n\nThe cut and style of kebaya worn by the Dutch and Indo ladies were actually derived from Javanese kebaya. Nevertheless, there are some slight differences, European women wore shorter sleeves and total length cotton in prints, adorned with laces often imported from Europe. The kebaya worn by colonials and Indo ladies mostly are white and has light fabrics, this was meant to provide pleasant and cooler clothing in hot and humid tropical climate, since dark colored fabrics attract and retain heat. \n\nThe day kebaya of the [[Indo people]] was of white cotton trimmed with oriental motif handmade lace, either locally made in East Indies, or imported from [[Bruges]] or the [[Netherlands]]. While black silk kebaya is used for evening wear.\n\n==Political significance==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM In juni 1950 organiseerde de leiding van de KOWANI (Kongres Wanita Indonesia) in Djakarta een congres dat door alle afdelingen in Indonesi\u00eb werd bijgewoond TMnr 10000216.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sukarno]] among Indonesian women in kebaya during Indonesian Women Congress 1950]]\nIn Japanese internment camps [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|during the Second World War]], Indonesian female prisoners refused to wear the western dress allocated them and instead wore ''kebaya'' as a display of nationalist and racial solidarity to separate them from fellow Chinese, Europeans and Eurasian inmates.<ref>Cattoni ''Reading The Kebaya'' paper was presented to the 15th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Canberra 29 June-2 July 2004: 8</ref>\n\nThe only woman present during Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence, Dutch-educated activist [[SK Trimurti]], wore ''kebaya,'' cementing it as the female dress of Nationalism.<br />\n\nAfter Indonesian independence, Sukarno appointed kebaya as a national costume of Indonesian women.<ref name=\"GNFI-Kebaya\"/> Kebayas as the national costume of Indonesian women were often featured by Indonesian first ladies. The wives of [[Sukarno]], Indonesian first president; [[Fatmawati|Fatmawati Sukarno]] and [[Dewi Sukarno]] were known to wear kebaya everyday.\n\nThe 21st of April is celebrated in Indonesia as National Kartini Day where [[Kartini|Raden Ajeng Kartini]], the female suffragist and education advocate, is remembered by schoolgirls wearing traditional dress according to their region. In Java, Bali and Sunda it is the ''kebaya''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe [[Suharto]]-era bureaucrat wives' social organisation ''Dharma Wanita'' wears a uniform of gold kebaya, with a red sash (''selendang'') and stamped batik pattern on the ''kain'' unique to ''Dharma Wanita''. The late Indonesian first lady and also a minor aristocrat [[Tien Suharto]] was a prominent advocate of the ''kebaya''.\n\nFormer President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] is a public champion of ''kebaya'' and wears fine red ''kebaya'' whenever possible in public forums and 2009 Presidential election debates.\n\n==Modern usage and innovations==\n[[File:Garuda Indonesia Flight Attendants New Costumes 2010 Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendant uniform in kebaya and kain [[batik]].]]\n\nKebaya has been one of the important parts of oriental style of clothing that heavily influenced the world of modern fashion. Lace dresses are one of the best examples of Kebaya influence.\n\nApart from traditional kebaya, fashion designers are looking into ways of modifying the design and making kebaya a more fashionable outfit. Casual designed kebaya can even be worn with jeans or skirts. For weddings or formal events, many designers are exploring other types of fine fabrics like laces to create a bridal kebaya.\n\nModern-day kebaya now incorporate modern tailoring innovations such as clasps, zippers and buttons zippers, being a much appreciated addition for ladies' that promptly need a toilet break, without requiring being literally unwrapped by a helper\u2014to the extent the true traditional kain is near unanimously rejected. Other modern innovations have included the blouse ''baju kebaya'' worn without the restrictive kemben, and even the kebaya blouse worn with slacks or made of the fabric usually for the ''kain panjang''. The female flight attendants of [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] also feature batik kebaya as their uniforms.\n\nThe female uniform of [[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendants is a more authentic modern interpretation.

The tailored blouse, often made from delicate sheer fabrics, were worn over ''kemban'' torso wrap to cover the back, shoulders and arms, in order for court ladies to appear more modest. The adoption of a more modest fashion was attributed to the Islamic influence upon the archipelago.<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/>\nAceh, Riau and Johor Kingdoms and Northern Sumatra adopted the Javanese style kebaya as a means of social expression of status with the more ''alus'' or refined Javanese overlords.<ref name=\"Chavalit\">Maenmas Chavalit, Maneepin Phromsuthirak: ''Costumes in ASEAN'': ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information: 2000: \n{{ISBN|974-7102-83-8}}, 293 pages</ref>\n\nThe name of Kebaya as a particular clothing type was noted by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] when they landed in [[Indonesia]]. Kebaya is associated with a type of [[blouse]] worn by Indonesian women in 15th or 16th century. Prior to 1600, kebaya on Java island were considered as a reserved clothing to be worn only by [[royal family]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (''bangsawan'') and [[priyayi|minor nobility]], in an era when peasant men and many women walked publicly bare-chested.\n[[File:Sundanese Grandma.jpg|thumb|right|140px|An elderly [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] woman wearing simple kebaya, kain batik and batik headcloth, [[West Java]].]]\nLater on, the kebaya also being adopted by commoners, the peasant women in Java.

Kebaya blouse can be tailored tight-fitting or loose-fitting, made from various materials, from cotton or velvet, to fine silk, exquisite lace and brocade, decorated with stitching or glittering sequins. \n\n;Undergarments: Because many of kebaya fabrics are made of fine, sheer and semi-transparent materials, there is a need to wear undergarments beneath to cover the breasts for modesty purpose. Traditionally, Javanese women wearing ''kemben'' torso wrap beneath their kebaya. Today however, the undergarment use under kebaya usually either [[corset]], [[bra]] or [[camisole]] with matching colour. The more simple and modest undergarment wore by common village women, usually elderly women, is called ''kutang'', which is a bra-like undergarment made from cotton. \n\n;Kerongsang brooch: Traditional kebaya had no buttons down the front. To secure the blouse openings in the front, a decorative metal [[brooch]] is applied on the chest. It can be made from brass, iron, silver or gold, decorated with semi-precious stones. A typical three-piece kerongsang is composed of a ''kerongsang ibu'' (mother piece) that is larger and heavier than the other two ''kerongsang anak'' (child piece). ''Kerongsang'' brooch often made from [[gold]] jewelry and considered as the sign of social status of aristocracy, wealth and nobility, however for commoners and peasant women, simple and plain kebaya often only fastened with modest [[safety pin]] (''peniti'').\n\n;Kain sarong or skirt: Kain is a long decorated clothes wrapped around the hips, secured with rope and wore as a kind of [[sarong]] or skirt.  The skirt or ''kain'' is an unstitched fabric wrap around three metres long. The term ''sarong'' in English is erroneous, the ''sarung'' (Malaysian accent: sarong) is actually stitched together to form a tube, ''kain'' is unstitched, requires a helper to dress (literally wrap) the wearer and is held in place with a string (''tali''), then folded this string at the waist, then held with a belt (''sabuk'' or ''ikat pinggang''), which may hold a decorative pocket. In Java, Bali and Sunda, the kain is commonly [[batik]] which may be from plain stamped cotton to elaborately hand-painted ''batik tulis'' embroidered silk with gold thread. In [[Lampung]], the kain is the traditional ''tapis'', an elaborate gold-thread embroidered ikat with small mica discs.<ref>Inger McCabe Elliott ''Batik: Fabled Cloth of Java'', Hong Kong: Periplus, 2004</ref> Sumatra, Flores, Lemata Timor, and other islands commonly use kain of ikat or songket.

The Sundanese and modern kebaya has U shaped collar edged with brocade and often decorated with sequins. Modern kebaya also might apply various shapes and curves of collars.\n\n;Fabrics: In fabrics aspect, the blouse known as ''baju kebaya'' may be of two main forms: the transparent or semi-transparent straighter cut blouse of Java, Bali, or the more plain and modest kebaya of Sumatra and Malaya.\n\n;Cut and fittings: In the cut aspect, two main varieties are; the more tightly tailored Java, Bali and Sunda kebaya, and the loose-fitting modest kebaya wore by more pious Muslim women, usually wore with hijab. The more Islamic compatible, a plainer and modest ''[[baju kurung]]'' is a loose-fitting, knee-length long-sleeved blouse worn in the more Muslim areas, including the former Kingdom of Johor-Riau (now Malaysia), Sumatra, Brunei and parts of coastal Borneo and Java.\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Kebaya Fanbo Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Indonesian woman in kebaya and kain [[batik]].

The adornment is quite minimal, only stitching or applied laces along the edges. The V-shaped collar cut of this type of kebaya is quite similar to the Peranakan Encim kebaya, however it is distinguishes by its distinctive fold on the chest. Another feature of the Kartini kebaya is the length of the kebaya that covers the hips, and the collar folds with a vertical line shape, which creates the tall and slender impression of the wearer.<ref name=\"Gosocio\">{{cite web | work = Go Socio | title = Mengenal Jenis-Jenis Kebaya di Indonesia| url = http://gosocio.co.id/mengenal-jenis-jenis-kebaya-di-indonesia.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> The Kartini-style kebaya inspired the cut and style of [[Garuda Indonesia]]'s flight attendants' uniform.\n\n===Kebaya Jawa===\nThis type of kebaya from Java has a simple shape with a V-neck. This straight and simple cut gives an impression of simple elegance. Usually a Javanese kebaya is made of semi-transparent fine fabric patterned with floral stitching or embroidery, sometimes adorned with sequins. Other fabrics might be used, including cotton, brocade, silk and velvet. The semi-transparent kebaya is worn over matching underwear, either corset, bra or camisole.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\n===Kebaya Kutubaru===\nThe basic form of Kutubaru kebaya is quite similar to other types of kebaya.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> What distinguishes it is the additional fabric called ''bef'' to connect the left and right side of the kebaya in the chest and abdomen.

The Balinese kebaya usually has V neck line with folded collar sometimes decorated with laces. They are usually tight-fitting made with colorful semi-transparent or plain fabrics either cotton or brocade, patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. Unlike traditional Javanese kebaya, Balinese kebaya might add buttons in the front opening, and kerongsang brooch is seldom used. The main difference is Balinese kebaya add [[Obi (sash)|obi-like]] [[sash]] upon kebaya, wrap around the waist.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\nThe Balinese kebaya is part of ''busana adat'' or customary dress, Balinese women are required to wear kebaya during [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] rituals and ceremony in [[Balinese temple|pura]]. White kebaya are favoured for Balinese religious rituals. Other than religious ceremony, contemporary Balinese women also often wear kebaya for their daily activities. Because most Balinese people are Hindus, the Balinese kebaya usually has shorter sleeves compared to Javanese kebaya.\n\n===Kebaya Sunda===\n[[File:Seren Taun 1012 Bogor B.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Girls in white Sundanese kebaya during [[Seren Taun]] harvest festival.]]\nTight-fitting brocade [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kebaya allows more freedom in design, and much applied in modern kebaya and wedding kebaya in Indonesia. The semi-transparent fabrics is patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. The main difference with other kebaya style is the U collar neckline, often applying broad curves to cover shoulders and chest. Another difference is the extra long lower parts of kebaya, with hanging edges which covers hips and thigh. The contemporary wedding kebaya dress even has sweeping long [[Train (clothing)|train]].\n\n===Kebaya Encim or Peranakan===\n[[File:Kebaya 1.jpg|thumb|left|A group of women posing in traditional [[Peranakan]] ''nonya'' kebaya]]\nIn Java, the kebaya worn by ladies of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese ancestry]] is called ''kebaya encim'', derived from the name ''encim'' or ''enci'' to refer to a married Chinese woman.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://female.kompas.com/read/2013/01/13/10574438/Tantangan.Bisnis.Kebaya.Encim\n |title      = Tantangan Bisnis Kebaya Encim\n |last       = Agnes Swetta Pandia & Nina Susilo\n |first      =\n |date       = 13 January 2013\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Female Kompas.com\n |accessdate = 19 January 2013\n}}\n</ref> It was commonly worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as [[Semarang]], Lasem, Tuban, [[Surabaya]], [[Pekalongan]] and [[Cirebon]]. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its smaller and finer embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colors, made from imported materials such as silk and other fine fabrics. The encim kebaya fit well with vibrant-colored kain [[Batik#Pesisir Batik (Coastal Batik)|batik pesisiran]] (Javan coastal batik).<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/>\n\nIn [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], a different variety of kebaya is called \"nyonya kebaya\" and worn by those of Chinese ancestry: the [[Peranakan]] people. The ''Nyonya kebaya'' is different in its famously intricately hand-beaded shoes (''kasut manek'') and use of kain with Chinese motive batik or imported printed or hand-painted Chinese silks. Other than Malacca, the ''nyonya kebaya'' is also popular in other straits settlements of [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]. The similar Nyonya Kebaya can also be found [[Phuket]], where they shared the similar Peranakan culture with the historical [[Strait Settlements]].\n\n===Kebaya Noni or Indo===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van mevrouw Van der Willegen met haar zestien dagen oude baby Johan Harmen Rudolf TMnr 60054017.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Dutch colonial lady in kebaya and kain batik, Dutch East Indies 1920]]\nKebaya Indo is also known as kebaya Noni, derived from the term ''noni'' or ''nona'' which literally means \"miss\" to refer a young girl or unmarried woman of European descent.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> During the [[Dutch East Indies]] era of Indonesia, [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) women also colonial European women of high status adopted the kebaya, which provided less restrictive and cooler clothing, as a formal or social dress. Colonial ladies abandon their tight  [[corset]] and wear light and comfortable undergarment under their kebaya. Indos and colonials probably adopted kebaya inherited from the clothing worn by [[Njai]], [[Native Indonesian|native]] women kept as housekeepers, companions, and concubines in the colonial households. Njai ladies were the ancestors of Indo people (mixed European and Asian ancestry).\n\nThe cut and style of kebaya worn by the Dutch and Indo ladies were actually derived from Javanese kebaya. Nevertheless, there are some slight differences, European women wore shorter sleeves and total length cotton in prints, adorned with laces often imported from Europe. The kebaya worn by colonials and Indo ladies mostly are white and has light fabrics, this was meant to provide pleasant and cooler clothing in hot and humid tropical climate, since dark colored fabrics attract and retain heat. \n\nThe day kebaya of the [[Indo people]] was of white cotton trimmed with oriental motif handmade lace, either locally made in East Indies, or imported from [[Bruges]] or the [[Netherlands]]. While black silk kebaya is used for evening wear.\n\n==Political significance==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM In juni 1950 organiseerde de leiding van de KOWANI (Kongres Wanita Indonesia) in Djakarta een congres dat door alle afdelingen in Indonesi\u00eb werd bijgewoond TMnr 10000216.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sukarno]] among Indonesian women in kebaya during Indonesian Women Congress 1950]]\nIn Japanese internment camps [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|during the Second World War]], Indonesian female prisoners refused to wear the western dress allocated them and instead wore ''kebaya'' as a display of nationalist and racial solidarity to separate them from fellow Chinese, Europeans and Eurasian inmates.<ref>Cattoni ''Reading The Kebaya'' paper was presented to the 15th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Canberra 29 June-2 July 2004: 8</ref>\n\nThe only woman present during Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence, Dutch-educated activist [[SK Trimurti]], wore ''kebaya,'' cementing it as the female dress of Nationalism.<br />\n\nAfter Indonesian independence, Sukarno appointed kebaya as a national costume of Indonesian women.<ref name=\"GNFI-Kebaya\"/> Kebayas as the national costume of Indonesian women were often featured by Indonesian first ladies. The wives of [[Sukarno]], Indonesian first president; [[Fatmawati|Fatmawati Sukarno]] and [[Dewi Sukarno]] were known to wear kebaya everyday.\n\nThe 21st of April is celebrated in Indonesia as National Kartini Day where [[Kartini|Raden Ajeng Kartini]], the female suffragist and education advocate, is remembered by schoolgirls wearing traditional dress according to their region. In Java, Bali and Sunda it is the ''kebaya''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe [[Suharto]]-era bureaucrat wives' social organisation ''Dharma Wanita'' wears a uniform of gold kebaya, with a red sash (''selendang'') and stamped batik pattern on the ''kain'' unique to ''Dharma Wanita''. The late Indonesian first lady and also a minor aristocrat [[Tien Suharto]] was a prominent advocate of the ''kebaya''.\n\nFormer President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] is a public champion of ''kebaya'' and wears fine red ''kebaya'' whenever possible in public forums and 2009 Presidential election debates.\n\n==Modern usage and innovations==\n[[File:Garuda Indonesia Flight Attendants New Costumes 2010 Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendant uniform in kebaya and kain [[batik]].]]\n\nKebaya has been one of the important parts of oriental style of clothing that heavily influenced the world of modern fashion. Lace dresses are one of the best examples of Kebaya influence.\n\nApart from traditional kebaya, fashion designers are looking into ways of modifying the design and making kebaya a more fashionable outfit. Casual designed kebaya can even be worn with jeans or skirts. For weddings or formal events, many designers are exploring other types of fine fabrics like laces to create a bridal kebaya.\n\nModern-day kebaya now incorporate modern tailoring innovations such as clasps, zippers and buttons zippers, being a much appreciated addition for ladies' that promptly need a toilet break, without requiring being literally unwrapped by a helper\u2014to the extent the true traditional kain is near unanimously rejected. Other modern innovations have included the blouse ''baju kebaya'' worn without the restrictive kemben, and even the kebaya blouse worn with slacks or made of the fabric usually for the ''kain panjang''.

For the majority of [[World War II]] in Europe, he was the chief of the [[Gestapo]], the secret state police of [[Nazi Germany]]. M\u00fcller was central in the planning and execution of the [[Holocaust]] and attended the January 1942 [[Wannsee Conference]], which formalised plans for deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe\u2014The \"[[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\". He was known as \"Gestapo M\u00fcller\" to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich M\u00fcller.\n\nHe was last seen in the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' in [[Berlin]] on 1 May 1945 and remains the most senior figure of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime who was never captured or confirmed to have died.\n\n==Early life and career==\nM\u00fcller was born in [[Munich]] on 28 April 1900 to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents. His father had been a rural police official.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=55}} M\u00fcller attended a ''Volkshochschule'' and completed an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic before the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=39}} During the last year of the war, he served in the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' as a pilot for an artillery spotting unit, he was decorated several times for bravery (including the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class, [[Military Merit Cross (Bavaria)|Bavarian Military Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords]] and Bavarian Pilots Badge). After the war ended, he joined the Bavarian Police in 1919 as an auxiliary worker.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=39\u201340}} Although not a member of the ''[[Freikorps]]'', he was involved in the suppression of the communist risings in the early post-war years. After witnessing the shooting of hostages by the revolutionary \"Red Army\" in Munich during the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], he acquired a lifelong hatred of [[communism]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} During the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] he was head of the Munich Political Police Department, having risen quickly through the ranks due to his spirited efforts.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=55}}\n\n==SS career==\nIt was under these auspices that he became acquainted with many members of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) including [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], although M\u00fcller in the Weimar period was generally seen as a supporter of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] (which at that time ruled Bavaria). On 9 March 1933, during the Nazi ''putsch'' that deposed the Bavarian government of Minister-President [[Heinrich Held]], M\u00fcller advocated to his superiors using force against the Nazis.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} Ironically, these views aided M\u00fcller's rise as it guaranteed the hostility of the Nazis, thereby making M\u00fcller very dependent upon the patronage of Reinhard Heydrich, who in turn appreciated M\u00fcller's professionalism and skill as a policeman, and was aware of M\u00fcller's past.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} Once the Nazis seized power, M\u00fcller's knowledge of communist activities placed him in high demand; as a result he was promoted to ''Polizeiobersekret\u00e4r'' in May 1933 and again to Criminal Inspector in November 1933.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=40}}\n\nHistorian [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote: \"M\u00fcller was a stickler for duty and discipline, and approached the tasks he was set as if they were military commands. A true [[workaholic]] who never took a vacation, M\u00fcller was determined to serve the German state, irrespective of what political form it took, and believed that it was everyone's duty, including his own, to obey its dictates without question.\"{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} Evans also records that M\u00fcller was a regime functionary out of ambition, not out of a belief in National Socialism: An internal [Nazi] Party memorandum&nbsp;... could not understand how \"so odious an opponent of the movement\" could become head of the Gestapo, especially since he had once referred to Hitler as \"an immigrant unemployed house painter\" and \"an Austrian draft-dodger\".{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} Nazi jurist and former police chief, ''SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Werner Best]] opined that M\u00fcller represented one of the \"finest examples\" of the limited connection between members of the NSDAP and the police before 1933.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=50}}\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power in 1933, Heydrich, as head of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|Security Service]] (SD), recruited M\u00fcller, [[Franz Josef Huber]] and [[Josef Albert Meisinger]], who were collectively referred to as the \"Bajuwaren-Brigade\" (Bavarian Brigade).{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=76}} M\u00fcller joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1934. By 1936, with Heydrich head of the Gestapo, M\u00fcller was its operations chief.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=132}}\n\nOn 4 January 1937, an evaluation by the Nazi Party's Deputy ''Gauleiter'' of Munich-Upper Bavaria stated:\n\n{{quote|Criminal Police Chief Inspector Heinrich M\u00fcller is not a Party member. He has also never actively worked within the Party or in one of its ancillary organisations&nbsp;...\n\nBefore the seizure of power M\u00fcller was employed in the political department of the Police Headquarters. He did his duty both under the direction of the notorious Police President Koch [Julius Koch, the Munich Police President 1929\u201333], and under Nortz and Mantel. His sphere of activity was to supervise and deal with the left-wing movement&nbsp;... [H]e fought against it very hard, sometimes in fact ignoring legal provisions and regulations&nbsp;... But it is equally clear that,&nbsp;... M\u00fcller would have acted against the Right in just the same way. With his enormous ambition and his marked 'pushiness' he would win the approval of his superiors&nbsp;... In terms of his political opinions&nbsp;... his standpoint varied between the German National People's Party and the Bavarian People's Party. But he was by no means a National Socialist.\n\nAs far as his qualities of character are concerned, these are regarded in an even poorer light than his political ones. He is ruthless,&nbsp;... and continually tries to demonstrate his efficiency, but claims all the glory for himself.\n\nIn his choice of officials for the Bavarian Political Police he was very concerned to propose either officials who were more junior than himself or only those who were inferior in ability&nbsp;... In this way he could keep rivals at bay. In his choice of officials he did not take account of political considerations, he only had his own egoistical aims in mind&nbsp;...\nThe ''Gau'' leadership of Munich-Upper Bavaria cannot, therefore, recommend accelerated promotion for M\u00fcller because he has rendered no services to the National Uprising.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} }}\n\nThis assessment did not deter Heydrich from moving M\u00fcller along the ranks, particularly since Heydrich believed it was an advantage not to be bound to the influence of the NSDAP.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=56}} Functionaries like M\u00fcller were the sort of men Heydrich preferred since they were inherently committed to their \"area of responsibility\" and correspondingly justified any steps they deemed necessary against perceived enemies of the Nazi \"racial community.\"{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=75}} M\u00fcller was promoted to the rank of ''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' (colonel) in 1937.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=606}} Engrossing himself often in red-tape and statistics, M\u00fcller was a natural administrator who took solace in a \"world of notes, memos, and regulations\" and then received and transformed Gestapo reports of denouncements, torture, and secret executions into \"administrative fodder.\"{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=145}} Despite the expense of so much mental energy in carrying out his duties, M\u00fcller disliked the scholarly types and once told [[Walter Schellenberg]] that \"intellectuals should be sent down a coal mine and blown up.\"{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=146}}\n\nBritish author and translator [[Edward Crankshaw]] described M\u00fcller as \"the arch-type non-political functionary\" who was \"in love with personal power and dedicated to the service of authority, the State.\"{{sfn|Crankshaw|2002|p=96}} General [[Walter Dornberger]], the chief over the rocket research at Peenem\u00fcnde, (under alleged Gestapo suspicion) was one of the few to ever interview with M\u00fcller and characterized him as, \"the unobtrusive type of police official who leaves no personal impression on the memory\" but added, \"...&nbsp;all I could remember was a pair of piercing grey-blue eyes, fixed on me with an unwavering scrutiny. My first impression was one of cold curiosity and extreme reserve.\"{{sfn|Crankshaw|2002|p=97}} American journalist and war correspondent, [[William L. Shirer]], called M\u00fcller a \"a dapper-looking fellow\" but shortly thereafter described him as \"a cold, dispassionate killer\".{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=953}}\n\nHimmler biographer Peter Padfield wrote: \"he [M\u00fcller] was an archetypal middle rank official: of limited imagination, non-political, non-ideological, his only fanaticism lay in an inner drive to perfection in his profession and in his duty to the state\u2014which in his mind were one&nbsp;... A smallish man with piercing eyes and thin lips, he was an able organiser, utterly ruthless, a man who lived for his work.\"{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=145}} Such was his dedication to the job that [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] Commandant [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] claimed that one could reach M\u00fcller \"any time of the day or night, even Sundays and public holidays.\"{{sfn|Dederichs|2008|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0126, Berlin, Besuch der ungarischen Polizeiabordnung.jpg|thumb|225px|Berlin February 1939: Maj. v.

As Gellately relates, such a politically-oriented asseveration certainly indicates M\u00fcller did indeed have preferences.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=61}} He was notorious, for instance, for admiring the Soviet police.{{sfn|Parrish|Marshall|1978|p=418}}\n\nWhile the chief of the subsequent Reich [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]]{{Efn|[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] had ordered the creation of the office on 24 January 1939.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=160}} }} was indeed Heydrich, it was M\u00fcller who took care of the office's administrative details.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=160}} Shortly thereafter, M\u00fcller took charge of this office but then handed control over to [[Adolf Eichmann]]. Once the war began, this ended the possibility of Jewish emigration and caused the office's dissolution.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1985|p=105}}\n\n==Gestapo chief==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98680, Besprechung Himmler mit M\u00fcller, Heydrich, Nebe, Huber2.jpg|thumb|320px|Left to right: [[Franz Josef Huber]], [[Arthur Nebe]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and M\u00fcller (1939)]]\n\nIn September 1939, when the Gestapo and other police organizations were consolidated under Heydrich into the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), M\u00fcller was made chief of the RSHA \"Amt IV\" (Office or Dept. 4): [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=469, 470}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|page=131}} To distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich M\u00fcller, he became known as \"Gestapo M\u00fcller\".{{sfn|Crankshaw|2002|p=94}}{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1985|p=81}}\n\nAs Gestapo chief of operations and later (September 1939 forward) head of the organization, M\u00fcller played a leading role in the detection and suppression of all forms of resistance to the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=131\u2013132, 141\u2013142}} Trusted by both Heydrich and Himmler, M\u00fcller was pivotal in making the Gestapo the \"central executive organ of National Socialist terror\" according to historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=20}} Under his leadership, the Gestapo succeeded in infiltrating and to a large extent, destroying groups opposed to the Nazis, such as the underground networks of the left-wing [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=182\u2013185}}{{sfn|Seeger|1996|pp=78\u201379}} Along these lines, historian George C.

During one of the operations, the clandestine [[Gleiwitz incident|mission to a German radio station on the Polish border]],{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=440}} M\u00fcller helped collect a dozen or so condemned men from camps, who were then dressed in Polish uniforms.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=174}} In exchange for their participation, the men were told by M\u00fcller that \"they would be pardoned and released.\"{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=174\u2013175}} Instead, the men were given a lethal injection and gunshot wounds to make them appear to have been killed in action during a fake attack.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=175}} These incidents (particularly the staged attack on the Gleiwitz radio station) were then used in [[Nazi propaganda]] to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of [[World War II]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=606}}{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=518\u2013520}}\n\n[[File:Fo30141711030060-2 Bekransning p\u00e5 \u00e6reskirkeg\u00e5rden p\u00e5 Ekeberg september 1941 Heydrich.jpg|thumb| M\u00fcller (front row, to the left) and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] visiting a war cemetery in Oslo, Norway in 1941. <br />]]\nThereafter, M\u00fcller continued to rise quickly through the ranks of the SS: in October 1939 he became an SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'', in November 1941 \u2013 ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' and Lieutenant General of the police. During the Second World War, M\u00fcller was heavily involved in [[espionage]] and [[counter-espionage]], particularly since the Nazi regime increasingly distrusted the military intelligence service\u2014the ''[[Abwehr]]''\u2014which under Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was a hotbed of activity for the [[German Resistance]]. In 1942 he successfully infiltrated the \"[[Red Orchestra (spy)|Red Orchestra]]\" network of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies and used it to feed false information to the Soviet intelligence services.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=145, 146}}\n\nHeydrich was M\u00fcller's direct superior until his assassination in 1942. For the remainder of the war, [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] took over as M\u00fcller's superior.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}} M\u00fcller occupied a position in the Nazi hierarchy close to Himmler, the overall head of the Nazi police apparatus and the chief architect of the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, and Eichmann, the man entrusted with arranging the deportations of Jews to the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] ghettoes and death camps. Eichmann headed the Gestapo's \"Office of Resettlement\", and then its \"Office of Jewish Affairs\" (the RSHA Amt IV sub-section known as [[Reich Security Head Office Referat IV B4|Referat IV B4]]). He was M\u00fcller's subordinate.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=145}} M\u00fcller was also involved in the regime's policy towards the [[Jew]]s, although Himmler and Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] drove this area of policy. On 6 October 1939 for instance, M\u00fcller instructed Eichmann to prepare for the deportation of some 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the annexed Polish city of Kattowitz; an order which included the deportation of the Jews from Ostrava\u2014both \"expulsion campaigns\" had already been planned as early as September by the Gestapo or the army.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=151}} Twelve days later on 18 October 1939, he told Eichmann that it would soon \"be necessary to organize the resettlement and removal of Poles and Jews into the area of the future Polish rump state centrally\" via the RSHA.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAlthough his chief responsibility was always police work within Germany, he was fully in charge and thus responsible to execute the extermination of the Jews of Europe. When Eichmann reported to M\u00fcller sometime in the middle of 1941 that he had been informed by Himmler that the F\u00fchrer had ordered the physical destruction of the Jews for instance, M\u00fcller silently nodded at his desk, indicating to Eichmann that he already knew.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=164}} Correspondingly, M\u00fcller received detailed reports from Eichmann about the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' death-squad units, which according to historian [[Raul Hilberg]] killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews between 1941 and 1945.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} At the end of June 1941, M\u00fcller dispatched Eichmann to Minsk, so he could collect detailed information on the execution activities.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|pp=166\u2013168}} In August 1941, M\u00fcller ordered that these killing reports be forwarded to Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=240\u2013241}} Attempting to keep the brutality of the wholesale slaughter occurring in the East as quiet as possible, M\u00fcller sent a telegram to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' towards the end of August 1941, which explicitly instructed them \"to prevent the crowding of spectators during the mass executions.\"{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=371}} On 23 October 1941, M\u00fcller briefed a circular to SiPo stations which exclusively prohibited any future Jewish emigration out of German controlled territory, a directive which presaged their imminent extermination.{{sfn|Krausnick|1968|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nIn January 1942, he attended the [[Wannsee Conference]] at which Heydrich briefed senior officials from a number of government departments of the extermination plan, and at which Eichmann took the minutes.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=263\u2013267}} Once the conference concluded, M\u00fcller, Heydrich, and Eichmann remained afterwards for additional \"informal chats\".{{sfn|Graber|1978|pp=200\u2013201}}{{Efn|There are also reports that afterwards the three of them enjoyed \"a glass or two or three of cognac.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=216}} }} Just a couple months later in March 1942, Jews were already being systematically killed in [[gas vans]] at [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chelmno]] and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] while construction was underway at [[Birkenau concentration camp|Birkenau]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=310}} Again, M\u00fcller sent Eichmann to relate his findings about the killing operations taking place at Chelmno; when Eichmann returned this time, he reported to M\u00fcller that the scene was \"horrible\" and added it was \"an indescribable inferno.\"{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|pp=310\u2013311}} When the first denunciations of the mass murder being carried-out by the Germans hit the Allied press during the autumn and winter of 1942, Himmler instructed M\u00fcller to ensure that \"all the bodies were either buried or burned.\"{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=409}}\n\nEnforcement and administration of Nazi \"racial-hygiene\" policies were also within the purview of M\u00fcller's responsibilities, as a special letter he sent from Berlin to all Gestapo offices on 10 March 1942 reveals; the letter contained instructions concerning the relationship between German women and Polish civilians or prisoners-of-war who were conscripted as labor during the war, particularly in cases related to pregnancy.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=234\u2013235}} If both parties proved \"racially acceptable\" and the Polish man wanted to marry the woman, the pregnancy and relationship was allowed without punitive consequences, provided the RSHA approved after photographic evaluation of both parties and subsequent \"Germanization\" of the Pole occurred. For cases where one or more parties was deemed racially unfit, the Polish male would receive \"special handling\", an obvious Nazi euphemism for a death-sentence.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=235}}\n\nIn May 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in [[Prague]] by [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] soldiers sent from [[London]]. M\u00fcller was sent to Prague to head the investigation into [[Operation Anthropoid|Operation \"Anthropoid\"]]. He succeeded through a combination of bribery and torture in locating the assassins, who killed themselves to avoid capture. Despite this success, his influence within the regime declined somewhat with the loss of his original patron, Heydrich. Nonetheless, between the time Heydrich died in 1942 and Kaltenbrunner took office in January 1943, \"M\u00fcller played a central role in the organization of the [[Holocaust]].\"{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=40\u201341}}{{Efn|Historian Klaus Fischer refers to M\u00fcller as a \"key figure in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=336}} }}{{Efn|Despite his humble origins as a police official, historian George C. Browder avows that M\u00fcller, \"went on to become a chief executive of genocide and every extreme of inhumanity, without displaying any pleasure or lust for blood.\"{{sfn|Browder|1996|p=41}} }} Evidence of M\u00fcller's intimate involvement in the Holocaust are abundant in some of the surviving documents and in the later testimony of Eichmann, who divulged that he remained in constant contact with M\u00fcller.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=169}} Eichmann recalled how M\u00fcller reserved power unto himself and that while he (Eichmann), arranged plenty of deportations, it was only M\u00fcller who could write the total number of Jews (in his orange-colored pencil) who were transported at the top of the corresponding reports.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=169\u2013170}}{{Efn|According to Eichmann, M\u00fcller conducted weekly meeting with his \"specialists\" on Thursdays where they would frequently discuss \"business\" along with personal affairs. Chess games were a routine part of these meetings with Eichmann reporting that M\u00fcller always won.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=170}} }}\n\nAs the [[Red Army]] counteroffensive against the Germans arrayed at Stalingrad in mid-November 1942 started to take its toll, the exigencies of war demanded an increase in arms production; M\u00fcller played his part by responding to and facilitating Himmler's request for an additional 35,000\u201340,000 forced laborers.{{sfn|Mayer|2012|p=334}} The Gestapo Chief rounded them up from across detention centers and prisons which were not yet part of the concentration camp system and sent them to [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].{{sfn|Mayer|2012|pp=334\u2013335}} Sometime in 1943, M\u00fcller was sent to Rome to pressure the Italian government to cooperate in relinquishing their Jews for deportation.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=226}}{{sfn|Bauer|1982|pp=236\u2013237}} Despite having the apparent support of Mussolini, M\u00fcller's efforts were not very successful as influential Jewish figures within Italy were in contact with the police and the military; they successfully appealed to their (Italians and Jews) shared religious convictions and convinced them to resist Nazi pressure.{{sfn|Bauer|1982|p=237}} In 1943 M\u00fcller had differences with Himmler over what to do with the growing evidence of a resistance network within the German state apparatus, particularly the ''Abwehr'' and the Foreign Office. He presented Himmler with firm evidence during February 1943, that [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was involved with the resistance; however, Himmler told him to drop the case.{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=422}} Offended by this, M\u00fcller became an ally of [[Martin Bormann]], the head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]], who was Himmler's main rival.{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=427}}\n\nAccording to the SiPo and SD official in Denmark, Rudolf Mildner, Gestapo Chief M\u00fcller instructed him \"to arrest the Nobel Prize\u2013winning atomic physicist [[Niels Bohr]]\" sometime during the fall of 1943; this was likely the consequence of Bohr being half-Jewish, but his scientific significance also interested officials in Berlin.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|pp=34, 38}} Fortunately for Bohr, he was tipped off by a sympathetic German woman working for the Gestapo and was able to escape across the Kattegat Strait into Sweden. Later, Mildner conveniently asserted during Allied questioning that he had disobeyed M\u00fcller's order and allowed Bohr to get to safety.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|p=38}}\n\nEarly in 1944, M\u00fcller issued the Nazi injunction known as the \"cartridge directive\"; this command stipulated that Soviet prisoners-of-war who had assisted in the identification of detained political commissars for the purpose of their liquidation also be executed on the grounds that they were ''Geheimnistr\u00e4ger'' (bearers of secrets).{{sfn|Grunberger|1993|p=99}} Instructions like these amid the numerous other crimes committed at his command made M\u00fcller \"one of the most feared officials in Europe\" during the Nazi reign.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=334}}\n\nAfter the [[20 July Plot|assassination attempt]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] on 20 July 1944, M\u00fcller was placed in charge of the arrest and interrogation of all those suspected of involvement in the resistance. Over 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 executed, including Canaris. Not long after the anti-Nazi resisters were sadistically killed, M\u00fcller allegedly exclaimed, \"We won't make the same mistake as in 1918. We won't leave our internal German enemies alive.\"{{sfn|Fritz|2011|p=454}} In the last months of the war, M\u00fcller remained at his post, apparently still confident of a German victory \u2014 he told one of his officers in December 1944 that the [[Ardennes offensive]] would result in the recapture of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\n==Berlin 1945==\nIn April 1945, he was among the last group of Nazi loyalists assembled in the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' in central [[Berlin]] as the Red Army fought its way into the city. One of his last tasks was the sharp interrogation of [[Hermann Fegelein]] in the cellar of the [[Holy Trinity Church (Berlin)|Church of the Trinity]] as to what he knew of Himmler's attempted peace negotiations with the western allies behind Hitler's back.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=341\u2013343}} Fegelein was Himmler's SS liaison officer and was shot after Hitler had Himmler expelled from all his posts for the betrayal.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=267, 270\u2013271, 277, 278}} Hitler's secretary, [[Traudl Junge]], recounted seeing M\u00fcller on 22 April 1945 and claimed she saw him on occasion chatting with Hitler in the bunker; she also added that he (M\u00fcller) had assumed Kaltenbrunner's former duties as head of the RSHA.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|p=7}} Both Junge and ''[[Oberscharf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Rochus Misch]], the telephone operator for the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', recalled seeing M\u00fcller on 30 April 1945.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Misch|2014|pp=170\u2013171}} Misch placed him in the Reich Chancellery still in full uniform.{{sfn|Misch|2014|pp=170\u2013171}} That afternoon, Hitler [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]].{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=160\u2013182}} On 2 May 1945, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, General [[Helmuth Weidling]], surrendered to the Red Army.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=386}}\n\n===Disappearance===\nM\u00fcller was last seen in the bunker on the evening of 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler's suicide.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} [[Hans Baur]], Hitler's pilot, later quoted M\u00fcller as saying; \"we know the Russian methods exactly. I haven't the faintest intention of being taken prisoner by the Russians.\" From that day onwards, no trace of him has ever been found. He is the most senior member of the Nazi regime whose fate remains a mystery. However, the best evidence points to him either having been killed or committing suicide during the chaos of the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]], and his body, if recovered, was not identified.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=412}}\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) file on M\u00fcller was released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] in 2001, and documents several unsuccessful attempts by U.S. agencies to find M\u00fcller. The [[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]] commentary on the file concludes: \"Though inconclusive on M\u00fcller's ultimate fate, the file is very clear on one point. The Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessors did not know M\u00fcller's whereabouts at any point after the war. In other words, the CIA was never in contact with M\u00fcller.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} The CIA file shows that an extensive search was made for M\u00fcller in the months after the German surrender. The search was led by the counterespionage branch of the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]] (forerunner of the CIA). The search was complicated by the fact that \"Heinrich M\u00fcller\" is a very common German name. A further problem arose because \"some of these M\u00fcllers, including Gestapo M\u00fcller, did not appear to have middle names. An additional source of confusion was that there were two different SS generals named Heinrich M\u00fcller.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nIn 1947, American and British agents searched the home of his wartime mistress Anna Schmid, but found nothing suggesting that he was still alive. With the onset of the [[Cold War]] and the shift of priorities to meeting the challenge of the Soviet Union, interest in pursuing missing Nazis declined. By this time, the conclusion seems to have been reached that M\u00fcller was most likely dead. The [[Royal Air Force]] [[Special Investigation Branch]] also had an interest in M\u00fcller with regard to the [[Stalag Luft III murders]], for which he was presumed to have responsibility given his position in the Gestapo.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe seizure in 1960 and subsequent trial in [[Israel]] of [[Adolf Eichmann]] sparked new interest in M\u00fcller's whereabouts. Although Eichmann revealed no specific information, he told his Israeli interrogators that he believed that M\u00fcller was still alive. The West German office in charge of the prosecution of war criminals charged the police to investigate. The possibility that M\u00fcller was working for the Soviet Union was considered, but no definite information was gained. M\u00fcller's family and his former secretary were placed under surveillance by the Allies in case he was corresponding with them.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe West Germans investigated several reports of M\u00fcller's body being found and buried in the days after the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]]. The reports were contradictory, not wholly reliable and it was not possible to confirm any of them. One such report came from Walter L\u00fcders, a former member of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', who said that he had been part of a burial unit which had found the body of an SS general in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, with the identity papers of Heinrich M\u00fcller. The body had been buried in a mass grave at the old Jewish Cemetery on Grosse Hamburger Strasse in the Soviet Sector. Since this location was in [[East Berlin]] in 1961, this gravesite could not be investigated, nor has there been any attempt to excavate this gravesite since the [[reunification of Germany]].{{sfnp|Smale|2013}}\n\nIn 1961, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Michael Goleniewski]], the Deputy Chief of Polish Military Counter Intelligence, defected to the West. Goleniewski had worked as an interrogator of captured German officials from 1948 to 1952. He never met M\u00fcller, but said he had heard from his Soviet supervisors that sometime between 1950 and 1952, the Soviets had \"picked up M\u00fcller and taken him to Moscow\". The CIA tried to track down the men Goleniewski named as having worked with M\u00fcller in Moscow, but were unable to confirm his story.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} Israel also continued to pursue M\u00fcller: in 1967, two Israeli operatives were caught by West German police attempting to break into the Munich apartment of M\u00fcller's wife.{{Efn|Frischauer, Willi (16 November 1967), \"This Man Mueller,\" ''Evening Standard'', Issue: 44603.}}\n\nIn 1967, in [[Panama City]], a man named Francis Willard Keith was accused of being M\u00fcller. West German diplomats pressed [[Panama]] to extradite him for trial. West German prosecutors said Sophie M\u00fcller, 64, had seen photos of Keith and identified him as her long-missing husband. However, Keith was released once fingerprints proved he was not M\u00fcller.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe CIA investigation concluded: \"There is little room for doubt that the Soviet and Czechoslovak [intelligence] services circulated rumors to the effect that M\u00fcller had escaped to the West&nbsp;... to offset the charges that the Soviets had sheltered the criminal&nbsp;... There are strong indications but no proof that M\u00fcller collaborated with [the Soviets]. There are also strong indications but no proof that M\u00fcller died [in Berlin].\" The CIA apparently remained convinced at that time that if M\u00fcller had survived the war, he was being harboured within the Soviet Union. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Soviet archives were opened, no evidence to support this belief emerged.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} The U.S. National Archives commentary concludes: \"More information about M\u00fcller's fate might still emerge from still secret files of the former Soviet Union. The CIA file, by itself, does not permit definitive conclusions. Taking into account the currently available records, the authors of this report conclude that M\u00fcller most likely died in Berlin in early May 1945.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} By the 1990s, it was in any case increasingly unlikely that M\u00fcller, who was born in 1900, was alive even if he had survived the war.\n\nIn 2008, historian [[Peter Longerich]] published a biography of Heinrich Himmler, which appeared in English translation in 2012. Longerich asserts that M\u00fcller was with Himmler at [[Flensburg]] on 11 May, and accompanied Himmler and other SS officers in their unsuccessful attempt to escape capture by the Allies and reach Bavaria on foot. Longerich states that Himmler and M\u00fcller parted company at Meinstadt, after which M\u00fcller was not seen again.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=735}} Longerich provides no source for this claim, which contradicts previous accounts of M\u00fcller's disappearance. The source for Longerich's account appears to be the interrogation of one of Himmler's adjutants, [[Werner Grothmann]], the transcript of which contains references to \"M\u00fcller\".{{Efn|A facsimile of part of the relevant transcript appears at this German website: http://file1.npage.de/003951/70/html/ripper4.html}}\n\nIn 2013 Johannes Tuchel, the head of the [[Memorial to the German Resistance]], claimed M\u00fcller's body was found in August 1945 by a work crew cleaning up corpses and was one of 3,000 buried in a mass grave on the site of a former Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte. While Tuchel was confident that he had solved the mystery, whether M\u00fcller is actually there has not been confirmed.{{sfnp|Brown|2013}} Nonetheless, the uncertainty of M\u00fcller's ultimate end and/or whereabouts has only served to nourish the \"mysterious power\" that the Gestapo elicits even to the present.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nWalter Schellenberg alleged in his memoir that Muller had defected to the Soviets in 1945. Schellenberg wrote that in 1950 a German officer who had been a prisoner of war in Russia stated that he had seen Muller in Moscow in 1948 and that he had died shortly afterward. There is no reference in the memoir as to who the German officer was or any other details that might help verify this claim.{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=321}}\n\n=== Falsified M\u00fcller CIC dossier ===\nIn July 1988 author [[Ian Sayer]] received, from an anonymous individual, a 427-page (photocopied) [[US Army Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) file that claimed it had been inadvertently released by the US National Archives. The dossier purported to confirm that Heinrich M\u00fcller had survived the war and been retained by the CIC as an intelligence adviser.{{Sfn|Sayer|Botting|1989|pp=333\u2013335}}\n\nSayer and co-author [[Douglas Botting]] were known to be working on a comprehensive history of the [[US Army Counter Intelligence Corps|US Army's Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) at that time. The alleged dossier had also come to the attention of the US Department of Justice's Nazi hunting unit, the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]], who subsequently sought Sayer's opinion on the veracity of the documents. By this time the anonymous individual (later identified as Gregory Douglas) had managed to interest [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] and the ''[[The Times|London Times]]'' newspaper in his story.{{sfn|Whiting|2001|p=133 et seq}} However, the dossier claims and associated materials were found to be

1945){{sfn|Weale|2010|p=412}}{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=285}} was a high-ranking German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and police official during the [[Nazi era]]. For the majority of [[World War II]] in Europe, he was the chief of the [[Gestapo]], the secret state police of [[Nazi Germany]]. M\u00fcller was central in the planning and execution of the [[Holocaust]] and attended the January 1942 [[Wannsee Conference]], which formalised plans for deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe\u2014The \"[[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\". He was known as \"Gestapo M\u00fcller\" to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich M\u00fcller.\n\nHe was last seen in the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' in [[Berlin]] on 1 May 1945 and remains the most senior figure of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime who was never captured or confirmed to have died.\n\n==Early life==\nM\u00fcller was born in [[Munich]] on 28 April 1900 to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents. His father had been a rural police official.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=55}} M\u00fcller attended a ''Volkshochschule'' and completed an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic before the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=39}} During the final year of WWI, he served in the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' as a pilot for an artillery spotting unit, he was decorated several times for bravery (including the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class, [[Military Merit Cross (Bavaria)|Bavarian Military Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords]] and Bavarian Pilots Badge). After the war ended, he joined the Bavarian Police in 1919 as an auxiliary worker.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=39\u201340}} Although not a member of the ''[[Freikorps]]'', he was involved in the suppression of the communist risings in the early post-war years. After witnessing the shooting of hostages by the revolutionary \"Red Army\" in Munich during the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], he acquired a lifelong hatred of [[communism]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} During the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] he was head of the Munich Political Police Department, having risen quickly through the ranks due to his spirited efforts.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=55}}\n\n==SS career==\nIt was under these auspices that he became acquainted with many members of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) including [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], although M\u00fcller in the Weimar period was generally seen as a supporter of the [[Bavarian People's Party]] (which at that time ruled Bavaria). On 9 March 1933, during the Nazi ''putsch'' that deposed the Bavarian government of Minister-President [[Heinrich Held]], M\u00fcller advocated to his superiors using force against the Nazis.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} Ironically, these views aided M\u00fcller's rise as it guaranteed the hostility of the Nazis, thereby making M\u00fcller very dependent upon the patronage of Reinhard Heydrich, who in turn appreciated M\u00fcller's professionalism and skill as a policeman, and was aware of M\u00fcller's past.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} Once the Nazis seized power, M\u00fcller's knowledge of communist activities placed him in high demand; as a result he was promoted to ''Polizeiobersekret\u00e4r'' in May 1933 and again to Criminal Inspector in November 1933.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=40}}\n\nHistorian [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote: \"M\u00fcller was a stickler for duty and discipline, and approached the tasks he was set as if they were military commands. A true [[workaholic]] who never took a vacation, M\u00fcller was determined to serve the German state, irrespective of what political form it took, and believed that it was everyone's duty, including his own, to obey its dictates without question.\"{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} Evans also records that M\u00fcller was a regime functionary out of ambition, not out of a belief in National Socialism: An internal [Nazi] Party memorandum&nbsp;... could not understand how \"so odious an opponent of the movement\" could become head of the Gestapo, especially since he had once referred to Hitler as \"an immigrant unemployed house painter\" and \"an Austrian draft-dodger\".{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=97}} Nazi jurist and former police chief, ''SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Werner Best]] opined that M\u00fcller represented one of the \"finest examples\" of the limited connection between members of the NSDAP and the police before 1933.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=50}}\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power in 1933, Heydrich, as head of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|Security Service]] (SD), recruited M\u00fcller, [[Franz Josef Huber]] and [[Josef Albert Meisinger]], who were collectively referred to as the \"Bajuwaren-Brigade\" (Bavarian Brigade).{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=76}} M\u00fcller joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1934. By 1936, with Heydrich head of the Gestapo, M\u00fcller was its operations chief.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=132}}\n\nOn 4 January 1937, an evaluation by the Nazi Party's Deputy ''Gauleiter'' of Munich-Upper Bavaria stated:\n\n{{quote|Criminal Police Chief Inspector Heinrich M\u00fcller is not a Party member. He has also never actively worked within the Party or in one of its ancillary organisations&nbsp;...\n\nBefore the seizure of power M\u00fcller was employed in the political department of the Police Headquarters. He did his duty both under the direction of the notorious Police President Koch [Julius Koch, the Munich Police President 1929\u201333], and under Nortz and Mantel. His sphere of activity was to supervise and deal with the left-wing movement&nbsp;... [H]e fought against it very hard, sometimes in fact ignoring legal provisions and regulations&nbsp;... But it is equally clear that,&nbsp;... M\u00fcller would have acted against the Right in just the same way. With his enormous ambition and his marked 'pushiness' he would win the approval of his superiors&nbsp;... In terms of his political opinions&nbsp;... his standpoint varied between the German National People's Party and the Bavarian People's Party. But he was by no means a National Socialist.\n\nAs far as his qualities of character are concerned, these are regarded in an even poorer light than his political ones. He is ruthless,&nbsp;... and continually tries to demonstrate his efficiency, but claims all the glory for himself.\n\nIn his choice of officials for the Bavarian Political Police he was very concerned to propose either officials who were more junior than himself or only those who were inferior in ability&nbsp;... In this way he could keep rivals at bay. In his choice of officials he did not take account of political considerations, he only had his own egoistical aims in mind&nbsp;...\nThe ''Gau'' leadership of Munich-Upper Bavaria cannot, therefore, recommend accelerated promotion for M\u00fcller because he has rendered no services to the National Uprising.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|pp=500\u2013501}} }}\n\nThis assessment did not deter Heydrich from moving M\u00fcller along the ranks, particularly since Heydrich believed it was an advantage not to be bound to the influence of the NSDAP.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=56}} Functionaries like M\u00fcller were the sort of men Heydrich preferred since they were inherently committed to their \"area of responsibility\" and correspondingly justified any steps they deemed necessary against perceived enemies of the Nazi \"racial community.\"{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=75}} M\u00fcller was promoted to the rank of ''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' (colonel) in 1937.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=606}} Engrossing himself often in red-tape and statistics, M\u00fcller was a natural administrator who took solace in a \"world of notes, memos, and regulations\" and then received and transformed Gestapo reports of denouncements, torture, and secret executions into \"administrative fodder.\"{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=145}} Despite the expense of so much mental energy in carrying out his duties, M\u00fcller disliked the scholarly types and once told [[Walter Schellenberg]] that \"intellectuals should be sent down a coal mine and blown up.\"{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=146}}\n\nBritish author and translator [[Edward Crankshaw]] described M\u00fcller as \"the arch-type non-political functionary\" who was \"in love with personal power and dedicated to the service of authority, the State.\"{{sfn|Crankshaw|2002|p=96}} General [[Walter Dornberger]], the chief over the rocket research at Peenem\u00fcnde, (under alleged Gestapo suspicion) was one of the few to ever interview with M\u00fcller and characterized him as, \"the unobtrusive type of police official who leaves no personal impression on the memory\" but added, \"...&nbsp;all I could remember was a pair of piercing grey-blue eyes, fixed on me with an unwavering scrutiny. My first impression was one of cold curiosity and extreme reserve.\"{{sfn|Crankshaw|2002|p=97}} American journalist and war correspondent, [[William L. Shirer]], called M\u00fcller a \"a dapper-looking fellow\" but shortly thereafter described him as \"a cold, dispassionate killer\".{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=953}}\n\nHimmler biographer Peter Padfield wrote: \"he [M\u00fcller] was an archetypal middle rank official: of limited imagination, non-political, non-ideological, his only fanaticism lay in an inner drive to perfection in his profession and in his duty to the state\u2014which in his mind were one&nbsp;... A smallish man with piercing eyes and thin lips, he was an able organiser, utterly ruthless, a man who lived for his work.\"{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=145}} Such was his dedication to the job that [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] Commandant [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] claimed that one could reach M\u00fcller \"any time of the day or night, even Sundays and public holidays.\"{{sfn|Dederichs|2008|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0126, Berlin, Besuch der ungarischen Polizeiabordnung.jpg|thumb|225px|Berlin February 1939: Maj. v.

During the Second World War, M\u00fcller was heavily involved in [[espionage]] and [[counter-espionage]], particularly since the Nazi regime increasingly distrusted the military intelligence service\u2014the ''[[Abwehr]]''\u2014which under Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was a hotbed of activity for the [[German Resistance]]. In 1942 he successfully infiltrated the \"[[Red Orchestra (spy)|Red Orchestra]]\" network of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies and used it to feed false information to the Soviet intelligence services.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=145, 146}}\n\nHeydrich was M\u00fcller's direct superior until his assassination in 1942. For the remainder of the war, [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] took over as M\u00fcller's superior.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}} M\u00fcller occupied a position in the Nazi hierarchy close to Himmler, the overall head of the Nazi police apparatus and the chief architect of the plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, and Eichmann, the man entrusted with arranging the deportations of Jews to the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] ghettoes and death camps. Eichmann headed the Gestapo's \"Office of Resettlement\", and then its \"Office of Jewish Affairs\" (the RSHA Amt IV sub-section known as [[Reich Security Head Office Referat IV B4|Referat IV B4]]). He was M\u00fcller's subordinate.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=145}} M\u00fcller was also involved in the regime's policy towards the [[Jew]]s, although Himmler and Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] drove this area of policy. On 6 October 1939 for instance, M\u00fcller instructed Eichmann to prepare for the deportation of some 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the annexed Polish city of Kattowitz; an order which included the deportation of the Jews from Ostrava\u2014both \"expulsion campaigns\" had already been planned as early as September by the Gestapo or the army.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=151}} Twelve days later on 18 October 1939, he told Eichmann that it would soon \"be necessary to organize the resettlement and removal of Poles and Jews into the area of the future Polish rump state centrally\" via the RSHA.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\nAlthough his chief responsibility was always police work within Germany, he was fully in charge and thus responsible to execute the extermination of the Jews of Europe. When Eichmann reported to M\u00fcller sometime in the middle of 1941 that he had been informed by Himmler that the F\u00fchrer had ordered the physical destruction of the Jews for instance, M\u00fcller silently nodded at his desk, indicating to Eichmann that he already knew.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=164}} Correspondingly, M\u00fcller received detailed reports from Eichmann about the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' death-squad units, which according to historian [[Raul Hilberg]] killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews between 1941 and 1945.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} At the end of June 1941, M\u00fcller dispatched Eichmann to Minsk, so he could collect detailed information on the execution activities.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|pp=166\u2013168}} In August 1941, M\u00fcller ordered that these killing reports be forwarded to Hitler.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=240\u2013241}} Attempting to keep the brutality of the wholesale slaughter occurring in the East as quiet as possible, M\u00fcller sent a telegram to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' towards the end of August 1941, which explicitly instructed them \"to prevent the crowding of spectators during the mass executions.\"{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=371}} On 23 October 1941, M\u00fcller briefed a circular to SiPo stations which exclusively prohibited any future Jewish emigration out of German controlled territory, a directive which presaged their imminent extermination.{{sfn|Krausnick|1968|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nIn January 1942, he attended the [[Wannsee Conference]] at which Heydrich briefed senior officials from a number of government departments of the extermination plan, and at which Eichmann took the minutes.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=263\u2013267}} Once the conference concluded, M\u00fcller, Heydrich, and Eichmann remained afterwards for additional \"informal chats\".{{sfn|Graber|1978|pp=200\u2013201}}{{Efn|There are also reports that afterwards the three of them enjoyed \"a glass or two or three of cognac.\"{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=216}} }} Just a couple months later in March 1942, Jews were already being systematically killed in [[gas vans]] at [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chelmno]] and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] while construction was underway at [[Birkenau concentration camp|Birkenau]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=310}} Again, M\u00fcller sent Eichmann to relate his findings about the killing operations taking place at Chelmno; when Eichmann returned this time, he reported to M\u00fcller that the scene was \"horrible\" and added it was \"an indescribable inferno.\"{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|pp=310\u2013311}} When the first denunciations of the mass murder being carried-out by the Germans hit the Allied press during the autumn and winter of 1942, Himmler instructed M\u00fcller to ensure that \"all the bodies were either buried or burned.\"{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=409}}\n\nEnforcement and administration of Nazi \"racial-hygiene\" policies were also within the purview of M\u00fcller's responsibilities, as a special letter he sent from Berlin to all Gestapo offices on 10 March 1942 reveals; the letter contained instructions concerning the relationship between German women and Polish civilians or prisoners-of-war who were conscripted as labor during the war, particularly in cases related to pregnancy.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=234\u2013235}} If both parties proved \"racially acceptable\" and the Polish man wanted to marry the woman, the pregnancy and relationship was allowed without punitive consequences, provided the RSHA approved after photographic evaluation of both parties and subsequent \"Germanization\" of the Pole occurred. For cases where one or more parties was deemed racially unfit, the Polish male would receive \"special handling\", an obvious Nazi euphemism for a death-sentence.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=235}}\n\nIn May 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in [[Prague]] by [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] soldiers sent from [[London]]. M\u00fcller was sent to Prague to head the investigation into [[Operation Anthropoid|Operation \"Anthropoid\"]]. He succeeded through a combination of bribery and torture in locating the assassins, who killed themselves to avoid capture. Despite this success, his influence within the regime declined somewhat with the loss of his original patron, Heydrich. Nonetheless, between the time Heydrich died in 1942 and Kaltenbrunner took office in January 1943, \"M\u00fcller played a central role in the organization of the [[Holocaust]].\"{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=40\u201341}}{{Efn|Historian Klaus Fischer refers to M\u00fcller as a \"key figure in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=336}} }}{{Efn|Despite his humble origins as a police official, historian George C.

He presented Himmler with firm evidence during February 1943, that [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was involved with the resistance; however, Himmler told him to drop the case.{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=422}} Offended by this, M\u00fcller became an ally of [[Martin Bormann]], the head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]], who was Himmler's main rival.{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=427}}\n\nAccording to the SiPo and SD official in Denmark, Rudolf Mildner, Gestapo Chief M\u00fcller instructed him \"to arrest the Nobel Prize\u2013winning atomic physicist [[Niels Bohr]]\" sometime during the fall of 1943; this was likely the consequence of Bohr being half-Jewish, but his scientific significance also interested officials in Berlin.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|pp=34, 38}} Fortunately for Bohr, he was tipped off by a sympathetic German woman working for the Gestapo and was able to escape across the Kattegat Strait into Sweden. Later, Mildner conveniently asserted during Allied questioning that he had disobeyed M\u00fcller's order and allowed Bohr to get to safety.{{sfn|Breitman|Goda|2010|p=38}}\n\nEarly in 1944, M\u00fcller issued the Nazi injunction known as the \"cartridge directive\"; this command stipulated that Soviet prisoners-of-war who had assisted in the identification of detained political commissars for the purpose of their liquidation also be executed on the grounds that they were ''Geheimnistr\u00e4ger'' (bearers of secrets).{{sfn|Grunberger|1993|p=99}} Instructions like these amid the numerous other crimes committed at his command made M\u00fcller \"one of the most feared officials in Europe\" during the Nazi reign.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=334}}\n\nAfter the [[20 July Plot|assassination attempt]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] on 20 July 1944, M\u00fcller was placed in charge of the arrest and interrogation of all those suspected of involvement in the resistance. Over 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 executed, including Canaris. Not long after the anti-Nazi resisters were sadistically killed, M\u00fcller allegedly exclaimed, \"We won't make the same mistake as in 1918. We won't leave our internal German enemies alive.\"{{sfn|Fritz|2011|p=454}} In the last months of the war, M\u00fcller remained at his post, apparently still confident of a German victory \u2014 he told one of his officers in December 1944 that the [[Ardennes offensive]] would result in the recapture of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\n==Berlin 1945==\nIn April 1945, he was among the last group of Nazi loyalists assembled in the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' in central [[Berlin]] as the Red Army fought its way into the city.

I haven't the faintest intention of being taken prisoner by the Russians.\" From that day onwards, no trace of him has ever been found. He is the most senior member of the Nazi regime whose fate remains a mystery. However, the best evidence points to him either having been killed or committing suicide during the chaos of the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]], and his body, if recovered, was not identified.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=412}}\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) file on M\u00fcller was released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] in 2001, and documents several unsuccessful attempts by U.S. agencies to find M\u00fcller. The [[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]] commentary on the file concludes: \"Though inconclusive on M\u00fcller's ultimate fate, the file is very clear on one point. The Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessors did not know M\u00fcller's whereabouts at any point after the war. In other words, the CIA was never in contact with M\u00fcller.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} The CIA file shows that an extensive search was made for M\u00fcller in the months after the German surrender. The search was led by the counterespionage branch of the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]] (forerunner of the CIA). The search was complicated by the fact that \"Heinrich M\u00fcller\" is a very common German name. A further problem arose because \"some of these M\u00fcllers, including Gestapo M\u00fcller, did not appear to have middle names. An additional source of confusion was that there were two different SS generals named Heinrich M\u00fcller.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nIn 1947, American and British agents searched the home of his wartime mistress Anna Schmid, but found nothing suggesting that he was still alive. With the onset of the [[Cold War]] and the shift of priorities to meeting the challenge of the Soviet Union, interest in pursuing missing Nazis declined. By this time, the conclusion seems to have been reached that M\u00fcller was most likely dead. The [[Royal Air Force]] [[Special Investigation Branch]] also had an interest in M\u00fcller with regard to the [[Stalag Luft III murders]], for which he was presumed to have responsibility given his position in the Gestapo.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe seizure in 1960 and subsequent trial in [[Israel]] of [[Adolf Eichmann]] sparked new interest in M\u00fcller's whereabouts. Although Eichmann revealed no specific information, he told his Israeli interrogators that he believed that M\u00fcller was still alive. The West German office in charge of the prosecution of war criminals charged the police to investigate. The possibility that M\u00fcller was working for the Soviet Union was considered, but no definite information was gained. M\u00fcller's family and his former secretary were placed under surveillance by the Allies in case he was corresponding with them.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe West Germans investigated several reports of M\u00fcller's body being found and buried in the days after the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]]. The reports were contradictory, not wholly reliable and it was not possible to confirm any of them. One such report came from Walter L\u00fcders, a former member of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', who said that he had been part of a burial unit which had found the body of an SS general in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, with the identity papers of Heinrich M\u00fcller. The body had been buried in a mass grave at the old Jewish Cemetery on Grosse Hamburger Strasse in the Soviet Sector. Since this location was in [[East Berlin]] in 1961, this gravesite could not be investigated, nor has there been any attempt to excavate this gravesite since the [[reunification of Germany]].{{sfnp|Smale|2013}}\n\nIn 1961, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Michael Goleniewski]], the Deputy Chief of Polish Military Counter Intelligence, defected to the West. Goleniewski had worked as an interrogator of captured German officials from 1948 to 1952. He never met M\u00fcller, but said he had heard from his Soviet supervisors that sometime between 1950 and 1952, the Soviets had \"picked up M\u00fcller and taken him to Moscow\". The CIA tried to track down the men Goleniewski named as having worked with M\u00fcller in Moscow, but were unable to confirm his story.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} Israel also continued to pursue M\u00fcller: in 1967, two Israeli operatives were caught by West German police attempting to break into the Munich apartment of M\u00fcller's wife.{{Efn|Frischauer, Willi (16 November 1967), \"This Man Mueller,\" ''Evening Standard'', Issue: 44603.}}\n\nIn 1967, in [[Panama City]], a man named Francis Willard Keith was accused of being M\u00fcller. West German diplomats pressed [[Panama]] to extradite him for trial. West German prosecutors said Sophie M\u00fcller, 64, had seen photos of Keith and identified him as her long-missing husband. However, Keith was released once fingerprints proved he was not M\u00fcller.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}}\n\nThe CIA investigation concluded: \"There is little room for doubt that the Soviet and Czechoslovak [intelligence] services circulated rumors to the effect that M\u00fcller had escaped to the West&nbsp;... to offset the charges that the Soviets had sheltered the criminal&nbsp;... There are strong indications but no proof that M\u00fcller collaborated with [the Soviets]. There are also strong indications but no proof that M\u00fcller died [in Berlin].\" The CIA apparently remained convinced at that time that if M\u00fcller had survived the war, he was being harboured within the Soviet Union. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and the Soviet archives were opened, no evidence to support this belief emerged.{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} The U.S. National Archives commentary concludes: \"More information about M\u00fcller's fate might still emerge from still secret files of the former Soviet Union. The CIA file, by itself, does not permit definitive conclusions. Taking into account the currently available records, the authors of this report conclude that M\u00fcller most likely died in Berlin in early May 1945.\"{{sfn|Naftali et al., ''Heinrich M\u00fcller''}} By the 1990s, it was in any case increasingly unlikely that M\u00fcller, who was born in 1900, was alive even if he had survived the war.\n\nIn 2008, historian [[Peter Longerich]] published a biography of Heinrich Himmler, which appeared in English translation in 2012. Longerich asserts that M\u00fcller was with Himmler at [[Flensburg]] on 11 May, and accompanied Himmler and other SS officers in their unsuccessful attempt to escape capture by the Allies and reach Bavaria on foot. Longerich states that Himmler and M\u00fcller parted company at Meinstadt, after which M\u00fcller was not seen again.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=735}} Longerich provides no source for this claim, which contradicts previous accounts of M\u00fcller's disappearance. The source for Longerich's account appears to be the interrogation of one of Himmler's adjutants, [[Werner Grothmann]], the transcript of which contains references to \"M\u00fcller\".{{Efn|A facsimile of part of the relevant transcript appears at this German website: http://file1.npage.de/003951/70/html/ripper4.html}}\n\nIn 2013 Johannes Tuchel, the head of the [[Memorial to the German Resistance]], claimed M\u00fcller's body was found in August 1945 by a work crew cleaning up corpses and was one of 3,000 buried in a mass grave on the site of a former Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte. While Tuchel was confident that he had solved the mystery, whether M\u00fcller is actually there has not been confirmed.{{sfnp|Brown|2013}} Nonetheless, the uncertainty of M\u00fcller's ultimate end and/or whereabouts has only served to nourish the \"mysterious power\" that the Gestapo elicits even to the present.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nWalter Schellenberg alleged in his memoir that Muller had defected to the Soviets in 1945. Schellenberg wrote that in 1950 a German officer who had been a prisoner of war in Russia stated that he had seen Muller in Moscow in 1948 and that he had died shortly afterward. There is no reference in the memoir as to who the German officer was or any other details that might help verify this claim.{{sfn|Schellenberg|1956|p=321}}\n\n=== Falsified M\u00fcller CIC dossier ===\nIn July 1988 author [[Ian Sayer]] received, from an anonymous individual, a 427-page (photocopied) [[US Army Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) file that claimed it had been inadvertently released by the US National Archives. The dossier purported to confirm that Heinrich M\u00fcller had survived the war and been retained by the CIC as an intelligence adviser.{{Sfn|Sayer|Botting|1989|pp=333\u2013335}}\n\nSayer and co-author [[Douglas Botting]] were known to be working on a comprehensive history of the [[US Army Counter Intelligence Corps|US Army's Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) at that time. The alleged dossier had also come to the attention of the US Department of Justice's Nazi hunting unit, the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]], who subsequently sought Sayer's opinion on the veracity of the documents. By this time the anonymous individual (later identified as Gregory Douglas) had managed to interest [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] and the ''[[The Times|London Times]]'' newspaper in his story.{{sfn|Whiting|2001|p=133 et seq}} However, the dossier claims and associated materials were found to be

In 1762 he was sent to [[Palma de Mallorca]] to study [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]] in the University of Letters of [[Mallorca]], where he was promoted to Bachelor of Philosophy on 5 March 1765 and appointed Master and Doctor in Liberal Arts four days later, with the distinction ''nemine discrepante''. He continued his studies by enrolling in Civil and Canon Law in the Pontifical University of [[Avignon]], where he got the doctoral tassel on 15 July 1767.\n\nOnce he finished his studies, he decided to settle down in Mah\u00f3n, where he combined his job as a lawyer in several public positions (sub-delegate judge of the vice-admiral of Menorca between 1780 and the Spanish conquest in 1783) and his intellectual endeavours. In 1778 he founded, along with Captain Joan Roca i Vinent, the Societat Maonesa de Cultura (Mah\u00f3n Society for Culture), which had its quarters in his own house. The society mainly dealt with natural and human sciences, and its members also read translations of works by [[Voltaire]], Wieland and Young, amongst others.\n\n==Work==\n\nFour main periods in the evolution of the work of Ramis can be observed through his books:\n\n'''First period'''\n\nThis first period, which took place during the second [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] domination (1763-1781), was the most prolific of them all. He wrote dramatic neoclassical plays in which he skilfully used the Catalan language to compose the French Alexandrine rhyming couplet: ''Lucr\u00e8cia'' (1769), ''Arminda'' (1775) and ''Const\u00e0ncia'' (1779). Moreover, as a founding member of Societat Maonesa de Cultura, he carried out an intense intellectual task until its dissolution in 1785.\n\nAn analysis of the works found in his library sheds light on his literary preferences: Greco-roman classical works including those written by [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Terence]]; 17th and 18th centuries writers such as Nicolas [[Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Voltaire]]; English classical and contemporary authors such as [[Shakespeare]], Thomson and Young; as well as Italians such as [[Petrarch]], [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Pietro Metastasio]]; and some German writers such as Gessner.\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nIn this period, which took place between 1783 and 1793, [[historiography]] became the central focus, whereas literature turned secondary. Some of the most important works written in this period are: ''Resumen topogr\u00e1fico e hist\u00f3rico de Menorca'' (1784), commissioned by the Royal Academy of History; ''Ensayo Latino-Menorqu\u00edn de los tres reynos vegetal, animal y mineral'' (1788); and ''Pesos y Medidas de Menorca y su correspondencia con los de Castilla''. Notwithstanding, he also produced some literary books such as those edited in 1783: ''\u00c8gloga de Tirsis i Filis'', using a neoclassical style, and the tragicomedy ''Rosaura'', following Baroque standards.\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nIn 1791 he wrote several elegies for his wife, Joana Montany\u00e8s, who died in that year and marked the beginning of the third period in Ramis\u2019 work with whom he had had two daughters. The year 1793, after his mother's (Caterina Ramis) death, marked the beginning of the third period in his work, when he focused on working to maintain the social status of his family. This is the reason why he took public positions including that of advisor of the Royal Heritage in 1802, judge of printers and bookstores in [[Menorca]] in 1805 and advisor in the commission of the Royal Tax Office in 1812. Even though his intellectual activity became secondary in this period, he continued writing several pieces of work, including burlesque and love poems as well as the work ''Els temps i paratges de Menorca en qu\u00e8 \u00e9s m\u00e9s gust\u00f3s i saludable el Peix'' (1811).\n\n'''Fourth period'''\n\nThis last period, which started in 1814, was a productive one, since he edited numerous history-related books: ''Alquer\u00edas de Menorca'' (1815), ''Situaci\u00f3n de la Isla de Menorca'' (1816), ''Varones Ilustres de Menorca'' (1817), ''Antig\u00fcedades c\u00e9lticas de la isla de Menorca'' (1818, [[Celtic antiques on the island of Menorca]]) (which was the first archaeological treatise about the island and all the Spanish state),<ref>In 2018 the book was re-edited with the original content in three languages (Catalan, Spanish and English) and several chapters devoted to Ramis' life and historical context: Pons, B. (ed.). Antig\u00fcedades c\u00e9lticas de la isla de Menorca, by Joan Ramis i Ramis (1818). Menorca: Institut Menorqu\u00ed d'Estudis, Consell Insular de Menorca, 2018.</ref><ref>Casasnovas et al., 15, 2018</ref> ''Alons\u00edada'' (1818, epic poem about the conquest of [[Menorca]] by the Catalan troops), and ''Historia civil y pol\u00edtica de Menorca'' (1819).\n\n==Historical context==\n\nBy analysing of the literary background and the weak [[demography]] of the island, with only 16,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the century and with 31,000 towards the end, it is difficult to think about the flourishing of the Catalan [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[literature]] in [[Menorca]], drama in particular, but also about a wide range of topics Menorcan literature covered and its European perspective, which are not found in any other part of the country.\n\nThere is a coherent historical explanation for the flourishing of these and other characteristics that are found in 18th-century Menorcan culture and cannot be found in the rest of the Catalan culture of the period. The end of the war against Philip 5th of Spain resulted in a diversification in the political scenario of Europe. The annexation of the [[Roussillon]] to the French kingdom became permanent as opposite to the initial situation which started in 1659, and the Frenchisation exerted a deeper influence.\n\nMenorca, was incorporated to the British crown in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), after which it followed a peculiar trajectory. Under British rule and the short occupation as the result of the War of the seven years (1756 \u2013 1763) it kept its political institutions. Throughout this period Catalan remained the official language, and even governor Sir Richard Kane spoke the language of Menorcan people. Moreover, four of the seventeen members of Societat Maonesa de Cultura were British and the number of schools teaching in the native language increased. In 1750 the first Menorcan printing press was imported from [[London]], Menorcan economy became dynamic, and not only [[agriculture]], stockbreeding and crafts flourished, but also the participation of the island in an international trade did so.

In 1762 he was sent to [[Palma de Mallorca]] to study [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]] in the University of Letters of [[Mallorca]], where he was promoted to Bachelor of Philosophy on 5 March 1765 and appointed Master and Doctor in Liberal Arts four days later, with the distinction ''nemine discrepante''. He continued his studies by enrolling in Civil and Canon Law in the Pontifical University of [[Avignon]], where he got the doctoral tassel on 15 July 1767.\n\nOnce he finished his studies, he decided to settle down in Ma\u00f3, where he combined his job as a lawyer in several public positions (sub-delegate judge of the vice-admiral of Menorca between 1780 and the Spanish conquest in 1783) and his intellectual endeavours. In 1778 he founded, along with Captain Joan Roca i Vinent, the Societat Maonesa de Cultura (Mah\u00f3n Society for Culture), which had its quarters in his own house. The society mainly dealt with natural and human sciences, and its members also read translations of works by [[Voltaire]], Wieland and Young, amongst others.\n\n==Work==\n\nFour main periods in the evolution of the work of Ramis can be observed through his books:\n\n'''First period'''\n\nThis first period, which took place during the second [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] domination (1763-1781), was the most prolific of them all. He wrote dramatic neoclassical plays in which he skilfully used the Catalan language to compose the French Alexandrine rhyming couplet: ''Lucr\u00e8cia'' (1769), ''Arminda'' (1775) and ''Const\u00e0ncia'' (1779). Moreover, as a founding member of Societat Maonesa de Cultura, he carried out an intense intellectual task until its dissolution in 1785.\n\nAn analysis of the works found in his library sheds light on his literary preferences: Greco-roman classical works including those written by [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Terence]]; 17th and 18th centuries writers such as Nicolas [[Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Voltaire]]; English classical and contemporary authors such as [[Shakespeare]], Thomson and Young; as well as Italians such as [[Petrarch]], [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Pietro Metastasio]]; and some German writers such as Gessner.\n\n'''Second period'''\n\nIn this period, which took place between 1783 and 1793, [[historiography]] became the central focus, whereas literature turned secondary. Some of the most important works written in this period are: ''Resumen topogr\u00e1fico e hist\u00f3rico de Menorca'' (1784), commissioned by the Royal Academy of History; ''Ensayo Latino-Menorqu\u00edn de los tres reynos vegetal, animal y mineral'' (1788); and ''Pesos y Medidas de Menorca y su correspondencia con los de Castilla''. Notwithstanding, he also produced some literary books such as those edited in 1783: ''\u00c8gloga de Tirsis i Filis'', using a neoclassical style, and the tragicomedy ''Rosaura'', following Baroque standards.\n\n'''Third period'''\n\nIn 1791 he wrote several elegies for his wife, Joana Montany\u00e8s, who died in that year and marked the beginning of the third period in Ramis\u2019 work with whom he had had two daughters. The year 1793, after his mother's (Caterina Ramis) death, marked the beginning of the third period in his work, when he focused on working to maintain the social status of his family. This is the reason why he took public positions including that of advisor of the Royal Heritage in 1802, judge of printers and bookstores in [[Menorca]] in 1805 and advisor in the commission of the Royal Tax Office in 1812. Even though his intellectual activity became secondary in this period, he continued writing several pieces of work, including burlesque and love poems as well as the work ''Els temps i paratges de Menorca en qu\u00e8 \u00e9s m\u00e9s gust\u00f3s i saludable el Peix'' (1811).\n\n'''Fourth period'''\n\nThis last period, which started in 1814, was a productive one, since he edited numerous history-related books: ''Alquer\u00edas de Menorca'' (1815), ''Situaci\u00f3n de la Isla de Menorca'' (1816), ''Varones Ilustres de Menorca'' (1817), ''Antig\u00fcedades c\u00e9lticas de la isla de Menorca'' (1818, [[Celtic antiques on the island of Menorca]]) (which was the first archaeological treatise about the island and all the Spanish state),<ref>In 2018 the book was re-edited with the original content in three languages (Catalan, Spanish and English) and several chapters devoted to Ramis' life and historical context: Pons, B. (ed.). Antig\u00fcedades c\u00e9lticas de la isla de Menorca, by Joan Ramis i Ramis (1818). Menorca: Institut Menorqu\u00ed d'Estudis, Consell Insular de Menorca, 2018.</ref><ref>Casasnovas et al., 15, 2018</ref> ''Alons\u00edada'' (1818, epic poem about the conquest of [[Menorca]] by the Catalan troops), and ''Historia civil y pol\u00edtica de Menorca'' (1819).\n\n==Historical context==\n\nBy analysing of the literary background and the weak [[demography]] of the island, with only 16,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the century and with 31,000 towards the end, it is difficult to think about the flourishing of the Catalan [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[literature]] in [[Menorca]], drama in particular, but also about a wide range of topics Menorcan literature covered and its European perspective, which are not found in any other part of the country.\n\nThere is a coherent historical explanation for the flourishing of these and other characteristics that are found in 18th-century Menorcan culture and cannot be found in the rest of the Catalan culture of the period. The end of the war against Philip 5th of Spain resulted in a diversification in the political scenario of Europe. The annexation of the [[Roussillon]] to the French kingdom became permanent as opposite to the initial situation which started in 1659, and the Frenchisation exerted a deeper influence.\n\nMenorca, was incorporated to the British crown in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), after which it followed a peculiar trajectory. Under British rule and the short occupation as the result of the War of the seven years (1756 \u2013 1763) it kept its political institutions. Throughout this period Catalan remained the official language, and even governor Sir Richard Kane spoke the language of Menorcan people. Moreover, four of the seventeen members of Societat Maonesa de Cultura were British and the number of schools teaching in the native language increased. In 1750 the first Menorcan printing press was imported from [[London]], Menorcan economy became dynamic, and not only [[agriculture]], stockbreeding and crafts flourished, but also the participation of the island in an international trade did so. Due to this economic activity, specially based in the new capital, [[Mah\u00f3n]], there was a rise of the commercial bourgeoisie, which was open to relationships with the rest of Europe. In this context, the sons of well-to-do families studied in the continent, mostly in French universities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capture of Minorca (1798)]]\n* [[Enlightenment in Spain]]\n* [[List of Governors of Menorca]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n\u00abJoan Ramis\u00bb.
