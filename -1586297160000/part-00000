The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Moon|Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal. In the outer worlds, the residents' efforts to enhance life, particularly terraforming on Mars, begin to wane, since much richer worlds are now available, and investment \"here at home\" is not as attractive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Thomas Jane]], [[Steven Strait]], [[Cas Anvar]]\n| image1      = Thomas Jane by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1      = 2104\n| height1     = 2992\n| image2      = Steven Strait at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg\n| width2      = 2504\n| height2     = 3340\n| image3      = Cas Anvar by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width3      = 1421\n| height3     = 1965\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Dominique Tipper]], [[Wes Chatham]], [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]\n| image1      = Dominique Tipper (2012) (cropped).jpg\n| width1      = 1006\n| height1     = 1420\n| image2      = Wes Chatham.jpg\n| width2      = 1497\n| height2     = 1786\n| image3      = ShohrehAghdashloo08TIFF (cropped).jpg\n| width3      = 468\n| height3     = 550\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Frankie Adams]], [[Florence Faivre]], [[Chad Coleman|Chad L.

The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Moon|Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Since music was always his first love, he went on to [[Columbia University]] to study music composition and conducting, where his passion became his profession. He quickly became busy as an arranger in New York; he moved to California in 1968 to pursue work in the movie and television field while continuing to write and arrange jazz albums.\n\nWilliams was also a leader in the music-education field for many years. He served as the Artistic Director of the Henry Mancini Institute \u2014 one of the nation's premier training programs for young musicians seeking professional careers in music \u2014 for five years. He was Visiting Professor and Composer-in-Residence at the [[University of Utah]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], which awarded him an honorary doctorate. He also held an honorary doctorate from Duke University and performed and/or lectured at such other institutions as the [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Indiana University]], [[Texas Christian University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Yale University]].\n\n==Career==\nWilliams scored more than 200 films, including ''[[Breaking Away]]'', for which he received a 1978 Oscar nomination; ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'', ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'', ''[[Cuba (film)|Cuba]]'', and ''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]''.\n\nOn television, his music accompanied ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', and ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]''. His jazz-funk arrangement of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Get Back]]\" was used as the longtime theme for the 1970s sports quiz show ''[[Sports Challenge]]'', emceed by [[Dick Enberg]].\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] asked Williams to arrange and conduct his two ''Duets'' albums. For clarinetist [[Eddie Daniels]], Williams wrote ''A Concerto in Swing''; for saxophonist [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], he penned ''Romances for Jazz Soloist and Orchestra''. His ''Theme For Earth Day'' was recorded by [[John Williams]] and the [[Boston Pops]].\n\n''An American Concerto'', composed in 1976, was one of the first successful attempts to combine jazz elements with traditional symphonic writing. In addition to ''An American Concerto'' his compositions include ''Gulliver'', ''Romances'', ''Earth Day'', ''Adagio'', and ''August'', as well as ''Suite Memories'' for trombone and symphony orchestra, which won a 1986 Grammy; ''Spring Wings'', a double concerto for piano and saxophone and symphony orchestra; ''Appalachian Morning'', recorded by the Boston Pops; ''Memento Mei'' for solo soprano and orchestra; ''The Prayer of St. Francis'' for flute and strings; and others.\n\nAnother of Williams' accomplishments was the 1986 orchestral work ''Gulliver''. He spent eight months writing the work, which was recorded by London's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], with narration by [[Larry Gelbart]] (based on [[Jonathon Swift]]'s writings) read by [[John Gielgud]]. For the concert premier, Williams conducted the Yale Philharmonia with [[Tony Randall]] narrating.\n\nIn 2016, [[Deana Martin]], daughter of [[Dean Martin]], recorded a new swing album, which Williams scored and conducted. He also wrote five songs for the album: \"52nd & Broadway,\" co-written with Gail Kantor, \"I've Been Around,\" \"Hearing Ella Sing,\u201d and \u201cGood Things Grow,\u201d co-written with [[Arthur Hamilton]] and \u201cI Know What You Are\u201d co-written with [[Will Jennings]]. The album ''Swing Street'' was released in 2016.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nNominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for composing the orchestral work ''An American Concerto'', he won two [[Grammy]]s for his jazz arrangements, four [[Emmy]]s for his television music, an Oscar nomination for film composition, and the Richard Kirk Award from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]. In addition to Williams' 4 Emmy wins, he received 23 nominations.\n\nFor his 2015 album ''[[Home Suite Home]]'', Williams earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album|Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2016-nominees-winners-list-story.html |title=2016 Grammy Awards: Complete list of winners and nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Williams' recordings are considered contemporary big-band standards, including ''Threshold'', which won a 1974 Grammy; ''Too Hip for the Room'', a Grammy nominee in 1983; ''Tenth Avenue'', a double Grammy nominee in 1987; and ''Sinatraland'', a tribute to the singer which was Grammy-nominated in 1998. Williams received 16 Grammy nominations for his compositions and arrangements.\n\n==Death==\nWilliams died of cancer in Santa Monica, California on July 25, 2018 at the age of 79.<ref>[https://variety.com/2018/tv/obituaries-people-news/patrick-williams-dead-dies-mary-tyler-moore-show-1202886296/ Patrick Williams, Emmy-Winning TV Composer, Dies at 79]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRespected music critic [[Gene Lees]] was quoted as saying: \"His ''An American Concerto'' is, in my opinion, the best mixture of jazz and classical that anybody has ever done. Pat's writing is breathtaking. He's just one of the finest arrangers and composers who ever put pen to paper.\"\n\nDaniel Cariaga wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \" ''An American Concerto'' must be one of the most attractive, affecting and original of jazz-symphonic meldings. The style is unrestrained, the tunes ingratiating, the writing expert. What Williams owes to the fair influences of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff seems no more and no less than other living composers may owe in those directions. What sets him a cut above others is the individual integration he has achieved out of those influences.\"\n\n==Film credits==\n*''[[Passion's Way]]'' (1999): Sela Ward, Timothy Dalton, Alicia Witt; Robert Allan Ackerman, Dir.\n*''[[Kiss the Sky (film)|Kiss the Sky]]'' (1998), MGM: William Petersen, Gary Cole, Sheryl Lee; Roger Young, Dir.\n*''[[Julian Po]]'' (1997), New Line Cinema: Christian Slater, Robin Tunney; Alan Wade, Dir.\n*''[[That Old Feeling (film)|That Old Feeling]]'' (1997), Universal: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina; Carl Reiner, Dir.\n*''Stormchasers'' (1995): Greg MacGillivray, Dir.\n*''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1995), New Line Cinema: Walter Matthau, Piper Laurie, Sissy Spacek; Charles Matthau, Dir.\n*''[[Big Girls Don't Cry...

Pat's writing is breathtaking. He's just one of the finest arrangers and composers who ever put pen to paper.\"\n\nDaniel Cariaga wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \" ''An American Concerto'' must be one of the most attractive, affecting and original of jazz-symphonic meldings. The style is unrestrained, the tunes ingratiating, the writing expert. What Williams owes to the fair influences of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff seems no more and no less than other living composers may owe in those directions. What sets him a cut above others is the individual integration he has achieved out of those influences.\"\n\n==Film credits==\n*''[[Passion's Way]]'' (1999): Sela Ward, Timothy Dalton, Alicia Witt; Robert Allan Ackerman, Dir.\n*''[[Kiss the Sky (film)|Kiss the Sky]]'' (1998), MGM: William Petersen, Gary Cole, Sheryl Lee; Roger Young, Dir.\n*''[[Julian Po]]'' (1997), New Line Cinema: Christian Slater, Robin Tunney; Alan Wade, Dir.\n*''[[That Old Feeling (film)|That Old Feeling]]'' (1997), Universal: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina; Carl Reiner, Dir.\n*''Stormchasers'' (1995): Greg MacGillivray, Dir.\n*''[[The Grass Harp (1995 film)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1995), New Line Cinema: Walter Matthau, Piper Laurie, Sissy Spacek; Charles Matthau, Dir.\n*''[[Big Girls Don't Cry...

A Max Lucado title has appeared on the CBA hardcover bestseller list every month for the last seven years.\"</ref> and pastor at Oak Hills Church (formerly the Oak Hills Church of Christ) in [[San Antonio, Texas]].\n\n==Life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n\nLucado was born in [[San Angelo, Texas]], the youngest of four children to Jack and Thelma Lucado. He grew up in [[Andrews, Texas]]. His father was an oil field worker, while his mother served as a nurse.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nLucado attended [[Abilene Christian University]] where he received an undergraduate degree in [[Mass Communication]]. While a student at Abilene Christian, Lucado worked to pay his way through college by selling books door-to-door with the [[Southwestern Advantage]] entrepreneurial program<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web |title=Several Famous People Held This Trying Summer Job |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/15/138168596/several-famous-people-held-this-trying-summer-job |website=npr.org |publisher=npr.org |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>. Initially he wished to become a lawyer, but has said that a required Bible course at the university and a mission trip made him change his mind, deciding instead to become a missionary. However, this required that Lucado get a graduate degree in Bible and Biblical Studies; and, have at least two years experience ministering to a church. Lucado graduated from Abilene Christian University with a master's degree in Bible and Biblical Studies.\n\nAfter graduation, Lucado became an associate minister at Central Church of Christ in [[Miami, Florida]]. His responsibilities initially included overseeing a singles' group and writing a column for the church's newsletter. After two years in Miami, the now newlywed Lucado and his wife, Denalyn Lucado, moved to [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]] to become full-time missionaries. In 1987, Lucado's father died from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]. After five years in Brazil, he brought his family back to the United States to be closer to his mother.\n\nMax and his wife appeared on ''[[Fixer Upper (TV series)|Fixer Upper]]'' (S3 E9 which aired January 26, 2016) when his daughter Sara and her husband Jeff Jones purchased a home that was to be remodeled by Chip & Joanna Gaines.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Basham |first=Megan |date=February 2, 2016 |title=Fixer Upper launches Christian revolution at HGTV |url=https://world.wng.org/2016/02/fixer_upper_launches_christian_revolution_at_hgtv |magazine=WORLD Magazine |access-date=March 30, 2020 }}</ref> Max asked that a quote that he had written for his daughter\u2019s wedding when he officiated be incorporated in some way into the new home without the couple knowing ahead of time.

Would you let your wine replace our water and look with grace on this son, this daughter? Oh Lord of Eden in your majesty create again your tapestry. One heart where there were two.

He is the main opponent of the vicar, yet as the series progresses, he comes to respect her. A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but defects to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him, though by the 2004 episode \"Happy New Year\" he is a Conservative Party supporter again. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him \"Dirty Dave\" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Alice Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Alice Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Emma Chambers]]\n| years= 1994\u20132011\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = {{unbulleted list|\"Wife Swap\"|<small>(Comic Relief 2007)</small>}}\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother = Mrs Tinker\n| sisters = Mary Tinker\n| husband = Hugo Horton (1998\u2014)\n| sons = At least 4 sons\n| daughters = Geraldine Horton <br> 5 others\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Verger, nursery assistant\n}}\n'''Alice Springs Horton''' (n\u00e9e '''Tinker''') is the [[verger]] at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having \"the intellectual capacity and charisma of a [[cactus]]\"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode \"Autumn.\" She is the product of a one-night stand between her [[insanity|mad]] mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays [[Cupid]] successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Father Christmas]] and the [[tooth fairy]]. After reading ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' she believes herself to be descended from [[Jesus]]. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking [[Black Sabbath]] for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of [[The Carpenters]] and referring to [[Albert Einstein]] as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the [[Wombles]] and of the [[Teletubbies]]. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice gets married to Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.\nAs a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, \"Just like Jesus, but with feathers\". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.\n\nA rabid fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown \"with lots of hearts on it...and a different [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]] in each one.\" However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a ''Doctor Who'' wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the [[Tenth Doctor]] and the other bridesmaids as [[Dalek]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hugo Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Hugo Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[James Fleet]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| father= David Horton\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 Illegitimate\n| wife= Alice Tinker (1998\u2014)\n| sons= 4 sons\n| daughters= {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts=\n| uncles=Simon Horton\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| occupation = Council member, David Horton's campaign manager\n}}\n'''Hugo Horton''' is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus. In \"Celebrity Vicar\", a newspaper describes him in the headline \"Rich as [[Croesus]], Thick as Shit\"; Hugo does not think the press meant to be rude, to which David replies \"Though you can't deny it's a possibility.\" Sometimes seen sporting a [[Royal Agricultural College]] tie, he served as his father's campaign manager at the October 1994 district council election, but inadvertently wound up going door to door with David's Labour opponent, Kevin Smewyn, delivering adverts and making introductions for him. Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in \"Engagement\". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be [[Father Christmas]]). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine \"Mrs God\". Hugo has a Golden Retriever named Bruno who is seen in \"Animals\" and \"Election\".  He is a huge fan of [[Kylie Minogue]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Frank Pickle ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Frank Pickle\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[John Bluthal]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2013''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| sisters = 2 (unknown names)\n| husband =\n| children= 1 (unknown name)\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| relatives = Wilfred (second cousin)\n| romances = Justin (1948)\n| occupation = Secretary\n}}\n'''Frank Pickle''' (born 1934) is the likable but boring and [[pedantic]] secretary of the parish council. He is so boring that nobody listens to him, even when he tries to relate such momentous events such as \"the time he went down to the pub and they'd completely run out of crisps\" or \"the time when the milkman was 47 minutes late\" or \"when he heard a cuckoo in March, only it turned out to be a pigeon\". In \"Celebrity Vicar\", while trying to get \"crazy anecdotes\" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks \"Is this The Most Boring Man in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]?\" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his [[homosexuality]] in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is [[bisexual]], as he also once admitted to fancying [[Margaret Beckett]] as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. \n\n\"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has \"not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever\".\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n== Jim Trott ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Jim Trott\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Trevor Peacock]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| spouse = {{unbulleted list|Duane <small>(?? - ??)</small>|Doris Trott <small>(1955\u2013mid 1990s; widowed/divorced)</small>}}\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| second cousins =\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n'''Jim Trott''' is a parish council member, who has an [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] way of prefacing \"no-no-no-no-no...\" to almost everything he says, in particular \"yes!\" A newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" gives him the headline \"No, No, No, No Brain\". His stuttering once led him to lose on ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. His wife Doris does the opposite, saying \"yes-yes-yes-yes-yes...\". Jim used to be a good dancer, though an unconvincing singer. Despite being married to Doris, he has no qualms about joining Owen in openly flirting with the Vicar, frequently commenting on her \"lovely arse\". He is also openly promiscuous with a penchant for young blondes and Eastern beauties. In one episode he learns that Doris is having sex with her cousin Brenda. In the final episode, he proposed to the vicar, suggesting that he is no longer married, perhaps through divorce, or that his wife has died prior to this episode or that he is willing to commit [[bigamy]]. He became the church organist after the death of Letitia Cropley. In the episode \"[[The Christmas Lunch Incident]]\", Jim mentions that Doris is taking \"A Competent Grandparenting Course\", suggesting Jim has children but this is never mentioned in the show, though it is implied he fathered a child with Owen's cousin Sally.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Owen Newitt ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Owen Newitt\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2013''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| wife =\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| cousins =Sally\n| romances ={{unbulleted list|Daisy|[[Geraldine Granger]] (1997)}}\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n\n'''Owen Newitt''' is a local farmer and a parish council member with a very earthy manner. He lives alone at the farm with his animals and is famous for displaying extremely poor personal hygiene, compounded with chronic problems with his stomach and bowels, both resulting in flatulence. The newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" dubbed him \"Britain's [[Body odor|B.O.]] King\". He was the first to support the new vicar's appointment as a lone dissenter, saying that a woman would not be a bad thing since the previous vicar was \"a regular old woman anyway\", just as David looked set to persuade the other members of the parish council to oppose Geraldine's appointment. His signature running gag was that he was chronically late for the parish council meetings, and had humorously legitimate, if gruesome, reasons for his delays (often involving graphic tales of amputating animals' appendages or otherwise mangling them). Previous generations of his family also appear to be as bloodthirsty as Owen, as he proudly declares they have been \"staging cock-fights\" and \"gassing badgers\" in the village for several centuries, and he also has a few murderers in his family. He also has had a history of \"sorrow and tragedy, \" according to Jim and Frank: his brother drowned himself, because of his girlfriend's refusing to marry him; his father shot himself shortly after his wife left him; and his grandmother tried to leave, but his grandfather shot ''her'' and then himself. Owen proposed to the vicar in \"Engagement\". She rejected him, mainly because she simply did not love him (she also cited, not to his face, that \"his breath smells like [[nerve agent|nerve gas]]\" and the [[gel]] on his hair is really [[lard]]). He was not upset, having found out that she was a drinker and declares he cannot tolerate women who drink. Despite this, he frequently makes crude and misguided attempts at flirting with her, which typically backfire, and even proposed to her again the night before her wedding to Harry Kennedy. Regardless of his foul mouth and coarse nature, Owen is a genuinely kind-hearted and caring person, a fact noted by the Vicar, Hugo and Alice, both of whom appointed him [[Godparent|godfather]] to their firstborn daughter. Owen spent every [[Christmas]] alone since his uncle's death in 1971 until Geraldine joined him for Christmas dinner in 1996 (one of many such invitations she accepted that year). In several episodes, dialogue suggests that Owen engages in [[bestiality]] (such as when he declares rumours that the vicar is a lesbian to be the \"best news since they made having sex with animals legal again\"). Owen also has a swearing 'probling' and often  uses the word 'bloody,' describing the word as 'a useful adjective'.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Letitia Cropley ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Letitia Cropley\n| image=\n| caption=\n| portrayer=[[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]]\n| years=1994\u201396\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= \"The Easter Bunny\"\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| died=Spring 1996\n| father=\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 (unknown name)\n| husband=\n| sons=\n| daughters=\n| grandsons=\n| granddaughters=\n| aunts=\n| uncles=\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| second cousins=\n| occupation= Council member, organist\n}}\n'''Letitia Cropley''' was a Parish Council member and the Dibley church [[organist]].

She was the creator of such revolting \"delicacies\" as \"Bread and butter pudding surprise\" (a recipe for which she was breeding [[snail]]s), [[Marmite]] cake (which she served for Frank's birthday), orange cake with [[Branston Pickle]] icing (which she served at the cake stall at the Dibley autumn fayre), parsnip brownies, plain pancakes \"with just a hint of liver,\" and chocolate spread sandwiches made with cod roe. Letitia only appeared in the first series and the special \"The Easter Bunny\", in which she died. Her dying request to Geraldine was that she take over from her as the Easter Bunny, taking chocolate eggs around the village each Easter. However, when Geraldine saw every member of the parish council doing the same, as well as some other residents, it became clear that she had made the same request to all of them, owing to her forgetful nature. Earlier in the episode she said she had a \"memory like an elephant that's lost its memory\".\nAfter her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as \"rampant\" and a \"[[nymphomaniac]].\" It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed.

Later Simon dumps her telling her that he has a girlfriend in Liverpool. A struck Geraldine therefore goes into seclusion, binging on chocolate bars and pots of ice cream, and neglecting her church duties. She decides to resign from her ministry as the Vicar of Dibley, but changes her mind when her parishioners and friends show their loyalty and support by hanging up a huge banner that reads \"That tall git Simon may have bonked you and then dumped you like an old jock strap but we still love you. \"\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Harry Kennedy===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Harry Kennedy\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]\n| years= 2006-2007\n| first = \"The Handsome Stranger\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2007''\n| classification= Former; occasional\n| born =\n| died =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers = \n| sisters = Rosie Kennedy\n| wife = Geraldine Granger (2007-2013)\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nieces = \n| nephews = \n| relatives = \n| romances = Geraldine Granger (2006-2007)\n| occupation = Accountant\n}}\n'''Harry Jasper Kennedy''' moves to Dibley from London, buying Sleepy Cottage from David Horton for \u00a3500,000.

Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie ([[Keeley Hawes]]) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, ''The Vicar in White''.

Her grandfather, David Horton, pities baby Geraldine and her siblings for being born to their simple-minded parents yet it is evident that they adore their daughter. A statue was made of Geraldine, as an infant, on the village green. She appears in the episodes \"Winter\", \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" and again with all nine of her siblings in a Christmas special. In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the \"Merry Christmas\" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born \"Vicar\" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name \"Geraldine\" instead and this becomes the child's name.\n\nAlice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special.  They had 10 children (four sons and six daughters).  As seen in a documentary of the 2004/05 specials DVD release, a scene with Geraldine greeting the children revealing their outrageous names was cut before the show went in front of cameras.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:BBC-related lists|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:Lists of British sitcom television characters|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:The Vicar of Dibley|Characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{overly detailed|date=February 2013}}\n{{in-universe|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' characters}}\nA list of characters in the BBC sitcom ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'':\n\n== The Revd Geraldine Granger ==\n\n{{main|Geraldine Granger}}\n\n== David Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = David Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Gary Waldhorn]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief 2013''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers = Simon Horton\n| wife =\n| sons = Hugo Horton\n| daughters = {{unbulleted list|1 Illegitimate|Alice Horton <small>(in-law)</small>}}\n| grandsons = 4 grandsons\n| granddaughters = {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Councillor\n}}\nCouncillor '''David Francis Matthew Horton [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]''', [[Master's degree|MA]] ([[University of Cambridge|Cantab]]), [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]], born on September 3 (year unknown), chairman of the Parish Council, gentleman farmer, pillar of the community, District Councillor for Dibley and Whitworth. He is the main opponent of the vicar, yet as the series progresses, he comes to respect her. A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but defects to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him, though by the 2004 episode \"Happy New Year\" he is a Conservative Party supporter again. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him \"Dirty Dave\" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Alice Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Alice Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Emma Chambers]]\n| years= 1994\u20132011\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = {{unbulleted list|\"Wife Swap\"|<small>(Comic Relief 2007)</small>}}\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother = Mrs Tinker\n| sisters = Mary Tinker\n| husband = Hugo Horton (1998\u2014)\n| sons = At least 4 sons\n| daughters = Geraldine Horton <br> 5 others\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Verger, nursery assistant\n}}\n'''Alice Springs Horton''' (n\u00e9e '''Tinker''') is the [[verger]] at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having \"the intellectual capacity and charisma of a [[cactus]]\"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode \"Autumn.\" She is the product of a one-night stand between her [[insanity|mad]] mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays [[Cupid]] successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Father Christmas]] and the [[tooth fairy]]. After reading ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' she believes herself to be descended from [[Jesus]]. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking [[Black Sabbath]] for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of [[The Carpenters]] and referring to [[Albert Einstein]] as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the [[Wombles]] and of the [[Teletubbies]]. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice gets married to Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.\nAs a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, \"Just like Jesus, but with feathers\". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.\n\nA rabid fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown \"with lots of hearts on it...and a different [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]] in each one.\" However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a ''Doctor Who'' wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the [[Tenth Doctor]] and the other bridesmaids as [[Dalek]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hugo Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Hugo Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[James Fleet]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| father= David Horton\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 Illegitimate\n| wife= Alice Tinker (1998\u2014)\n| sons= 4 sons\n| daughters= {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts=\n| uncles=Simon Horton\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| occupation = Council member, David Horton's campaign manager\n}}\n'''Hugo Horton''' is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus. In \"Celebrity Vicar\", a newspaper describes him in the headline \"Rich as [[Croesus]], Thick as Shit\"; Hugo does not think the press meant to be rude, to which David replies \"Though you can't deny it's a possibility.\" Sometimes seen sporting a [[Royal Agricultural College]] tie, he served as his father's campaign manager at the October 1994 district council election, but inadvertently wound up going door to door with David's Labour opponent, Kevin Smewyn, delivering adverts and making introductions for him. Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in \"Engagement\". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be [[Father Christmas]]). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine \"Mrs God\". Hugo has a Golden Retriever named Bruno who is seen in \"Animals\" and \"Election\".  He is a huge fan of [[Kylie Minogue]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Frank Pickle ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Frank Pickle\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[John Bluthal]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2013''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| sisters = 2 (unknown names)\n| husband =\n| children= 1 (unknown name)\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| relatives = Wilfred (second cousin)\n| romances = Justin (1948)\n| occupation = Secretary\n}}\n'''Frank Pickle''' (born 1934) is the likable but boring and [[pedantic]] secretary of the parish council. He is so boring that nobody listens to him, even when he tries to relate such momentous events such as \"the time he went down to the pub and they'd completely run out of crisps\" or \"the time when the milkman was 47 minutes late\" or \"when he heard a cuckoo in March, only it turned out to be a pigeon\". In \"Celebrity Vicar\", while trying to get \"crazy anecdotes\" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks \"Is this The Most Boring Man in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]?\" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his [[homosexuality]] in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is [[bisexual]], as he also once admitted to fancying [[Margaret Beckett]] as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. \n\n\"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has \"not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever\".\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n== Jim Trott ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Jim Trott\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Trevor Peacock]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| spouse = {{unbulleted list|Duane <small>(?? - ??)</small>|Doris Trott <small>(1955\u2013mid 90's; widowed/divorced)</small>}}\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| second cousins =\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n'''Jim Trott''' is a parish council member, who has an [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] way of prefacing \"no-no-no-no-no...\" to almost everything he says, in particular \"yes!\" A newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" gives him the headline \"No, No, No, No Brain\". His stuttering once led him to lose on ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. His wife Doris does the opposite, saying \"yes-yes-yes-yes-yes...\". Jim used to be a good dancer, though an unconvincing singer. Despite being married to Doris, he has no qualms about joining Owen in openly flirting with the Vicar, frequently commenting on her \"lovely arse\". He is also openly promiscuous with a penchant for young blondes and Eastern beauties. In one episode he learns that Doris is having sex with her cousin Brenda. In the final episode, he proposed to the vicar, suggesting that he is no longer married, perhaps through divorce, or that his wife has died prior to this episode or that he is willing to commit [[bigamy]]. He became the church organist after the death of Letitia Cropley. In the episode \"[[The Christmas Lunch Incident]]\", Jim mentions that Doris is taking \"A Competent Grandparenting Course\", suggesting Jim has children but this is never mentioned in the show, though it is implied he fathered a child with Owen's cousin Sally.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Owen Newitt ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Owen Newitt\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2013''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| wife =\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| cousins =Sally\n| romances ={{unbulleted list|Daisy|[[Geraldine Granger]] (1997)}}\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n\n'''Owen Newitt''' is a local farmer and a parish council member with a very earthy manner. He lives alone at the farm with his animals and is famous for displaying extremely poor personal hygiene, compounded with chronic problems with his stomach and bowels, both resulting in flatulence. The newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" dubbed him \"Britain's [[Body odor|B.O.]] King\". He was the first to support the new vicar's appointment as a lone dissenter, saying that a woman would not be a bad thing since the previous vicar was \"a regular old woman anyway\", just as David looked set to persuade the other members of the parish council to oppose Geraldine's appointment. His signature running gag was that he was chronically late for the parish council meetings, and had humorously legitimate, if gruesome, reasons for his delays (often involving graphic tales of amputating animals' appendages or otherwise mangling them). Previous generations of his family also appear to be as bloodthirsty as Owen, as he proudly declares they have been \"staging cock-fights\" and \"gassing badgers\" in the village for several centuries, and he also has a few murderers in his family. He also has had a history of \"sorrow and tragedy, \" according to Jim and Frank: his brother drowned himself, because of his girlfriend's refusing to marry him; his father shot himself shortly after his wife left him; and his grandmother tried to leave, but his grandfather shot ''her'' and then himself. Owen proposed to the vicar in \"Engagement\". She rejected him, mainly because she simply did not love him (she also cited, not to his face, that \"his breath smells like [[nerve agent|nerve gas]]\" and the [[gel]] on his hair is really [[lard]]). He was not upset, having found out that she was a drinker and declares he cannot tolerate women who drink. Despite this, he frequently makes crude and misguided attempts at flirting with her, which typically backfire, and even proposed to her again the night before her wedding to Harry Kennedy. Regardless of his foul mouth and coarse nature, Owen is a genuinely kind-hearted and caring person, a fact noted by the Vicar, Hugo and Alice, both of whom appointed him [[Godparent|godfather]] to their firstborn daughter. Owen spent every [[Christmas]] alone since his uncle's death in 1971 until Geraldine joined him for Christmas dinner in 1996 (one of many such invitations she accepted that year). In several episodes, dialogue suggests that Owen engages in [[bestiality]] (such as when he declares rumours that the vicar is a lesbian to be the \"best news since they made having sex with animals legal again\"). Owen also has a swearing 'probling' and often  uses the word 'bloody,' describing the word as 'a useful adjective'.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Letitia Cropley ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Letitia Cropley\n| image=\n| caption=\n| portrayer=[[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]]\n| years=1994\u201396\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= \"The Easter Bunny\"\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| died=Spring 1996\n| father=\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 (unknown name)\n| husband=\n| sons=\n| daughters=\n| grandsons=\n| granddaughters=\n| aunts=\n| uncles=\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| second cousins=\n| occupation= Council member, organist\n}}\n'''Letitia Cropley''' was a Parish Council member and the Dibley church [[organist]].

Letitia only appeared in the first series and the special \"The Easter Bunny\", in which she died. Her dying request to Geraldine was that she take over from her as the Easter Bunny, taking chocolate eggs around the village each Easter. However, when Geraldine saw every member of the parish council doing the same, as well as some other residents, it became clear that she had made the same request to all of them, owing to her forgetful nature. Earlier in the episode she said she had a \"memory like an elephant that's lost its memory\".\nAfter her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as \"rampant\" and a \"[[nymphomaniac]].\" It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed.

Later Simon dumps her telling her that he has a girlfriend in Liverpool. A struck Geraldine therefore goes into seclusion, binging on chocolate bars and pots of ice cream, and neglecting her church duties.

Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie ([[Keeley Hawes]]) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, ''The Vicar in White''.

In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the \"Merry Christmas\" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born \"Vicar\" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name \"Geraldine\" instead and this becomes the child's name.\n\nAlice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special.

The system was the eighth cyclone and the fifth severe tropical cyclone of the [[2002-03 South Pacific cyclone season]]. Cyclone Erica developed from a [[monsoon]]al [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] on 4 March just off of [[Queensland]]. Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the east and then north early in its existence. However, increasing [[wind shear]] caused the storm to be degenerated into a [[tropical low]]. After conditions once again became more favorable for development, the remnants regenerated into a tropical cyclone on 10 March. Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on 13 March as a Category 5 equivalent on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian intensity scale]].\n\nOn the same day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making landfall on the southern end of the island at [[L'\u00cele-des-Pins]]. However, at the same time the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. After passing the island, an [[extratropical transition]] begun, weakening the cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an [[extratropical cyclone]] and later fully dissipated two days later.\n\nCyclone Erica severely impacted the island nation of New Caledonia, causing intense winds and heavy rain. An estimated 892 families were affected by the cyclone on the island, and two people were killed. As many as 60% of people on the west coast [[power outage|lost power]]. On 17 March only 17 of the 66 [[secondary school]]s on the island were functioning. After the storm it was feared that the existing [[dengue fever]] [[epidemic]] on the island would spread. Erica caused $15 million (2003&nbsp;USD) in damages, primarily on New Caledonia. Following the deaths and damage, the name \"Erica\" was later retired.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Erica 2003 track.png}}\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Erica's precursor tropical low initially developed within a [[monsoon]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] near the [[Tiwi Islands]] on 13 February.<ref name=\"March 2003\">{{cite web|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary March 2003 |url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0303.htm |accessdate=26 August 2012 |author=Padget, Gary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vy2pM0uM?url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0303.htm |archivedate=24 January 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the low moved south-southwest into the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, before it made landfall near the [[Western Australia]]\u2013[[Northern Territory]] border during 15 February.<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> Over the next couple of weeks, the low moved across the Australian interior and passed to the south of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> It subsequently moved northwards towards Mount Isa in Queensland, before it started to move eastwards and entered the Coral Sea near the Whitsunday Islands during 3 March.<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> \n\nStrong [[wind shear]] separated the [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] from the system at the time.

The system was the eighth cyclone and the fifth severe tropical cyclone of the [[2002-03 South Pacific cyclone season]]. Cyclone Erica developed from a [[monsoon]]al [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] on 4 March just off of [[Queensland]]. Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the east and then north early in its existence. However, increasing [[wind shear]] caused the storm to be degenerated into a [[tropical low]]. After conditions once again became more favorable for development, the remnants regenerated into a tropical cyclone on 10 March. Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on 13 March as a Category 5 equivalent on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian intensity scale]].\n\nOn the same day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making landfall on the southern end of the island at [[L'\u00cele-des-Pins]]. However, at the same time the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. After passing the island, an [[extratropical transition]] begun, weakening the cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an [[extratropical cyclone]] and later fully dissipated two days later.\n\nCyclone Erica severely impacted the island nation of New Caledonia, causing intense winds and heavy rain. An estimated 892 families were affected by the cyclone on the island, and two people were killed. As many as 60% of people on the west coast [[power outage|lost power]]. On 17 March only 17 of the 66 [[secondary school]]s on the island were functioning. After the storm it was feared that the existing [[dengue fever]] [[epidemic]] on the island would spread. Erica caused $15 million (2003&nbsp;USD) in damages, primarily on New Caledonia. Following the deaths and damage, the name \"Erica\" was later retired.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Erica 2003 track.png}}\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Erica's precursor tropical low initially developed within a [[monsoon]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] near the [[Tiwi Islands]] on 13 February.<ref name=\"March 2003\">{{cite web|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary March 2003 |url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0303.htm |accessdate=26 August 2012 |author=Padget, Gary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vy2pM0uM?url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com/cyclones/2003/summ0303.htm |archivedate=24 January 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the low moved south-southwest into the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, before it made landfall near the [[Western Australia]]\u2013[[Northern Territory]] border during 15 February.<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> Over the next couple of weeks, the low moved across the Australian interior and passed to the south of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> It subsequently moved northwards towards Mount Isa in Queensland, before it started to move eastwards and entered the Coral Sea near the Whitsunday Islands during 3 March.<ref name=\"March 2003\"/> \n\nStrong [[wind shear]] separated the [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] from the system at the time.
