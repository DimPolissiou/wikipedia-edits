Previously published by [[John Brown Publishing]] (from 1991 to 2001) and then I Feel Good Publishing (2001 to 2005), it is now published by [[Dennis Publishing Ltd]]. \n\nIn December 2018 its print circulation was just over 14,800 copies per month.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/6756| title=Product Page - ABC 01 Jan 2018 - 31 Dec 2018 | work=[[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)]] | accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref> This now appears to include digital sales. The magazine's tagline is \"The World of Strange Phenomena\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nThe roots of the magazine that was to become ''Fortean Times'' can be traced back to Bob Rickard's discovering the works of [[Charles Fort]] through the secondhand method of reading science-fiction stories:\n:\"[[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]], the editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''  (as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' was then titled), for example,\" writes Rickard \"encouraged many authors to expand Fort's data and comments into imaginative stories.\"<ref name=\"Rickard\">{{cite book | editor-last1=Rickard| editor-first1=Bob| authorlink1 = Bob Rickard| editor-last2=Sieveking |editor-first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Sieveking |date=June 1992 | title=''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'': Fortean Times Issues 1\u201315 | edition=Fortean Tomes, 2nd edition, 1995| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870870-26-3 }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, while Rickard was studying [[Product Design]] at [[Birmingham School of Art|Birmingham Art College]] he met several like-minded [[science fiction]] fans, particularly crediting fellow-student [[Peter Weston]]'s fan-produced ''Speculation'' [[magazine]] as helping him to \"[learn] the art of putting together a [[fanzine]],\" some years before he created his own.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Attending a science fiction [[fan convention|convention]] in 1968, Rickard obtained Ace paperback copies of all four of Fort's books from a stall run by Derek Stokes (later to run [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]] and take a role in the day-to-day running of ''The Fortean Times'').<ref name=\"Rickard\" />\n\nAfter reading an advert in the underground magazine ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' (in 1969) for the \"[[International Fortean Organisation]]\" (INFO), an American group \"founded in 1966... by Paul and Ronald Willis,\" who had acquired material from the original [[Fortean Society]] (started in 1931, but in limbo since the 1959 death of its founder [[Tiffany Thayer]]), Rickard began to correspond with the brothers, particularly Paul. Rickard was instrumental in encouraging the Willises to publish their own Fortean journal \u2013 the \"INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown\" began intermittent publication in Spring, 1967 \u2013 and sent them many British newspaper clippings, although few saw print. \n\nRickard later discovered that the production was fraught behind-the-scenes as Ronald Willis had been seriously ill, Paul thus finding it difficult to \"keep up with things\" on his own.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Ultimately, the Willises were instrumental in inspiring Rickard to create his ''own'' periodical. Ron Willis succumbed to a brain tumour in March 1975.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /><ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=April 1975 | work=The News #9}}</ref> Bearing a date of  November 1973, the first issue of Rickard's self-produced and self-published ''The News'' was available directly from him.\n\n===''The News'' (1973\u20131976)===\nThe magazine which was to continue [[Charles Fort]]'s work documenting the unexplained was founded by [[Bob Rickard|Robert JM \"Bob\" Rickard]] in 1973 as his self-published bi-monthly mail order \"hobbyish newsletter\" miscellany ''The News'' \u2014 \"A Miscellany of Fortean Curiosities\".<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The title is said to be \"a contraction taken from [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''The News from Nowhere''\",<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> (although Rickard may be conflating/confusing Butler's ''[[Erewhon]]'' and [[William Morris]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> ''\"[[News from Nowhere]]\"''). ''The News'' saw fairly regular bi-monthly publication for 15 issues between November 1973 and April 1976. Debuting at 35p (\u00a31.80/$4.50 for a year of 6 issues<ref>Early advertisements promised a monthly, 12-issue subscription for the same price, but monetary and time constraints caused Rickard to move to a bi-monthly schedule, and use any 'extra' monies to merely produce a greater number of pages</ref>) for 20 pages, ''The News'' was produced on Rickard's typewriter, with headings created with [[Letraset]], during (as Rickard says in #2) the late-1970s [[Power outage|blackout]]s. The first issue featured a cover (which would become briefly the unofficial logo of ''The News'') drawn by Rickard from a [[Selfridges]] advert originally created by [[Bernard Partridge]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=November 1973| work=The News #1}}</ref> From the second issue, pictures and photographs from various newspapers were interpolated within the text. The price was raised slightly for #6 \u2014 which also saw the page count upped to 24pg \u2014 due in large part to rising postal and paper costs.\n\nHelping behind the scenes was [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]], a kindred-spirit whom Rickard met at a comics convention when the latter was a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC]]. The two found they had much in common \u2014 including a love of Chinese mysticism \u2014 and Moore helped inspire Rickard to publish ''The News''.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The early issues featured some articles by different individuals, but were \"largely the work of Bob Rickard, who typed them himself with some help from Steve Moore.\"<ref name=\"madplanet\">{{cite book | last1=Sieveking | first1=Paul| authorlink1 = Paul Sieveking | last2=Rickard |first2=Bob |authorlink2=Bob Rickard |last3=Moore |first3=Steve |authorlink3=Steve Moore (comics)|year=1991 | title=''Diary of a Mad Planet'': Fortean Times Issues 16\u201325 | edition=2nd ed. 1995| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870021-25-8 }}</ref>\n\n====Key ''News''-people====\nMoore and Paul Screeton (then editor of ''The Ley Hunter''), both urged on the first few uncertain issues\" and Moore would frequently join Rickard to \"stuff envelopes and hand-write a few hundred addresses\" to disseminate the early issues.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Rickard also highlights amongst the key early ''Fortean Times'' advocates and supporters: Ion Alexis Will, who discovered ''The News'' in 1974 and became a \"constant [source] of valuable clippings, books, postcards and entertaining letters\"; Janet and Colin Bord, later authors of ''Mysterious Britain'' (Janet also wrote for ''Flying Saucer Review'' and Lionel Beer's ''Spacelink'', while it was Colin's Fortean article in ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'' that is particularly cited by Rickard as bringing him/them to his attention); Phil Ledger, a \"[[nomad|peripatetic]] [[marine biologist]]\", and ''The News''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"first enthusiastic fan\"; [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]], Fortean theatre director and [[playwright]]; [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]; graphic designer Richard Adams and Dick Gwynn, who both helped with the evolving layout and typesetting of later issues; Chris Squire, who helped organise the first subscription database; Canadian \"Mr. X\"; Mike Dash and cartoonist [[Hunt Emerson]]. Emerson was introduced to Rickard in late 1974, when after seven issues, he \"wanted to improve the graphics\", which Emerson certainly did, providing around 30 headings for use in issues #8 onwards. (Emerson's still-on-going monthly \"Phenomenomix\" strip in ''FT'' had its prototype in #11's three-page \"Fortean Funnies\").<ref name=\"Rickard\" />\n\n====Notable ''News'' content====\nOther early contributors included writer and researcher Nigel Watson (Chairman of the Scunthorpe UFO Research Society 'SUFORS'), who wrote \"Mysterious Moon\" for ''The News'' #2. Watson would later write a regular column of UFO commentary entitled ''Enigma Variations'' (from #29), and articles on the subject of [[UFO]]-related murders and stories of sexual assault by aliens. Phil Grant wrote about [[Ley lines]] for #3 and Mary Caine who revised an earlier article (from ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'') on [[Temple of the Stars|The Glastonbury]] [[Landscape zodiac|Zodiac]] for issue #4, which also saw the debut of the \"Reviews\" section, beginning with comments on a book by [[John Michell]], the Sphere reprint of [[Charles Fort]]'s ''New Lands'' and [[John Sladek]]'s ''The New Apocrypha''.\nIssues #2 and #3 noted that ''The News'' was published \"with an arrangement with INFO\", this was revised from #4 to it being \"''affiliated to'' the [[International Fortean Organisation]]\". From #5, Mark A. Hall produced a section entitled \"Fortean USA\", continuing on from his earlier, discontinued, newsletter ''From My Files''; issue #5 also saw William Porter's article on Llandrillo printed, after being delayed from #4 for space constraints. [[Janet Bord]] contributed \"Some Fortean Ramblings\" alongside [[William R. Corliss]]'s \"The Evolution of the Fortean Sourcebooks\" for #7, and issue #8 was the first issue of Vol. 2, after Rickard decided to end Volume 1 with #7 (not #6 as fully bi-monthly titles do), since that issue was dated November '74, thereby attempting to keep each Volume aligned with a year.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=July 1974| work=The News #5}}</ref>\n\nIssue #8 (or, Volume 2, issue #1) saw the special \"Christmas present\" of headings by [[Hunt Emerson]], after Rickard was introduced to Emerson by Carol and Nick Moore as Hunt was working on ''Large Cow Comix''. Described by Rickard as \"as much a disciple of [[George Herriman|George [Herriman]]]... and my [Rickard's] favourite artists from ''[[Mad Magazine|Mad]]'' ([[Will Elder|Bill Elder]] and [[Wally Wood]])\" as Rickard was of Charles Fort, the two got on well, with Emerson producing not only a series of headings, but later strips and covers for issues right up to the present day.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The death of INFO co-founder Ronald J Willis was announced in #9, which described itself as providing \"bi-monthly notes on Fortean phenomena\", and an index to the first year's issues (#1\u20137) became available. Colin Bord penned \"Amazing Menagerie\" for issue #10, while [[Paul Devereux]] and Andrew York x=compiled an exhaustive study of [[Leicestershire]] in \"Portrait of a Fault Area\", serialised in #11\u201312. Issue #11 featured Rickard and Emerson's first \"Fortean Funnies\" cartoon, while #12 saw a price rise to 50p/$1.25, a logo change (from Selfridges' herald-on-horseback to the more descriptive Fort's face-encircled) and a tweaking of its tagline to \"bi-monthly ''news &'' notes on Fortean phenomena.\" Issue #14 first mentioned Rickard and Michell's then-in-production book ''Phenomena!'', which would be more actively trailed from #18. Issue #15 \u2014 now with 28 pages \u2014 announced that Rickard had decided to bow to popular opinion and retitle his miscellany with a more descriptive title. Thus, with a subtitle of \"Portents & Prodigies\", ''Fortean Times'' was born.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=April 1976| work=The News #15}}</ref>\n\n===''Fortean Times'' (since 1976)===\nAfter fifteen issues of ''The News'', issue #16 (1976) saw the magazine renamed ''Fortean Times'', which \"new title emerged from correspondence between Bob Rickard and Paul Willis\" \u2014 the two having talked of creating a Fortean version of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, \"full of weird and wonderful news and read by millions worldwide\".<ref name=\"madplanet\" /> Its cover bore the descriptive text \"Strange phenomena \u2014 curiosities \u2014 prodigies \u2014 portents \u2014 mysteries,\" while the inside cover kept the 'Fort face' logo from later issues of ''The News'' but bore the revised legend \"A Contemporary Record of Strange Phenomena\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=June 1976| work=The Fortean Times #16}}</ref> Included within was an offer for a \"4-colour [[silk-screen]]ed poster\" created by Hunt Emerson for this landmark issue. From the start, this new format compounded earlier financial difficulties for Rickard, following on from #14's plea: \"we need more subscribers or we die!\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=January 1976| work=The News #14}}</ref> (''Fortean Times'' issues #16\u201318 \u2014 as ''The News'' #1\u201315 before them \u2014 were solely edited, published and in large part written & typed by Rickard himself. Even by passing on rising postal and paper costs to the readership \u2014 which Rickard constantly reiterates that he is loath to do, the early ''Fortean Times'' was constantly facing an uphill financial battle.) Early editorials of the new ''FT'', therefore (in fact beginning with ''The News'' #15) featured a notification of donations received, naming and thanking the hardcore readership (which included many current and future-contributors) for monies received, which aided the move towards higher production values. With donations helping to offset costs, the price was held at 50p up until issue #20, whereupon the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule from Spring 1977 (Issue #21) \u2014 but raised the page count (and price) to continue producing the same amount of material for the same yearly fee (40pg, 75p ea. or \u00a33/year).\n\nIssue #18 saw a new semi-regular feature entitled \"Forteana Corrigenda,\" aimed at correcting \"errors in the literature\" that had crept into various Fortean works through misquotation or other difficulties. After 18 more-or-less solo-produced issues, long-term supporter and helper Steve Moore was credited as assistant editor for issues #19\u201321, becoming co-contributing editor (with Phil Ledger, Stan Nichols and Paul J Willis) on issues #22\u201326 and 'associate editor' from issue #27. He was joined by contributing editor David Fideler, and subsequently (also as co-associate editor) by [[Paul Sieveking]] (#28\u2014 ) and Valerie Thomas (#31\u201332). Issue #20 announced that [[Kay Thompson]] (a staff member of ''Ley Hunter'' magazine, then under the editorship of [[Paul Devereux]], with whom ''FT'' shared an address for several issues) would be helping to type parts of subsequent issues to further delegate the burden from Rickard. He, Moore and Sieveking were also later joined editorially by author [[Mike Dash]] (who is mentioned as particularly overseeing the publication of scholarly occasional papers), before Moore moved from full editorial to largely correspondent duties for a dozen issues after #42, returning as a contributing editor in Autumn 1990 (#55). The four \u2014 Rickard, Sieveking, Dash and Moore \u2014 are often collectively referred to as \"The Gang of Fort,\" after the [[The Gang of Four|Gang of ''Four'']].\n\nIssue #21 saw the debut of ''FT'' semi-regular column \"Strange Deaths\" (later descriptively subtitled \"Unusual ways of shuffling off this mortal coil\"), while issue #22 updated ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s to include <small>([[Ivan T. Sanderson]]'s)</small> The Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained (SITU), alongside INFO. Issue #23 featured an article by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] on, aptly, \"[[23 (numerology)|The 23 Phenomenon]],\"<ref>Wilson, Robert Anton. [http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html \"The 23 Phenomenon,\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928122012/http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html |date=September 28, 2008 }} ''Fortean Times'' (May 2007).</ref> made available a second Index (1975, to ''The News'' #8\u201313) and included a 12-page 'Review Supplement', issued as a separately bound supplement since the-then printers had difficulty binding more than 40 pages. With #24, the printers were changed to Windhorse Press to overcome this difficulty, and ''FT'' became officially 52 pages in length, the changes cemented in issue #25 with a new font for the title and a change of address \u2014 c/o London-based \"SF and cosmic\" bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed]], run by Derek Stokes (who had sold Rickard the four Fort books ten years previously). The same issue ran an obituary for [[Eric Frank Russell]], of whom Rickard was a considerable fan. He writes that Russell turned down an invitation to contribute material to ''The News'' back in 1973, having \"earned his rest\" after 40 years as an active Fortean. Rickard further states that Russell was one of the key Fortean-fiction writers he read in [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''  and ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', and the author of \"the first Fortean book I [Rickard] ever read\": Russell's ''Great World Mysteries''.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Obituaries cont.| date=Spring 1978| work=Fortean Times #25, p. 43}}</ref> Issue #26 trailed \"a special series of 'Occasional Papers' in Fortean subjects\" to be edited by Steve Moore, and #27 \u2014 the 5th Anniversary issue \u2014 welcomed Michigan-native David Fideler (whose ''Anomaly Research Bulletin'' was then due to cease publication, although its subscribers, ''FT'' promised, would be absorbed by them) as ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"man in the New World\".\n\n====Paul Sieveking and ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s format change====\nIn 1978, mutual friend Ion Will introduced Rickard to [[Paul Sieveking]], who recalls that \"the Forteans used to meet every Tuesday afternoon above the science-fiction bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]] in Soho, a shop run by Derek Stokes, to open post and interact. (Indeed, this was the semi-official address of ''FT'' until that shop closed. With #35, Summer '81 the address was changed.) Sieveking joined the ''FT'' team with #28 as co-associate editor, and writes, highlighting the intrinsic early difficulties in printing ''FT'' that that issue \"was printed by an Israeli entrepreneur in northern Greece and shipped to London.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1=Sieveking | first1=Paul| authorlink1 = Paul Sieveking | last2=Rickard |first2=Bob |authorlink2=Bob Rickard |last3=Moore |first3=Steve |authorlink3=Steve Moore (comics) |date=April 1990 | title=''Seeing Out the Seventies'': Fortean Times Issues 26\u201330 | edition=Fortean Tomes 1990| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870021-20-7 }}</ref> That issue (#28), bearing a cover blurb of \"Strange Phenomena\", featured an early advert for the bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]], drawn by [[Bryan Talbot]], while the editorial promised that the ''next'' issue would not only see the availability of Index 1976, but be in a \"larger and more professional format, typeset throughout, [with] better graphics, layout and legibility.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Winter 1979 | work=Fortean Times #28}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, #29, under a cover by Hunt Emerson,<ref>The cover would later be used for the ''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'' collection of ''The News'' issues #1\u201315.</ref> was printed fully typeset in A4 (thanks to art director Richard Adams of AdCo and, according to Rickard's preface to ''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'', Dick Gwynn) and even distributed on a limited basis through [[WH Smiths]]. The move away from production on Rickard's typewriter gave \"The ''Journal'' of Strange Phenomena,\" (as it was now subtitled) greater ability to produce longer, better laid-out articles. These opened with a seven-page guide to \"Charles Fort and Fortean Times\" by Bob Rickard, explaining the background and philosophy of ''FT'' as well as outlining the influence of Fort \"who\", writes Rickard, \"is still largely unknown\",<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Charles Fort and Fortean Times| date=Summer 1979 | work=Fortean Times #29}}</ref> and also included the first of Nigel Watson's \"Enigma Variations\" columns and [[Loren Coleman]]'s \"Devil Names and Fortean Places\" article sat alongside comments by Colin Bord, [[Tim Dinsdale]], [[Vernon Harrison|VGW Harrison]] and Rickard on [[Anthony 'Doc' Shiels]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> 1977 \"[[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]\" photographs. The magazine itself dropped the description 'non-profitmaking' from its publication information, and ceased to name its stated-affiliations to INFO and SITU and 'other Fortean journals' in favour the more general aim to be a \"friend to all groups and magazines continuing the work of Charles Fort\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Summer 1979 | work=Fortean Times #29}}</ref> It also contained a considerably higher number of adverts, including both inside covers \u2014 making the page count slightly higher than previous issues, which had previously counted the cover as page 1 \u2014 and an early advert by [[Brian Bolland]] for [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] (which would ironically begin to take off only after the closure of Stokes's [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]]).\n\nIssue #30 announced that while \"over the last couple of issues [the] subscriber list... nearly doubled,\" so too had the \"printing, production and postage bill,\" necessitating a price rise to 95p/$2.50 \u2014 albeit softened by another length increase, to 68 pages. Now published not merely by Rickard, but by 'Fortean Times Ltd', it was typeset by Warpsmith Graphics and printed by Bija Press. The cover was painted by Una Woodruff (whose ''Inventorum Natura'' was reviewed within) to illustrate [[John Michell]]'s article on \"Spontaneous Images and Acheropites,\" drawing on his 1979 [[Thames & Hudson]] book dealing with \u2014 and titled \u2014 \"''[[Simulacra]]''\". Bob Rickard produced an article on one \"[[Clemente Dominguez]]: Pope, [[heresy|Heretic]], [[Stigmata|Stigmatic]];\" [[Michael A. Hoffman II|Michael Hoffman]] speculated on the occult aspects of a serial killer in \"[[The Son of Sam|The Sun of Sam]];\" Robert J. Schadewald wrote about \"The Great [[Raining animals|Fish Fall]] of 1859\" while [[Hunt Emerson]] produced the first cartoon strip under the title \"Phenomenomix\".\n\nSieveking took over full editorial duties from Rickard with #43, helming the subsequent four quarterly issues (to #46) to give Rickard a chance to \"revitalize\",<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Autumn 1984 | work=The Fortean Times #42}}</ref> which he did, returning with #46 to the position of co-editor. Moore, Dash and Ian Simmons (and others) variously edited the magazine for the next 18+ years, and although main editorship passed from Rickard and Sieveking to [[David Sutton (writer)|David Sutton]] in 2002, they both continue to contribute \u2014 Sieveking continues as before, editing and writing most of the Strange Days news section and editing the letters pages, and acting as the main quality-control proof-reader, as well as producing the occasional feature (while Sieveking's wife edits the \"Reviews\" section).\n\nDuring the 40+ years of its publication, ''Fortean Times'' has changed both format and publishers on a few occasions. Early issues (particularly of ''The News'') were produced in black & white (for ease of photocopying), and the whole was largely produced by [[typewriter]] until #29. Colour, professional printing (and wider distribution) followed and a 6.5 x 4.5in size held sway for several years before the magazine settled into its \"normal\" A4 (magazine) size in the 1980s, after which glossy covers followed. Several changes of logo and font have occurred throughout its life.\n\n==General content==\nThe identification of correct original sources by contributors is a defining feature of the magazine, as it was for Charles Fort himself. However, the \"objective reality\" of these reports is not as important.  The magazine \"maintains a position of benevolent scepticism towards both the orthodox and the unorthodox\" and \"[[Toe the line|toes no party line]]\". \nThe range of subject matter is extremely broad including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n* General [[Forteana]]\n* Anomalous phenomena\n* [[Vision (spirituality)|Apparitions]]\n* Bizarre deaths\n* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Crop circle]]s\n* [[Cryptozoology]]\n* [[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]s and [[List of messiah claimants|would-be]] [[Messiah]]s and [[prophet]]s.\n* [[Fringe science]]\n* [[Hoax]]es\n* [[Millennialism]], [[eschatology]], and cases of [[mass hysteria]].\n* [[Mutant]]s (human and animal)\n* [[Parapsychology]]\n* Religious phenomena ([[stigmata]], [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena|appearances and simulacra]] and [[miracles]], etc.)\n* Natural [[Simulacrum|simulacra]]\n* [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]]\n* [[Urban legend]]s\n\n''Fortean Times'' also frequently covers the [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s, as well as unusual aspects of mainstream science and research.\n\n===Current content===\nThe magazine's current regular contents include:\n* Three or four feature articles\n* '''Strange Days''', a wide-ranging overview of odd and interesting stories mostly culled from the world's newspapers. Some feature in particular sections, including:\n** ''Science''\n** ''[[Archaeology]]'' (usually by Paul Sieveking and Paul Devereux)\n** [[Ghosts]], in a column titled ''Ghostwatch''\n** ''Alien Zoo'', Dr. [[Karl Shuker]]'s regular discussion of [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] matters\n** ''Necrolog'', obituaries of Fortean-relevant individuals\n** ''Strange deaths'', a long-running round-up of the odd manners in which some people meet their ends\n** ''The UFO Files'': \"Flying Saucery\", is Andy J. Roberts and Dr. [[David Clarke (journalist)|David Clarke]]'s \"regular survey of the latest fads and flaps from the world of [[ufology]]\"; \"UFOcal Points\" is [[Jenny Randles]]' \"round-up of sightings and hot-spots from around the world\"\n:''Clippings for most of Strange Days' stories are requested from, and supplied by, the readers of'' ''FT''\n* '''Mythconceptions''', which [[debunker|debunks]] modern [[myth]]s, [[old wives' tale]]s, etc. (in a similar manner to, for example, [[Snopes.com]])\n* '''Classical Corner''', in which Barry Baldwin reviews Fortean events from ancient times\n* '''Fortean Bureau of Investigation''', which typically revisits and reassesses older Fortean cases\n* '''Forum''', featuring three or four shorter articles on diverse topics\n* '''Reviews''' of Fortean, science fiction/fantasy and related books, films and computer games\n* A letters page, incorporating:\n**''[[Simulacrum|Simulacra]] Corner'', photographs submitted by readers of (typically) naturally occurring objects which appear to be in the shape of something else\n**''\"it happened to me...''\", readers\u2019 stories of strange personal occurrences\n* '''Fortean Traveller''', \u201ca guide to various sites of interest to the traveling Fortean\u201d\n* '''Phenomenomix''', a [[comic strip]] by Hunt Emerson\n\n==Praise and criticism==\nMost of the articles in ''Fortean Times'' are written in the style of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective journalism]], but this is not a mandatory requirement and some articles focus on a specific theory or point of view. Although such articles are presented as the opinion of the author and not the editors (who claim to have no opinions), this has occasionally led to controversy. In January 1997, the magazine ran an article by David Percy under the headline \"FAKE! Did [[NASA]] [[Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations|hoax the moon landing]] photos?\". The article outraged many readers and led to the magazine's most vigorous postbag up to that time.{{fact|date=September 2018}} In August 2000, the magazine's cover headline was \"UFO? The shocking truth about the first flying saucers\". The article in question, by James Easton, proposed a mundane explanation for [[Kenneth Arnold]]'s [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|sighting]] \u2014 [[American white pelican]]s.

Many \u201chot topics\u201d of the day have been discussed, such as the [[alien autopsy|Ray Santilli \"alien autopsy\"]] film at the 1996 UnCon, and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the 1998 event, which also saw [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince discussing [[Knights Templar|Templar]] conspiracies and hidden symbolism in the paintings of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], years before these were turned into mass media subjects by ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. Besides the formal lecture programme, UnCon normally features exhibits by organizations such as the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena]] and the [[Centre for Fortean Zoology]]. The event often ends with a panel discussion, as was the case in 2002 when the subject was ''\"Is Ufology Dead?\"''.

The seventh and last issue was published in 2001.<!-- As per comment by Mike Dash -->\n\nIts website tracks Fortean news stories, holds a small archive of articles and photographs, and supports a busy [[internet forum]] for discussion of Fortean topics.\n\nThe magazine has also occasionally published both academic and lighthearted books on various aspects of Forteana.\n\n==Collections and spin-off books==\nMany of the earliest issues of ''FT'' were collected in book format in the early 1990s. In recent years, the print volumes have been overtaken by digital files, available on CD. In addition, several smaller collections have been compiled on various themes and sold, or given away as 'free gifts' with the magazine. A more academic journal, ''Fortean Studies'', has also been printed and is an ongoing venture. In the late 1990s Polygram Spoken Word released an audio version of several Fortean stories, written and produced by Steve Deakin-Davies and featured Brian Cant and Joanna Bowen amongst its actors, this project was licensed from John Brown Publishing.( (c) 1997 Polygram Record operations ltd, Speaking Volumes no: 5361444)\n\n===Fortean Tomes===\nStarting in the very early 1990s, ''Fortean Times'' produced a number of facsimile editions collecting the earliest issues of the magazine, in their entirety, including advertisements. These collections, prepared and edited for print by Paul Sieveking (including hand-corrections to early typographic errors) are now out-of-print. It further appears that although demand was such to warrant reprints of several volumes, after collecting up to #77 it was decided that the previous volumes had not sold well enough to continue completely up to date. (Concern over the likely cost of reprinting issues in the new full colour format led to a publishing decision to stockpile 500 unbound run-on copies of each number to provide the basis of future reprint editions, and this project resulted in one further collection \u2014 \"Snakes Alive!\", collecting #93\u201397 \u2014 but the in-between issues #78\u201392 have not yet been collected in trade format.)\n\n<small>''(The early collections, like the earliest magazines, were published in smaller, 6.5 x 4.5in format)''</small>\n*''Yesterday's News Tomorrow: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 1\u201315'' ([[John Brown Publishing]], 1992 <small>2nd ed. 1995</small>) {{ISBN|1-870870-26-3}}\n*''Diary of a Mad Planet: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 16\u201325'' ([[John Brown Publishing|John Brown Publishing Ltd]], <small>2nd ed. 1995</small>) {{ISBN|1-870021-25-8}}\n*''Seeing Out the Seventies: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 26\u201330'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1990<ref>Copyright and Introduction date information imply that this was the first book to see publication, possibly followed by \"Diary of a Mad Planet\", and ''then'' \"Yesterday's News Tomorrow\".</ref>) {{ISBN|1-870021-20-7}}\n*''Gateways to Mystery: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 31\u201336'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1993) {{ISBN|1-870870-37-9}}\n*''Heaven's Reprimands: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 37\u201341'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-52-2}}\n*''If Pigs Could Fly: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 42\u201346'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-47-6}}\n*''Fishy Yarns:<ref>Published as a hardback</ref> ''Fortean Times'' Issues 47\u201351'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-48-4}}\n*''Bonfire of the Oddities: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 52\u201356'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1995) {{ISBN|1-870870-61-1}}\n*''Strange Attractors: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 57\u201362'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1996) {{ISBN|1-870870-73-5}}\n<small>''(The later collections were of a larger \u2014 A4 \u2014 size)''</small>\n*''Plumber from Lhasa: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 63\u201367'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1996) {{ISBN|1-870870-79-4}}\n*''Memories of Hell: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 68\u201372'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1997) {{ISBN|1-870870-90-5}}\n*''Mouthful of Mysteries: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 73\u201377'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1998) {{ISBN|1-870870-66-2}}\n*''Snakes Alive!: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 93\u201397'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1998) {{ISBN|1-902212-04-5}}\n**''\"Fortean Times\" Index'' by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] (John Brown Publishing Ltd, October 1997) {{ISBN|1-870870-68-9}}\n\n====CDs====\nIn the mid 2000s (decade), ''FT'' began to release a series of digital archives.

The magazine's tagline is \"The World of Strange Phenomena\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nThe roots of the magazine that was to become ''Fortean Times'' can be traced back to Bob Rickard's discovering the works of [[Charles Fort]] through the secondhand method of reading science-fiction stories:\n:\"[[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]], the editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''  (as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' was then titled), for example,\" writes Rickard \"encouraged many authors to expand Fort's data and comments into imaginative stories.\"<ref name=\"Rickard\">{{cite book | editor-last1=Rickard| editor-first1=Bob| authorlink1 = Bob Rickard| editor-last2=Sieveking |editor-first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Sieveking |date=June 1992 | title=''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'': Fortean Times Issues 1\u201315 | edition=Fortean Tomes, 2nd edition, 1995| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870870-26-3 }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, while Rickard was studying [[Product Design]] at [[Birmingham School of Art|Birmingham Art College]] he met several like-minded [[science fiction]] fans, particularly crediting fellow-student [[Peter Weston]]'s fan-produced ''Speculation'' [[magazine]] as helping him to \"[learn] the art of putting together a [[fanzine]],\" some years before he created his own.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Attending a science fiction [[fan convention|convention]] in 1968, Rickard obtained Ace paperback copies of all four of Fort's books from a stall run by Derek Stokes (later to run [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]] and take a role in the day-to-day running of ''The Fortean Times'').<ref name=\"Rickard\" />\n\nAfter reading an advert in the underground magazine ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' (in 1969) for the \"[[International Fortean Organisation]]\" (INFO), an American group \"founded in 1966... by Paul and Ronald Willis,\" who had acquired material from the original [[Fortean Society]] (started in 1931, but in limbo since the 1959 death of its founder [[Tiffany Thayer]]), Rickard began to correspond with the brothers, particularly Paul. Rickard was instrumental in encouraging the Willises to publish their own Fortean journal \u2013 the \"INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown\" began intermittent publication in Spring, 1967 \u2013 and sent them many British newspaper clippings, although few saw print. \n\nRickard later discovered that the production was fraught behind-the-scenes as Ronald Willis had been seriously ill, Paul thus finding it difficult to \"keep up with things\" on his own.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Ultimately, the Willises were instrumental in inspiring Rickard to create his ''own'' periodical. Ron Willis succumbed to a brain tumour in March 1975.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /><ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=April 1975 | work=The News #9}}</ref> Bearing a date of  November 1973, the first issue of Rickard's self-produced and self-published ''The News'' was available directly from him.\n\n===''The News'' (1973\u20131976)===\nThe magazine which was to continue [[Charles Fort]]'s work documenting the unexplained was founded by [[Bob Rickard|Robert JM \"Bob\" Rickard]] in 1973 as his self-published bi-monthly mail order \"hobbyish newsletter\" miscellany ''The News'' \u2014 \"A Miscellany of Fortean Curiosities\".<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The title is said to be \"a contraction taken from [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''The News from Nowhere''\",<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> (although Rickard may be conflating/confusing Butler's ''[[Erewhon]]'' and [[William Morris]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> ''\"[[News from Nowhere]]\"''). ''The News'' saw fairly regular bi-monthly publication for 15 issues between November 1973 and April 1976. Debuting at 35p (\u00a31.80/$4.50 for a year of 6 issues<ref>Early advertisements promised a monthly, 12-issue subscription for the same price, but monetary and time constraints caused Rickard to move to a bi-monthly schedule, and use any 'extra' monies to merely produce a greater number of pages</ref>) for 20 pages, ''The News'' was produced on Rickard's typewriter, with headings created with [[Letraset]], during (as Rickard says in #2) the late-1970s [[Power outage|blackout]]s. The first issue featured a cover (which would become briefly the unofficial logo of ''The News'') drawn by Rickard from a [[Selfridges]] advert originally created by [[Bernard Partridge]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=November 1973| work=The News #1}}</ref> From the second issue, pictures and photographs from various newspapers were interpolated within the text. The price was raised slightly for #6 \u2014 which also saw the page count upped to 24pg \u2014 due in large part to rising postal and paper costs.\n\nHelping behind the scenes was [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]], a kindred-spirit whom Rickard met at a comics convention when the latter was a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC]]. The two found they had much in common \u2014 including a love of Chinese mysticism \u2014 and Moore helped inspire Rickard to publish ''The News''.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The early issues featured some articles by different individuals, but were \"largely the work of Bob Rickard, who typed them himself with some help from Steve Moore.\"<ref name=\"madplanet\">{{cite book | last1=Sieveking | first1=Paul| authorlink1 = Paul Sieveking | last2=Rickard |first2=Bob |authorlink2=Bob Rickard |last3=Moore |first3=Steve |authorlink3=Steve Moore (comics)|year=1991 | title=''Diary of a Mad Planet'': Fortean Times Issues 16\u201325 | edition=2nd ed. 1995| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870021-25-8 }}</ref>\n\n====Key ''News''-people====\nMoore and Paul Screeton (then editor of ''The Ley Hunter''), both urged on the first few uncertain issues\" and Moore would frequently join Rickard to \"stuff envelopes and hand-write a few hundred addresses\" to disseminate the early issues.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> Rickard also highlights amongst the key early ''Fortean Times'' advocates and supporters: Ion Alexis Will, who discovered ''The News'' in 1974 and became a \"constant [source] of valuable clippings, books, postcards and entertaining letters\"; Janet and Colin Bord, later authors of ''Mysterious Britain'' (Janet also wrote for ''Flying Saucer Review'' and Lionel Beer's ''Spacelink'', while it was Colin's Fortean article in ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'' that is particularly cited by Rickard as bringing him/them to his attention); Phil Ledger, a \"[[nomad|peripatetic]] [[marine biologist]]\", and ''The News''<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"first enthusiastic fan\"; [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]], Fortean theatre director and [[playwright]]; [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]; graphic designer Richard Adams and Dick Gwynn, who both helped with the evolving layout and typesetting of later issues; Chris Squire, who helped organise the first subscription database; Canadian \"Mr. X\"; Mike Dash and cartoonist [[Hunt Emerson]]. Emerson was introduced to Rickard in late 1974, when after seven issues, he \"wanted to improve the graphics\", which Emerson certainly did, providing around 30 headings for use in issues #8 onwards. (Emerson's still-on-going monthly \"Phenomenomix\" strip in ''FT'' had its prototype in #11's three-page \"Fortean Funnies\").<ref name=\"Rickard\" />\n\n====Notable ''News'' content====\nOther early contributors included writer and researcher Nigel Watson (Chairman of the Scunthorpe UFO Research Society 'SUFORS'), who wrote \"Mysterious Moon\" for ''The News'' #2. Watson would later write a regular column of UFO commentary entitled ''Enigma Variations'' (from #29), and articles on the subject of [[UFO]]-related murders and stories of sexual assault by aliens. Phil Grant wrote about [[Ley lines]] for #3 and Mary Caine who revised an earlier article (from ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'') on [[Temple of the Stars|The Glastonbury]] [[Landscape zodiac|Zodiac]] for issue #4, which also saw the debut of the \"Reviews\" section, beginning with comments on a book by [[John Michell]], the Sphere reprint of [[Charles Fort]]'s ''New Lands'' and [[John Sladek]]'s ''The New Apocrypha''.\nIssues #2 and #3 noted that ''The News'' was published \"with an arrangement with INFO\", this was revised from #4 to it being \"''affiliated to'' the [[International Fortean Organisation]]\". From #5, Mark A. Hall produced a section entitled \"Fortean USA\", continuing on from his earlier, discontinued, newsletter ''From My Files''; issue #5 also saw William Porter's article on Llandrillo printed, after being delayed from #4 for space constraints. [[Janet Bord]] contributed \"Some Fortean Ramblings\" alongside [[William R. Corliss]]'s \"The Evolution of the Fortean Sourcebooks\" for #7, and issue #8 was the first issue of Vol. 2, after Rickard decided to end Volume 1 with #7 (not #6 as fully bi-monthly titles do), since that issue was dated November '74, thereby attempting to keep each Volume aligned with a year.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=July 1974| work=The News #5}}</ref>\n\nIssue #8 (or, Volume 2, issue #1) saw the special \"Christmas present\" of headings by [[Hunt Emerson]], after Rickard was introduced to Emerson by Carol and Nick Moore as Hunt was working on ''Large Cow Comix''. Described by Rickard as \"as much a disciple of [[George Herriman|George [Herriman]]]... and my [Rickard's] favourite artists from ''[[Mad Magazine|Mad]]'' ([[Will Elder|Bill Elder]] and [[Wally Wood]])\" as Rickard was of Charles Fort, the two got on well, with Emerson producing not only a series of headings, but later strips and covers for issues right up to the present day.<ref name=\"Rickard\" /> The death of INFO co-founder Ronald J Willis was announced in #9, which described itself as providing \"bi-monthly notes on Fortean phenomena\", and an index to the first year's issues (#1\u20137) became available. Colin Bord penned \"Amazing Menagerie\" for issue #10, while [[Paul Devereux]] and Andrew York x=compiled an exhaustive study of [[Leicestershire]] in \"Portrait of a Fault Area\", serialised in #11\u201312. Issue #11 featured Rickard and Emerson's first \"Fortean Funnies\" cartoon, while #12 saw a price rise to 50p/$1.25, a logo change (from Selfridges' herald-on-horseback to the more descriptive Fort's face-encircled) and a tweaking of its tagline to \"bi-monthly ''news &'' notes on Fortean phenomena.\" Issue #14 first mentioned Rickard and Michell's then-in-production book ''Phenomena!'', which would be more actively trailed from #18. Issue #15 \u2014 now with 28 pages \u2014 announced that Rickard had decided to bow to popular opinion and retitle his miscellany with a more descriptive title. Thus, with a subtitle of \"Portents & Prodigies\", ''Fortean Times'' was born.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=April 1976| work=The News #15}}</ref>\n\n===''Fortean Times'' (since 1976)===\nAfter fifteen issues of ''The News'', issue #16 (1976) saw the magazine renamed ''Fortean Times'', which \"new title emerged from correspondence between Bob Rickard and Paul Willis\" \u2014 the two having talked of creating a Fortean version of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, \"full of weird and wonderful news and read by millions worldwide\".<ref name=\"madplanet\" /> Its cover bore the descriptive text \"Strange phenomena \u2014 curiosities \u2014 prodigies \u2014 portents \u2014 mysteries,\" while the inside cover kept the 'Fort face' logo from later issues of ''The News'' but bore the revised legend \"A Contemporary Record of Strange Phenomena\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=June 1976| work=The Fortean Times #16}}</ref> Included within was an offer for a \"4-colour [[silk-screen]]ed poster\" created by Hunt Emerson for this landmark issue. From the start, this new format compounded earlier financial difficulties for Rickard, following on from #14's plea: \"we need more subscribers or we die!\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=January 1976| work=The News #14}}</ref> (''Fortean Times'' issues #16\u201318 \u2014 as ''The News'' #1\u201315 before them \u2014 were solely edited, published and in large part written & typed by Rickard himself. Even by passing on rising postal and paper costs to the readership \u2014 which Rickard constantly reiterates that he is loath to do, the early ''Fortean Times'' was constantly facing an uphill financial battle.) Early editorials of the new ''FT'', therefore (in fact beginning with ''The News'' #15) featured a notification of donations received, naming and thanking the hardcore readership (which included many current and future-contributors) for monies received, which aided the move towards higher production values. With donations helping to offset costs, the price was held at 50p up until issue #20, whereupon the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule from Spring 1977 (Issue #21) \u2014 but raised the page count (and price) to continue producing the same amount of material for the same yearly fee (40pg, 75p ea. or \u00a33/year).\n\nIssue #18 saw a new semi-regular feature entitled \"Forteana Corrigenda,\" aimed at correcting \"errors in the literature\" that had crept into various Fortean works through misquotation or other difficulties. After 18 more-or-less solo-produced issues, long-term supporter and helper Steve Moore was credited as assistant editor for issues #19\u201321, becoming co-contributing editor (with Phil Ledger, Stan Nichols and Paul J Willis) on issues #22\u201326 and 'associate editor' from issue #27. He was joined by contributing editor David Fideler, and subsequently (also as co-associate editor) by [[Paul Sieveking]] (#28\u2014 ) and Valerie Thomas (#31\u201332). Issue #20 announced that [[Kay Thompson]] (a staff member of ''Ley Hunter'' magazine, then under the editorship of [[Paul Devereux]], with whom ''FT'' shared an address for several issues) would be helping to type parts of subsequent issues to further delegate the burden from Rickard. He, Moore and Sieveking were also later joined editorially by author [[Mike Dash]] (who is mentioned as particularly overseeing the publication of scholarly occasional papers), before Moore moved from full editorial to largely correspondent duties for a dozen issues after #42, returning as a contributing editor in Autumn 1990 (#55). The four \u2014 Rickard, Sieveking, Dash and Moore \u2014 are often collectively referred to as \"The Gang of Fort,\" after the [[The Gang of Four|Gang of ''Four'']].\n\nIssue #21 saw the debut of ''FT'' semi-regular column \"Strange Deaths\" (later descriptively subtitled \"Unusual ways of shuffling off this mortal coil\"), while issue #22 updated ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s to include <small>([[Ivan T. Sanderson]]'s)</small> The Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained (SITU), alongside INFO. Issue #23 featured an article by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] on, aptly, \"[[23 (numerology)|The 23 Phenomenon]],\"<ref>Wilson, Robert Anton.

With #24, the printers were changed to Windhorse Press to overcome this difficulty, and ''FT'' became officially 52 pages in length, the changes cemented in issue #25 with a new font for the title and a change of address \u2014 c/o London-based \"SF and cosmic\" bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed]], run by Derek Stokes (who had sold Rickard the four Fort books ten years previously). The same issue ran an obituary for [[Eric Frank Russell]], of whom Rickard was a considerable fan. He writes that Russell turned down an invitation to contribute material to ''The News'' back in 1973, having \"earned his rest\" after 40 years as an active Fortean. Rickard further states that Russell was one of the key Fortean-fiction writers he read in [[John W. Campbell|Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''  and ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', and the author of \"the first Fortean book I [Rickard] ever read\": Russell's ''Great World Mysteries''.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Obituaries cont.| date=Spring 1978| work=Fortean Times #25, p. 43}}</ref> Issue #26 trailed \"a special series of 'Occasional Papers' in Fortean subjects\" to be edited by Steve Moore, and #27 \u2014 the 5th Anniversary issue \u2014 welcomed Michigan-native David Fideler (whose ''Anomaly Research Bulletin'' was then due to cease publication, although its subscribers, ''FT'' promised, would be absorbed by them) as ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"man in the New World\".\n\n====Paul Sieveking and ''FT''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s format change====\nIn 1978, mutual friend Ion Will introduced Rickard to [[Paul Sieveking]], who recalls that \"the Forteans used to meet every Tuesday afternoon above the science-fiction bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]] in Soho, a shop run by Derek Stokes, to open post and interact. (Indeed, this was the semi-official address of ''FT'' until that shop closed. With #35, Summer '81 the address was changed.) Sieveking joined the ''FT'' team with #28 as co-associate editor, and writes, highlighting the intrinsic early difficulties in printing ''FT'' that that issue \"was printed by an Israeli entrepreneur in northern Greece and shipped to London.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1=Sieveking | first1=Paul| authorlink1 = Paul Sieveking | last2=Rickard |first2=Bob |authorlink2=Bob Rickard |last3=Moore |first3=Steve |authorlink3=Steve Moore (comics) |date=April 1990 | title=''Seeing Out the Seventies'': Fortean Times Issues 26\u201330 | edition=Fortean Tomes 1990| publisher=John Brown Publishing | isbn=1-870021-20-7 }}</ref> That issue (#28), bearing a cover blurb of \"Strange Phenomena\", featured an early advert for the bookshop [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]], drawn by [[Bryan Talbot]], while the editorial promised that the ''next'' issue would not only see the availability of Index 1976, but be in a \"larger and more professional format, typeset throughout, [with] better graphics, layout and legibility.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Winter 1979 | work=Fortean Times #28}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, #29, under a cover by Hunt Emerson,<ref>The cover would later be used for the ''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'' collection of ''The News'' issues #1\u201315.</ref> was printed fully typeset in A4 (thanks to art director Richard Adams of AdCo and, according to Rickard's preface to ''Yesterday's News Tomorrow'', Dick Gwynn) and even distributed on a limited basis through [[WH Smiths]]. The move away from production on Rickard's typewriter gave \"The ''Journal'' of Strange Phenomena,\" (as it was now subtitled) greater ability to produce longer, better laid-out articles. These opened with a seven-page guide to \"Charles Fort and Fortean Times\" by Bob Rickard, explaining the background and philosophy of ''FT'' as well as outlining the influence of Fort \"who\", writes Rickard, \"is still largely unknown\",<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Charles Fort and Fortean Times| date=Summer 1979 | work=Fortean Times #29}}</ref> and also included the first of Nigel Watson's \"Enigma Variations\" columns and [[Loren Coleman]]'s \"Devil Names and Fortean Places\" article sat alongside comments by Colin Bord, [[Tim Dinsdale]], [[Vernon Harrison|VGW Harrison]] and Rickard on [[Anthony 'Doc' Shiels]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> 1977 \"[[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]\" photographs. The magazine itself dropped the description 'non-profitmaking' from its publication information, and ceased to name its stated-affiliations to INFO and SITU and 'other Fortean journals' in favour the more general aim to be a \"friend to all groups and magazines continuing the work of Charles Fort\".<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Summer 1979 | work=Fortean Times #29}}</ref> It also contained a considerably higher number of adverts, including both inside covers \u2014 making the page count slightly higher than previous issues, which had previously counted the cover as page 1 \u2014 and an early advert by [[Brian Bolland]] for [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] (which would ironically begin to take off only after the closure of Stokes's [[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed (bookshop)|Dark They Were And Golden-Eyed]]).\n\nIssue #30 announced that while \"over the last couple of issues [the] subscriber list... nearly doubled,\" so too had the \"printing, production and postage bill,\" necessitating a price rise to 95p/$2.50 \u2014 albeit softened by another length increase, to 68 pages. Now published not merely by Rickard, but by 'Fortean Times Ltd', it was typeset by Warpsmith Graphics and printed by Bija Press. The cover was painted by Una Woodruff (whose ''Inventorum Natura'' was reviewed within) to illustrate [[John Michell]]'s article on \"Spontaneous Images and Acheropites,\" drawing on his 1979 [[Thames & Hudson]] book dealing with \u2014 and titled \u2014 \"''[[Simulacra]]''\". Bob Rickard produced an article on one \"[[Clemente Dominguez]]: Pope, [[heresy|Heretic]], [[Stigmata|Stigmatic]];\" [[Michael A. Hoffman II|Michael Hoffman]] speculated on the occult aspects of a serial killer in \"[[The Son of Sam|The Sun of Sam]];\" Robert J. Schadewald wrote about \"The Great [[Raining animals|Fish Fall]] of 1859\" while [[Hunt Emerson]] produced the first cartoon strip under the title \"Phenomenomix\".\n\nSieveking took over full editorial duties from Rickard with #43, helming the subsequent four quarterly issues (to #46) to give Rickard a chance to \"revitalize\",<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Rickard | title=Editorial| date=Autumn 1984 | work=The Fortean Times #42}}</ref> which he did, returning with #46 to the position of co-editor. Moore, Dash and Ian Simmons (and others) variously edited the magazine for the next 18+ years, and although main editorship passed from Rickard and Sieveking to [[David Sutton (writer)|David Sutton]] in 2002, they both continue to contribute \u2014 Sieveking continues as before, editing and writing most of the Strange Days news section and editing the letters pages, and acting as the main quality-control proof-reader, as well as producing the occasional feature (while Sieveking's wife edits the \"Reviews\" section).\n\nDuring the 40+ years of its publication, ''Fortean Times'' has changed both format and publishers on a few occasions. Early issues (particularly of ''The News'') were produced in black & white (for ease of photocopying), and the whole was largely produced by [[typewriter]] until #29. Colour, professional printing (and wider distribution) followed and a 6.5 x 4.5in size held sway for several years before the magazine settled into its \"normal\" A4 (magazine) size in the 1980s, after which glossy covers followed. Several changes of logo and font have occurred throughout its life.\n\n==General content==\nThe identification of correct original sources by contributors is a defining feature of the magazine, as it was for Charles Fort himself. However, the \"objective reality\" of these reports is not as important.  The magazine \"maintains a position of benevolent scepticism towards both the orthodox and the unorthodox\" and \"[[Toe the line|toes no party line]]\". \nThe range of subject matter is extremely broad including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n* General [[Forteana]]\n* Anomalous phenomena\n* [[Vision (spirituality)|Apparitions]]\n* Bizarre deaths\n* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Crop circle]]s\n* [[Cryptozoology]]\n* [[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]s and [[List of messiah claimants|would-be]] [[Messiah]]s and [[prophet]]s.\n* [[Fringe science]]\n* [[Hoax]]es\n* [[Millennialism]], [[eschatology]], and cases of [[mass hysteria]].\n* [[Mutant]]s (human and animal)\n* [[Parapsychology]]\n* Religious phenomena ([[stigmata]], [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena|appearances and simulacra]] and [[miracles]], etc.)\n* Natural [[Simulacrum|simulacra]]\n* [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]]\n* [[Urban legend]]s\n\n''Fortean Times'' also frequently covers the [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s, as well as unusual aspects of mainstream science and research.\n\n===Current content===\nThe magazine's current regular contents include:\n* Three or four feature articles\n* '''Strange Days''', a wide-ranging overview of odd and interesting stories mostly culled from the world's newspapers. Some feature in particular sections, including:\n** ''Science''\n** ''[[Archaeology]]'' (usually by Paul Sieveking and Paul Devereux)\n** [[Ghosts]], in a column titled ''Ghostwatch''\n** ''Alien Zoo'', Dr. [[Karl Shuker]]'s regular discussion of [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] matters\n** ''Necrolog'', obituaries of Fortean-relevant individuals\n** ''Strange deaths'', a long-running round-up of the odd manners in which some people meet their ends\n** ''The UFO Files'': \"Flying Saucery\", is Andy J. Roberts and Dr. [[David Clarke (journalist)|David Clarke]]'s \"regular survey of the latest fads and flaps from the world of [[ufology]]\"; \"UFOcal Points\" is [[Jenny Randles]]' \"round-up of sightings and hot-spots from around the world\"\n:''Clippings for most of Strange Days' stories are requested from, and supplied by, the readers of'' ''FT''\n* '''Mythconceptions''', which [[debunker|debunks]] modern [[myth]]s, [[old wives' tale]]s, etc. (in a similar manner to, for example, [[Snopes.com]])\n* '''Classical Corner''', in which Barry Baldwin reviews Fortean events from ancient times\n* '''Fortean Bureau of Investigation''', which typically revisits and reassesses older Fortean cases\n* '''Forum''', featuring three or four shorter articles on diverse topics\n* '''Reviews''' of Fortean, science fiction/fantasy and related books, films and computer games\n* A letters page, incorporating:\n**''[[Simulacrum|Simulacra]] Corner'', photographs submitted by readers of (typically) naturally occurring objects which appear to be in the shape of something else\n**''\"it happened to me...''\", readers\u2019 stories of strange personal occurrences\n* '''Fortean Traveller''', \u201ca guide to various sites of interest to the traveling Fortean\u201d\n* '''Phenomenomix''', a [[comic strip]] by Hunt Emerson\n\n==Praise and criticism==\nMost of the articles in ''Fortean Times'' are written in the style of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective journalism]], but this is not a mandatory requirement and some articles focus on a specific theory or point of view. Although such articles are presented as the opinion of the author and not the editors (who claim to have no opinions), this has occasionally led to controversy. In January 1997, the magazine ran an article by David Percy under the headline \"FAKE! Did [[NASA]] [[Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations|hoax the moon landing]] photos?\". The article outraged many readers and led to the magazine's most vigorous postbag up to that time.{{fact|date=September 2018}} In August 2000, the magazine's cover headline was \"UFO? The shocking truth about the first flying saucers\". The article in question, by James Easton, proposed a mundane explanation for [[Kenneth Arnold]]'s [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|sighting]] \u2014 [[American white pelican]]s. This suggestion so outraged ufologists that many of them still use the term \"pelican\" or \"pelicanist\" as a pejorative term for a [[debunker]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/pelicanindex.htm |title=Pelican Index |access-date=2006-09-23 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20020812153332/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/pelicanindex.htm |archive-date=2002-08-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMost Fortean researchers contribute articles, criticism or letters to the magazine. It has also attracted more widespread coverage and praise. ''Fortean Times'' #69 claims that \"extracts from ''FT'' have featured in at least three publications used for teaching English as a foreign language.\" Lynn Barber of ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper described writing in ''FT'' as \"a model of elegant English.\"<ref>{{cite news | first1=Bob | last1=Rickard |first2=Paul | last2=Sieveking | title=Editorial| date=June\u2013July 1993| work=Fortean Times | number = 69 |page= 4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Lynn | last=Barber | title= [Unknown]| date=25 April 1993 | work=The Independent on Sunday |publisher=| url=|accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==UnConvention==\nThe magazine has organised an \"UnConvention\" (or ''UnCon''), most years since 1994 (the \"missing\" years being 2001, 2005 and 2009), at various venues in [[London]] (the [[University of London Union]], the [[Institute of Education]], the [[Commonwealth Institute]] and, in recent years, [[Friends House]]). Many \u201chot topics\u201d of the day have been discussed, such as the [[alien autopsy|Ray Santilli \"alien autopsy\"]] film at the 1996 UnCon, and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the 1998 event, which also saw [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince discussing [[Knights Templar|Templar]] conspiracies and hidden symbolism in the paintings of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], years before these were turned into mass media subjects by ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. Besides the formal lecture programme, UnCon normally features exhibits by organizations such as the [[Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena]] and the [[Centre for Fortean Zoology]]. The event often ends with a panel discussion, as was the case in 2002 when the subject was ''\"Is Ufology Dead?\"''. This was widely reported in the British media as an \"official\" statement by ''Fortean Times'' that \"Ufology is Dead\".<ref name=\"FT160\">{{citation| title=Saucers Smeared | first1=Bob |last1= Rickard | first2=Paul |last2 = Sieveking | work = Fortean Times |number= 160 |date= July 2002 | page= 4}}</ref>\n\n==Related projects==\n''Fortean Studies'', the magazines more-academic sister-publication published yearly volumes in the late 1990s. The seventh and last issue was published in 2001.<!-- As per comment by Mike Dash -->\n\nIts website tracks Fortean news stories, holds a small archive of articles and photographs, and supports a busy [[internet forum]] for discussion of Fortean topics.\n\nThe magazine has also occasionally published both academic and lighthearted books on various aspects of Forteana.\n\n==Collections and spin-off books==\nMany of the earliest issues of ''FT'' were collected in book format in the early 1990s. In recent years, the print volumes have been overtaken by digital files, available on CD. In addition, several smaller collections have been compiled on various themes and sold, or given away as 'free gifts' with the magazine. A more academic journal, ''Fortean Studies'', has also been printed and is an ongoing venture. In the late 90's Polygram Spoken Word released an audio version of several Fortean stories, written and produced by Steve Deakin-Davies and featured Brian Cant and Joanna Bowen amongst its actors, this project was licensed from John Brown Publishing.( (c) 1997 Polygram Record operations ltd, Speaking Volumes no: 5361444)\n\n===Fortean Tomes===\nStarting in the very early 1990s, ''Fortean Times'' produced a number of facsimile editions collecting the earliest issues of the magazine, in their entirety, including advertisements. These collections, prepared and edited for print by Paul Sieveking (including hand-corrections to early typographic errors) are now out-of-print. It further appears that although demand was such to warrant reprints of several volumes, after collecting up to #77 it was decided that the previous volumes had not sold well enough to continue completely up to date. (Concern over the likely cost of reprinting issues in the new full colour format led to a publishing decision to stockpile 500 unbound run-on copies of each number to provide the basis of future reprint editions, and this project resulted in one further collection \u2014 \"Snakes Alive!\", collecting #93\u201397 \u2014 but the in-between issues #78\u201392 have not yet been collected in trade format.)\n\n<small>''(The early collections, like the earliest magazines, were published in smaller, 6.5 x 4.5in format)''</small>\n*''Yesterday's News Tomorrow: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 1\u201315'' ([[John Brown Publishing]], 1992 <small>2nd ed. 1995</small>) {{ISBN|1-870870-26-3}}\n*''Diary of a Mad Planet: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 16\u201325'' ([[John Brown Publishing|John Brown Publishing Ltd]], <small>2nd ed. 1995</small>) {{ISBN|1-870021-25-8}}\n*''Seeing Out the Seventies: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 26\u201330'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1990<ref>Copyright and Introduction date information imply that this was the first book to see publication, possibly followed by \"Diary of a Mad Planet\", and ''then'' \"Yesterday's News Tomorrow\".</ref>) {{ISBN|1-870021-20-7}}\n*''Gateways to Mystery: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 31\u201336'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1993) {{ISBN|1-870870-37-9}}\n*''Heaven's Reprimands: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 37\u201341'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-52-2}}\n*''If Pigs Could Fly: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 42\u201346'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-47-6}}\n*''Fishy Yarns:<ref>Published as a hardback</ref> ''Fortean Times'' Issues 47\u201351'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1994) {{ISBN|1-870870-48-4}}\n*''Bonfire of the Oddities: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 52\u201356'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1995) {{ISBN|1-870870-61-1}}\n*''Strange Attractors: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 57\u201362'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1996) {{ISBN|1-870870-73-5}}\n<small>''(The later collections were of a larger \u2014 A4 \u2014 size)''</small>\n*''Plumber from Lhasa: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 63\u201367'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1996) {{ISBN|1-870870-79-4}}\n*''Memories of Hell: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 68\u201372'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1997) {{ISBN|1-870870-90-5}}\n*''Mouthful of Mysteries: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 73\u201377'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1998) {{ISBN|1-870870-66-2}}\n*''Snakes Alive!: ''Fortean Times'' Issues 93\u201397'' (John Brown Publishing Ltd, 1998) {{ISBN|1-902212-04-5}}\n**''\"Fortean Times\" Index'' by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] (John Brown Publishing Ltd, October 1997) {{ISBN|1-870870-68-9}}\n\n====CDs====\nIn the mid 2000s (decade), ''FT'' began to release a series of digital archives.
