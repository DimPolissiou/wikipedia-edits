There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands.

We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words.

The rebels were joined by wealthy peasants from the villages, which suppressed the Committees of the Poor, and committed massacres against rural activists. Eyewitnesses reported atrocities in villages such as Ivanchug, Chagan, Karalat. In response, Soviet forces led by Kirov undertook to suppress this revolt in the villages, and together with the Committees of the Poor restored Soviet power. The revolt in Astrakhan was brought under control by 10 March, and completely defeated by the 12th. More than 184 were sentenced to death, including monarchists, and representatives of the Kadets, Left-Socialist Revolutionaries, repeat offenders, and persons shown to have links with British and American intelligence services.<ref>\u041c.\u0410\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0412.\u0416\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439.

After the condemned were stripped of their clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or dispatched individually with a revolver. Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with corpses and soaked with blood.

It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\" <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands.

The [[Pyatigorsk]] Cheka organized a \"day of Red Terror\" to execute 300 people in one day, and took quotas from each part of town.

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\" <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

It is the sequel to ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 15th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Written and directed by [[James Gunn]], the film stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Michael Rooker]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Pom Klementieff]], [[Elizabeth Debicki]], [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]], [[Sean Gunn]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], and [[Kurt Russell]]. In ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'', the Guardians travel throughout the cosmos as they help [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] learn more about his mysterious parentage.\n\nThe film was officially announced at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] before the theatrical release of the first film, along with James Gunn's return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. James Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. It grossed more than $863&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2017 in film|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2017]], while also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received praise for its visuals, direction, soundtrack, humor, and performances (particularly those of Rooker and Russell), though some critics deemed it inferior to the original. It received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]]. A sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'' is in development, with Gunn returning as writer and director.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 2014, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baby Groot]] are renowned as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]], leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. The drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayesha hires [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]] and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for [[Human trafficking|child trafficking]], to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his assistant [[Kraglin]] questions his objectivity, and his lieutenant [[Taserface]] leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship, and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father, [[Thanos]]. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and Kraglin, the latter having never intended to start the mutiny, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, but Taserface warns the Sovereign before dying.\n\nEgo, a god-like [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form this \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother [[Meredith Quill|Meredith]]. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate the Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can [[Terraforming|terraform]] into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumor that killed her due to the distraction she posed.\n\n[[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], Ego's na\u00efve [[Empath (comics)|empath]] servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the planet's core, as they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Quill loses his Celestial powers soon after Ego's death. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill and dies in the [[Vacuum#Outer space|vacuum of space]]. Meanwhile, Quill realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny. Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again.\n\nIn a series of mid- and [[post-credit scene]]s, Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ravager leader [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]] reunites with his ex-teammates<!-- PER WP:EASTEREGG DO NOT LINK THE OLD GUARDIANS -->; Groot has grown into a teenager;{{refn|name=AdolescentGroot|group=N|Gunn said this sequence with an adolescent Groot is set \"years after\" the ending of the film, with the character appearing in the same state in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"GrootAgePostCredit\"/>}} Ayesha creates a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians, naming him Adam;{{refn|name=Adam|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Adam Warlock]], who director [[James Gunn]] initially planned to feature prominently in the film.

Gunn eventually decided to keep him as \"Baby Groot\", which was one of the reasons the film is set only a few months after the first.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/> Gunn described Baby Groot as the son of Groot from the first film,<ref name=\"BabyGrootSon\"/> with Diesel explaining that \"we're going to see this goofy, adorable, baby Groot [just] kinda learning as he goes.\"<ref name=\"GunnGrootNoMemories\"/><ref name=\"DieselNov2016\"/> [[Property master|Prop master]] Russell Bobbitt created a 1:1 scale model of the {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} Baby Groot for filming, to use as a lighting reference and sometimes as a puppet for the actors to interact with.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/> As Groot only communicates with the phrase \"I am Groot\" in different inflections, Gunn created a \"Groot Version\" of the script for himself and Diesel, which contains each of Groot's lines in English.<ref name=\"GrootScript\"/> Diesel used a higher register of his voice for Baby Groot, which was pitched up by seven to nine [[semitone]]s depending on the take.

He is also the former deputy to Ayesha.<ref name=\"GotG2ConceptArt2\"/> Yondu has a larger head fin in the film, to look closer to his comic counterpart,<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> and Rooker worked with the prosthetic department to add gaps to his prosthetic teeth, \"just like real teeth\", to aid him in whistling as the character.<ref name=\"RookerGI\"/> Rooker explained that, for the sequel, Gunn \"wanted people to experience more in-depth what Yondu was thinking and how he's feeling\u2014a more serious Yondu.\" Rooker noted the complex relationship between Yondu and Quill where \"we don't agree on things...they are constantly at each other's throats [but] Yondu truly cares about this kid.\"<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/> Gunn was reluctant to kill Yondu in the film, but ultimately felt that \"this is a story about a father's love for his son, his ultimate love, so much love that he sacrifices himself for that, and that's what Yondu is. He is 100 percent Peter Quill's father\" despite Ego being Quill's biological father.<ref name=\"YonduDeath\"/> Before the release of ''Vol. 2'', Rooker spent time on the set of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) to counteract rumors that the reason his character would not appear in that film was that he would die in this one.<ref name=\"RookerInfinityWar\"/>\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]: <br/>An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as sisters and reluctant member of the Guardians.<ref name=\"NebulaGuardian\"/> Gillan stated the film would further explore the sisterly relationship between Nebula and Gamora,<ref name=\"GillanNov2015\"/> including their backstory \"and what happened to these two girls growing up and actually how awful it was for them and how it has ruined their relationship\",<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> adding \"we're [also] going to start to see how much pain [Thanos] actually caused [Nebula]... we really start to see the emotional crack in her character\".<ref name=\"GillanJan2017\"/> While Gillan had to shave her head for the first film, she only had to shave half of her head for the sequel, taking away the underneath part and leaving the top.<ref name=\"GillanJan2017\"/> Gillan's makeup took two and a half hours to apply, down from five hours for the first film.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/>\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]]: <br/>A member of the Guardians with empathic powers who lives with Ego.<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/><ref name=\"MantisConfirm\"/> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said the character \"has never really experienced social interaction\", and learns about \"social intricacies\" from the other Guardians.<ref name=\"GotG2ConceptArt\"/> Klementieff added, \"She was really lonely and by herself, so it's a completely new thing to meet these people and to discover new things\", comparing this to a child making awkward mistakes in social situations. Mantis and Drax have an \"interesting\" relationship in the film due to both being \"complete odd balls\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> [[Steve Englehart]], Mantis's co-creator, was disappointed with the character's portrayal, saying, \"That character has nothing to do with Mantis ...

When they trust you they give you a wide berth... we just fit.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2015Q&A\"/>\n\nIn May, Gunn said the sequel would feature fewer characters than the first film, and that he had planned to introduce two major new characters in the script\u2014Mantis and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to portray Mantis,<ref name=\"GunnMay2015\"/> while he had decided to remove Warlock due to the film \"getting too busy\", explaining, \"one of the main things with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' is not to add a bunch of characters, not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters... and getting to know them more emotionally... everything is just getting too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies.\"<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> Gunn added, \"I adored what we had done with him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock. But it was one character too many and I didn't want to lose Mantis and Mantis was more organically part of the movie anyway.\"<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/> He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered \"a pretty important part\" of the cosmic side of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/><ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> The character's future introduction is hinted at in one of the film's mid-credits scenes.<ref name=\"WarlockCredits\"/> Gunn noted that Marvel gave him \"some blowback\" for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the character would be appearing in ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', which was not the case. By including the scene, Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that the character would not be seen in either of the Avengers films.<ref name=\"WarlockSceneBlowback\"/>\n\n==== Writing ====\nAfter the film's announcement, Gunn said he knew \"a lot of where I want to go [in the sequel]\",<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\"/> having written the backstory of Peter Quill, his father, and his history with Yondu during the making of the first film with the intention of exploring them in a future film.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/> Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since \"one of the reasons people like ''Guardians'' is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"/> Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax, Nebula, Kraglin, and the Collector, and expand on [[Xandar]]ian, [[Kree]], [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]], and Ravager culture.<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\"/><ref name=\"GunnEWNov2014\"/> He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including \"earthlings\" such as [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]],<ref name=\"ColliderFemaleCharacters\"/> as well as Novas [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]] or [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]], saying, \"I think Quill being the only earthling is important. That serves the entire movie-going audience and not just the handful of Nova [and Carol Danvers] fans.\"<ref name=\"GunnNova\"/>\n\nFeige said exploring Quill's father \"would certainly be part of a next Guardians adventure\", adding \"I think there's a reason we seeded it at the very end of the [first] film like that.\"<ref name=\"FeigeQuillFather\"/> Gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure \"Yondu's place in everything made sense\" in regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill's father would not be [[J'son (comics)|J'son]] as in the comics.<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"/> Gunn \"was less confident [Marvel] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than\" including Ego, since \"adult Groot was the most popular character from the first film and I didn't think they'd want to risk a good thing.\" However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it \"opened the film up\" creatively, allowing Gunn to bring out \"new aspects of our other characters.\"<ref name=\"BabyGrootConfidence\"/> Gunn said Thanos would only appear in the sequel \"if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important thing in ''Guardians 2'', that's for damn sure. There's the Guardians themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are not Thanos.\"<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"/> Feige later confirmed that Thanos would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a \"grander\" return.<ref name=\"FeigeThanos\"/><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\"/> When asked about how the film would connect with the other [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn said, \"I don't feel beholden to that stuff at all. I think it's really about the Guardians and what they are doing.\"<ref name=\"GunnMTVNov2014\"/>\n\nGunn set the film two to three months after the first film<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/><ref name=\"TimeFrame\"/> \"because he felt the group are just such fragile egos and he didn't think this story could start years later.\"<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Major planets visited in the film include Sovereign, Berhart and Contraxia. Feige also stated two or three other worlds would be seen, as well as \"a little bit of Earth in this film, but it's not these characters going to Earth.\"<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> In December 2014, Gunn revealed the story for the film was written, saying, \"It's [still] constantly shifting, but I feel like it's pretty strong. I'm excited about it.\"<ref name=\"GunnCBRDec2014\"/> By early February 2015, Gunn was \"a few short weeks\" away from submitting a full story treatment to Marvel, and said that when he first presented his idea for the sequel to the company they thought it was \"risky\". He described it as \"not really based on anything\" from the comics, being mainly an original story.<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"/><ref name=\"GunnFeb2015\"/> Gunn later referred to the full treatment as a \"scriptment\", \"a 70-page combination of a script and a treatment and it goes through every beat of the movie\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> By April, he was preparing to write the screenplay,<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"/> and in May he was hoping to complete the script before he began work on ''[[The Belko Experiment]]'' in June 2015.<ref name=\"GunnMay2015\"/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gunn promoting ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nOn June 2, 2015, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, and that the film's title would not simply be ''Guardians of the Galaxy 2''.<ref name=\"GunnJune2015\"/> The same week, he confirmed the return of [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], and Cooper as Gamora, Drax, and Rocket, respectively.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> At the end of the month, Gunn announced the film would be titled ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'',<ref name=\"VarietyVol2\"/> saying he \"came up with a LOT of titles for ''Vol. 2.'' But because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is already so wordy, it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after it. I liked ''Vol. 2'' the best, so that's what I stuck on the cover of the screenplay\u2014and, fortunately, [Marvel] liked it.\"<ref name=\"GunnTitleExplain\"/>\n\nIn September 2015, Gunn said in a [[Facebook]] post that he wanted to use [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Sneepers]], an alien race that first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1964, as background characters in the film, but was advised against it by Marvel's legal department because the name was too similar to [[wikt:sn\u00edpur|sn\u00edpur]], the Icelandic word for [[clitoris]].<ref name=\"Sneeper\"/> The Marvel legal department later cleared the use of Sneepers in the film, in part because of all the media coverage Gunn's initial post received.<ref name=\"SneepersOk\"/> At the end of the month, Feige stated casting announcements would be made before the end of 2015,<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\"/> and by the end of October, [[Pom Klementieff]] was cast as Mantis.<ref name=\"MantisConfirm\"/><ref name=\"Klementieff\"/> Also, it was reported that [[Matthew McConaughey]] had recently turned down the role of \"the villain\" in the film,<ref name=\"McConaughey\"/> in favor of ''[[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|The Dark Tower]]'' (2017). McConaughey felt he would have been \"an amendment\" in ''Vol. 2'' in \"a colorful part [made] for another big-name actor.\"<ref name=\"McConaugheyPlayboy\"/> In December, Gunn said that he was corresponding with [[John C. Reilly]] about him reprising his role as [[Nova Corps]]man [[Rhomann Dey]],<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\"/> while [[Kurt Russell]] entered early talks to play Quill's father.<ref name=\"Russell\"/> After the [[death of David Bowie|death]] of [[David Bowie]] in January 2016, Gunn said that there had been discussions for Bowie to appear in the film as a member of Yondu's original crew.<ref name=\"Bowie\"/><ref name=\"BowieRole\"/> Gunn also stated that he had completed the final draft of the script.<ref name=\"FinalDraft\"/> [[Benicio del Toro]], who portrayed the Collector in the first film, expressed interest in portraying the character again, despite Marvel not contacting him about the sequel;<ref name=\"DelToroNo\"/> Gunn explained that the Collector \"just didn't fit\" into ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"GunnApr2016\"/> In early February, comedian [[Steve Agee]] was revealed to be in the film.<ref name=\"Agee\"/>\n\n[[Property master|Prop master]] Russell Bobbitt had difficulty finding the cassette decks that had been used in the first film, and all of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]] headsets they sourced for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on [[eBay]] cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for ''Vol. 2''. Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and \"steampunk-looking weapons and belts\" for the Ravagers;<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/> Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15\u201320 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85\u201395 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt \"a unique piece of art\". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop of a [[Halyomorpha halys|stinkbug]]-inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and \"when he bit down the honey poured out of his mouth\"; similarly, a \"yarrow root\" was designed based on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen.<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nPre-shooting began on February 11, 2016,<ref name=\"GunnPreShoot\"/> at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"SHHypeMar2015\"/> under the working title ''Level Up'',<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> with [[Henry Braham]] serving as [[cinematographer]] and Scott Chambliss as [[production designer]].<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/><ref name=\"Braham\"/> Gunn noted that many of the crew from the first film, such as cinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] and production designer Charles Wood, signed on to work on ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', and due to a late change in production schedule for that film, were unable to work on ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"CrewChange\"/><ref name=\"VarietyGotGReview\"/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 17,<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> with Marvel confirming that Russell had joined the cast, and revealing that [[Elizabeth Debicki]] and [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta, an increase in stage space from what was used for the first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and \"our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements.\" Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a \"1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic\"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the ''Eclector'', which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the \"pleasure planet\" of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from \"a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot\", creating a \"kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow.\" Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of [[chroma key|blue screen]] the actors had to interact with;<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/> this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in [[London]] which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel.<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/>\n\n''Vol. 2'' was the first film to be shot with an [[8K resolution]] camera, the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red]] Weapon 8K.<ref name=\"RedCamera\"/> Braham had wanted to use a different camera than the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Alexa 65]] that had been used for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a \"very big and heavy camera\". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red employees, whom he had a positive experience with working on ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'', and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent three months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming.<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/> For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a [[Phantom Cam]]era was used to film scenes up to 2,000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed.<ref name=\"VultureRavagersEscape\"/> Additional scenes were also shot in [[IMAX]] and its aspect ratio.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called \"a [[Hand-held camera|handheld]] [[Tracking shot|dolly]]\" which allowed \"a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie.\" For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a [[technocrane]], but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is \"so small that you can get it in there next to the actors\".<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/>\n\nIn April 2016, Gunn revealed that Reilly would not be part of the film, and stated that there were many other characters he could not include in the film due to rights issues, saying that [[20th Century Fox]] \"owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters that I'd love to play around with\" such as [[Annihilus]] and [[Kang the Conqueror]].<ref name=\"GunnApr2016\"/> Gunn also planned on filming scenes with [[Glenn Close]], reprising her role as [[Nova Corps|Nova Prime Irani Rael]] from the first film.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/>{{rp|4}} When filming [[Stan Lee]]'s cameo, Gunn also filmed two other cameos with Lee including one for ''Doctor Strange,'' to limit the amount of travel Lee had to do.<ref name=\"GunnNoClose\"/><ref name=\"GunnCameos\"/> Additional filming for ''Vol. 2'' took place in [[Cartersville, Georgia]],<ref name=\"Cartersville\"/> [[List of Oregon state parks|a state park]] north of [[Portland, Oregon]],<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> and in [[St. Charles, Missouri]].<ref name=\"58ThingsCommentary\"/> The [[Georgia International Convention Center]] served as additional soundstage space after pre-production on ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) began at several Pinewood Atlanta soundstages.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on June 16, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\"/>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Russell and Debicki were revealed to be playing Ego, Quill's father, and Ayesha, respectively.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> [[Sylvester Stallone]] was also revealed to be in the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> with his role later revealed as [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]].<ref name=\"Stakar\"/> Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film.<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since \"people were going to figure it out eventually [...] it was better that we took the reins in our own hands\" and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discover who Quill's father is to \"the story and the relationship that these characters have\".<ref name=\"GunnEgoReveal\"/> In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a [[post-credits scene]],<ref name=\"TimeFrame\"/> later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits.<ref name=\"5PostCreditScenes\"/><ref name=\"PostCreditsScenes\"/> Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found \"mortally wounded\" on the ship, but \"it ended up being a little confusing.\"<ref name=\"Gunn6thPostCredit\"/>\n\nIn November, Gillan revealed that the film was undergoing reshoots.<ref name=\"GillanReshoots\"/> That February, it was reported that the film had scored a perfect 100 in [[test screening]]s, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience \"from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'\".<ref name=\"PerfectTestScreening\"/> In March 2017, Gunn revealed that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] would appear in the film,<ref name=\"AdamCarollaPodcast\"/> and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing \"in a much bigger way [than the first film]. I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an [[iPhone]], and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles.\"<ref name=\"GunnGrootDancing\"/> [[Fred Raskin]] and [[Craig Wood (film editor)|Craig Wood]] returned from the first film to serve as editors.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said [[Nathan Fillion]], who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]] in a sequence that would have shown several [[movie posters]] for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays [[Arkon]] and [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]].<ref name=\"Fillion\"/><ref name=\"FillionLeak\"/> Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so did not want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut.<ref name=\"Fillion2\"/> He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he \"was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically.\"<ref name=\"GunnNoClose\"/>\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = Planet Ego.jpg\n| width1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Apollonian gasket.svg\n| width2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Ego's planet (top) was designed to be \"highly geometric\" and made extensive use of [[fractal]]s, including [[Apollonian gasket]]s (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/>\n| footer_align = left\n| footer_background = \n}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Framestore]], [[Weta Digital]], Trixter, [[Method Studios]], [[Animal Logic]], [[Scanline VFX]], Lola VFX, Luma, and Cantina Creative.<ref name=\"GunnVFXVendors\"/> Previsualization was done by The Third Floor.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\"/> Framestore created 620 shots for the film, Weta Digital created 530, Method Studios more than 500, and Animal Logic created 147.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Framestore once again created Rocket and Groot,<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/><ref name=\"THRVFX\"/> with Method Studios, Weta Digital and Trixter also working on Rocket. Framestore rebuilt Rocket \"from the ground up\" for ''Vol. 2'', giving him an updated fur simulation, new facial shapes and phonemes, as well as a new eye rig, which came from a rig used for the character Gnarlack from ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Trixter's work on Rocket included when he sets off a trap for the Ravagers, additionally working on the sequence when Rocket, Yondu and Kraglin jump across space.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Other work from Framestore included creatures, spaceships,<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Ayesha's lair, the space chase, the ''Eclector'' scenes, and the adolescent Groot post-credit scene.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/>\n\nFramestore also created the film's opening sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Despite appearing as a single shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot's dancing in the sequence.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\"/> Framestore animation supervisor Arslan Elver noted that the majority of the opening sequence includes CGI and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot) consisting of actual photography.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/> As with the first film, Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' for consistency, \"this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon\". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore. Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having \"a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen\", but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler 2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company [[Exceptional Minds]] with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning them for their old textures and scratches.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/>\n\nThe destruction of the Ravager ship the ''Eclector'' was handled by Weta Digital.<ref name=\"WetaEclector\"/> Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for [[David Hasselhoff]] for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We tried morphing to a live-action Hoff\u2014but it did not hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version ... and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double ... we didn't want to go to the same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body ... so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide1\"/> Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the [[fractal art]] of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment.<ref name=\"THRVFX\"/><ref name=\"EmpireMar2017\"/> Gunn added that there are \"over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet,\" calling it \"the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it.\"<ref name=\"EmpireMar2017\"/>\n\nAnimal Logic and Method Studios also worked on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic focusing on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's \"not that button\" sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film to work on the story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts \"performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by\" Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Lola VFX worked on [[De-aging in film|de-aging]] Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), as \"he had a lot of the [facial] action\" the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, [[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]], since he had \"big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move[d] and crease[d] as he talk[ed]\", similar to Russell's.<ref name=\"FXGuide1\"/> [[Laura Haddock]], reprising her role from the first film of Meredith Quill in the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character.<ref name=\"58ThingsCommentary\"/> Luma worked on the Sovereign people and their world, and Adam Warlock's cocoon.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (soundtrack)}}\nBy August 2014, Gunn had \"some ideas listed, but nothing for sure\" in terms of songs to include in Quill's ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' mixtape,<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"/> for which he felt \"a little pressure\" due to the positive response to [[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|the first film's soundtrack]]. Gunn added, \"But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"<ref name=\"SoundtrackFeelings\"/> By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script,<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> calling ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\"<ref name=\"GunnSoundtrackDec2016\"/> [[Tyler Bates]] was confirmed to score the film by August 2015, returning from the first film.<ref name=\"Bates\"/> As with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the film.<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\"/><!--This information appears in the embedded video from Gunn at the 32:05 mark.--> Recording for the score occurred in January 2017 at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"GunnScoreJan\"/> ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2'', along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\"/><ref name=\"ScoreReleaseDate\"/> A cassette version of ''Awesome Mix Volume 2'' was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe-edition vinyl LP featuring both ''Awesome Mix Volume 2'' and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017.<ref name=\"CassetteRelease\"/>\n\n== Marketing ==\nIn June 2016, Marvel announced plans for an expanded merchandising program for the sequel, with Groot playing a central role.<ref name=\"GotG2Merch\"/> Gunn ensured the film's female characters received more representation in the merchandise than in the first.<ref name=\"GunnFemaleMerchandise\"/> Paul Gitter, senior vice president of licensing at [[Disney Consumer Products]], said they intended to build ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' into a tentpole franchise. Partners in the campaign included [[Hasbro]], [[Lego]], [[Funko]], [[LB Kids]],<ref name=\"GotG2Merch\"/> [[GEICO]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Go-Gurt]], [[Hanes]], [[Synchrony Bank]], [[Dairy Queen]], [[M&M's]], [[Screenvision]], [[Sprint Corporation]] and [[Wrigley Company]].<ref name=\"DeadlineMarketing\"/> Additionally, Marvel partnered with [[Doritos]] for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create a custom \"limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on [[Amazon.com]], with Doritos also hosting Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles where fans could sing the songs from ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom bags, concert tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\"<ref name=\"DoritosBag\"/>\n\nIn July 2016, Gunn, Pratt and other members of the cast attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\"/> showing footage and revealing additional character information.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> On October 19, a \"sneak peek\" teaser was released ahead of the first full teaser trailer. Ethan Anderton of [[/Film]] felt the teaser was strong, despite not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot,<ref name=\"/FilmTeaser\"/> while ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Esther Zuckerman called it \"an immediate crowd-pleaser\".<ref name=\"AVClubTeaser\"/> According to media-measurement firm [[Comscore]] and its PreAct service, the teaser was the top trailer for the week it released, generating 108,000 new social media conversations.<ref name=\"VarietyTeaserTop\"/> In early December, before Gunn revealed the first teaser trailer at [[Comic Con Experience]] 2016,<ref name=\"TrailerCCXP\"/><ref name=\"TrailerACCDebut\"/> he said that finding scenes and moments to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted in hard choices, since \"people really go through every single little shot and try to figure out what the movie's about. And there's a lot of mysteries in ''Guardians 2''.\"<ref name=\"FirstTeaserDone\"/> Describing the teaser trailer, Jacob Hall of /Film noted that the trailer was able to succeed without giving too much away as it focused on character interactions rather than plot.<ref name=\"/FilmFirstTrailer\"/> The teaser trailer received 81 million views in 24 hours, becoming [[List of most viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|the second-most viewed teaser]] behind ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and largest Marvel Studios teaser ever. Additionally, Sweet's \"Fox on the Run\" reached number one on the [[iTunes]] Rock Chart after featuring in the teaser.<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\"/>\n\nA second trailer aired during [[Super Bowl LI]]. Germain Lussier for [[io9]] called it \"hilarious\",<ref name=\"SuperBowlio9\"/> while Anderton said it was \"one hell of a\" Super Bowl spot, \"one that probably overshadows the game itself for people like me... There's plenty of badass cosmic action, the humor we all love, a stellar soundtrack, and some great new footage from the sequel.\"<ref name=\"SuperBowl/Film\"/> The spot generated the most Twitter conversation volume during the game with 47,800 conversations, according to Comscore, who measured the volume of trailers that aired during the game from the time it aired through the end of the game.

Praising the tone and 1980s references that gave the film a sense fun, Stewart called ''Vol. 2'' an \"antidote to somber superheroes\".<ref name=\"NYPostReview\"/> At ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Michael O'Sullivan gave the film four stars, praising it as being \"funnier, nuttier, and more touching\" than the first film. O'Sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on the original film rather than repeating it, and also noted the use of music as well as \"dazzling\" visuals throughout, describing the film as \"a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all.\"<ref name=\"WPReview\"/> Brian Lowry, writing for [[CNN.com]], criticized the middle portion of the film and its villain, but felt the film fared better than other Marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end, and \"good-natured energy\", saying it \"ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet\u2014rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.\"<ref name=\"CNNReview\"/> For ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Christopher Orr felt the film did not live up to the original, particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that Russell was \"badly miscast\", but the rest of the cast, soundtrack, and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review.<ref name=\"AtlanticReview\"/>\n\nAt ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Todd McCarthy]] said \"''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\"/> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders of the first ''Guardians'' to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [but it's] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\"<ref name=\"LAReview\"/> [[Manohla Dargis]] at ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Anthony Lane in his review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt once Ego was introduced, the film began to suffer from \"the curse of the backstory\" and that the \"point that the movie, which has been motoring along nicely, fuelled by silliness and pep, begins to splutter\" was when Ego's desire for larger meaning is revealed. Lane concluded, \"Let's hope that ''Vol. 3'' recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview\"/>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\"| 2017\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[2017 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi Movie]]\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{won}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref name=\"TeenChoice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/teen-choice-awards-winners-full-list-1029104/item/choice-female-artist-teen-choice-awards-releases-first-wave-2017-nominations-1015332|title=Teen Choice Awards: Complete Winners List|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=August 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6siSEgdnX?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/teen-choice-awards-winners-full-list-1029104/item/choice-female-artist-teen-choice-awards-releases-first-wave-2017-nominations-1015332|archivedate=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi-Movie Actor]]\n| [[Chris Pratt]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi-Movie Actress]]\n| [[Zoe Saldana]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Choice MovieShip\n| Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Dragon Con#The Dragon Awards|Dragon Awards]]\n| Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liptak|first1=Andrew|title=The 2017 Dragon Awards are a far-ranging sci-fi and fantasy reading list|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/16094656/dragon-award-dragoncon-sci-fi-fantasy-books-sad-puppies|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 6, 2017|date=August 4, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Hollywood Film Awards]]\n| Sound Award\n| Dave Acord and [[Addison Teague]]\n| {{won}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref name=\"HollywoodAwards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/hollywood-film-awards-2017-complete-list-winners-sundays-ceremony-kate-winslet-jake-gyllenhaal-allison-janney-sam-rockwell-news/|title=Hollywood Film Awards 2017: Complete list of winners for Sunday's ceremony includes Kate Winslet, Jake Gyllenhaal, Allison Janney, Sam Rockwell|last=Beachum|first=Chris|date=November 3, 2017|publisher=Gold Derby|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|[[8th Hollywood Music in Media Awards|Hollywood Music in Media Awards]]\n| Soundtrack Album\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref>{{cite web |last=Pond |first= Steve |title= Hollywood Music in Media Awards Announces Nominees in Film, TV, & Video Game Music |url=https://www.shootonline.com/spw/hollywood-music-media-awards-announces-nominees-film-tv-video-game-music |accessdate= October 26, 2017 |publisher= Shoot Online |date= October 26, 2017 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Original Song \u2013 Sci-fi, Fantasy, Horror Film\n| \"Guardian's Inferno\" for The Sneepers & [[David Hasselhoff]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Outstanding Music Supervision \u2013 Film\n| Dave Jordan\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[St. Louis Film Critics Association]]\n| Best Soundtrack\n|''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref>{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=Annual StLFCA Awards| url=http://www.stlfilmcritics.org/awards/| accessdate=December 12, 2017| publisher=St. Louis Film Association|date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Washington D.C.

film, he also said he had ideas for a potential third film.<ref name=\"GotG3BasicStory\"/> Despite this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third ''Guardians'' film, saying it would depend on his feelings after making ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films are \"still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say ''Guardians 3'' is [one film that's] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be.\"<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016GotG3\"/> In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film \"for sure. We're trying to figure it out,\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\"/> also adding, \"There are no specific plans for ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''. But we know unless something goes horribly\u2014which is always possible,<!-- \"possibly\" in the source is a misprint, as one can clearly hear Gunn saying \"possible\" in the interview itself. Using \"sic\" here is problematic as we are attributing the quotation to Gunn, and it implies he misspoke. --> you never know\u2014I think that Marvel would want to make another movie.\"<ref name=\"GunnMarch2017Yahoo\"/> He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\"/> The following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''.<ref name=\"GunnVol3Confirm\"/>\n\nHowever, in July 2018, Disney cut ties with Gunn following the resurfacing of old, controversial tweets from Gunn.<ref name=\"GunnFiredTHR\"/><ref name=\"GunnFiredDeadline\"/> Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Cooper, Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Gillan issued a statement in support of Gunn.<ref name=\"CastGunnSupport\"/> Pratt, Klementieff,<ref name=\"Vol32019Filming\"/> and Baut\u0456sta are expected to reprise their roles for a third film,<ref name=\"BautistaVol3\"/> though Bautista threatened to leave if Gunn's script was not used.<ref name=\"BautistaTwitter\"/> Filming had been expected to begin in 2019,<ref name=\"Vol32019Filming\"/> for an expected release in 2020.<ref name=\"GunnFiredTHR\"/><ref name=\"Vol32020Release\"/> In early August, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Disney was in no hurry to find a replacement director for Gunn, and was waiting for an A-list filmmaker to become available, even if it meant pushing the film's original February 2019 production date.<ref name=\"RehireUnlikely\"/> Later that month, production was put on hold.<ref name=\"OnHold\"/> In March 2019, Disney and Marvel Studios reversed course and reinstated Gunn as director. Filming of ''Vol. 3'' will commence once Gunn has completed his work for the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2020.<ref name=\"GunnRehired\"/><ref

A couple weeks back I told you how the Marvel legal department advised against using Sneeper as an alien species in Guardians of the Galaxy because the word is \"similar to the word meaning 'clitoris' in Icelandic.\" Let it be known that I wasn't protesting this decision, I just thought it was funny, so I shared it. But the Marvel legal folks are sweet people and, after all of the online articles about me not being able to use the term Sneeper, they came back and told me that maybe it's not that big a deal after all: Sneeper is cleared for use. So keep an eye out for at least one Sneeper somewhere in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.}}</ref>\n\n<!--<ref name=\"DelToroReturn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/benicio-del-toro-returning-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/|title=Benicio Del Toro Returning For 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u2032|last=Giroux|first=Jack|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6c7wd4LJh?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/benicio-del-toro-returning-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/|archivedate=October 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=\"Klementieff\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/sand-castle-adds-comptons-neil-brown-jr-guardians-2-casts-pom-klementieff-in-mystery-role-mantis-1201597456/ |title='Compton's Neil Brown Jr. Signs on For 'Sand Castle'; Pom Klementieff Joins 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' |last=Lincoln |first=Ross |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=October 29, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ceQlwLYa?url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/sand-castle-adds-comptons-neil-brown-jr-guardians-2-casts-pom-klementieff-in-mystery-role-mantis-1201597456/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McConaughey\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pom-klementieff-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-1201629203/ |title='Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2': Newcomer Pom Klementieff Cast in Mystery Role |last=Kroll |first=Justin |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 28, 2015 |accessdate=October 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cd4eS3rd?url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/pom-klementieff-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-1201629203/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BautistaScript\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2015/11/04/dave-bautista-says-james-gunn-making-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol/ |title=Dave Bautista Says James Gunn Making Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Different |last=Siegel |first=Lucas |publisher=ComicBook.com |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cosZKjvL?url=http://comicbook.com/2015/11/04/dave-bautista-says-james-gunn-making-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol/ |archivedate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GillanNov2015\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/gillan-says-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-fleshes-out-gamora-nebulas-relationship |title=Gillan Says \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" Fleshes Out Gamora & Nebula's Relationship |last=Huver |first=Scott |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 17, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d7NhfrI8?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/gillan-says-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-fleshes-out-gamora-nebulas-relationship |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-gunn-pushes-for-more-gamora-merchandise-talks-guardians-vol-2 |title=James Gunn Pushes For More Gamora Merchandise, Talks \"Guardians Vol 2\" |last=Damore |first=Meagan |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dXMe274f?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-gunn-pushes-for-more-gamora-merchandise-talks-guardians-vol-2 |archivedate=December 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/kurt-russell-guardians-galaxy-chris-pratt-father-1201662266/ |title=Kurt Russell Eyed to Play Chris Pratt's Father in 'Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2' |last=Kroll |first=Justin |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 15, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6do54mrkY?url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/kurt-russell-guardians-galaxy-chris-pratt-father-1201662266/ |archivedate=December 16, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\">{{cite magazine|last=Hewitt|first=Chris|title=Set Phase 3 To Stun|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=United Kingdom|page=21|date=February 2016|quote=Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 (April 28, 2017)...

So far, though, a being so apparently powerful he could wear the Avengers' heads for hats has been curiously unthreatening, preferring to sit in space on what looks like a floating portapotty. Will that change? \"Are you asking if he's going to do more than sit in a chair and smirk?\" laughs Feige. \"Oh, yes. The next time we see Thanos he will not be messing around.

Galaxy]], produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 15th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Written and directed by [[James Gunn]], the film stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Michael Rooker]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Pom Klementieff]], [[Elizabeth Debicki]], [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]], [[Sean Gunn]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], and [[Kurt Russell]]. In ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'', the Guardians travel throughout the cosmos as they help [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] learn more about his mysterious parentage.\n\nThe film was officially announced at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] before the theatrical release of the first film, along with James Gunn's return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. [[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. James Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. It grossed more than $863&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2017 in film|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2017]], while also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received praise for its visuals, direction, soundtrack, humor, and performances (particularly those of Rooker and Russell), though some critics deemed it inferior to the original. It received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]]. A sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'' is in development, with Gunn returning as writer and director.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 2014, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baby Groot]] are renowned as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]], leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. The drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayesha hires [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]] and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for [[Human trafficking|child trafficking]], to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his assistant [[Kraglin]] questions his objectivity, and his lieutenant [[Taserface]] leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship, and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father, [[Thanos]]. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and Kraglin, the latter having never intended to start the mutiny, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, but Taserface warns the Sovereign before dying.\n\nEgo, a god-like [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form this \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother [[Meredith Quill|Meredith]]. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate the Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can [[Terraforming|terraform]] into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumor that killed her due to the distraction she posed.\n\n[[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], Ego's na\u00efve [[Empath (comics)|empath]] servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the planet's core, as they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Quill loses his Celestial powers soon after Ego's death. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill and dies in the [[Vacuum#Outer space|vacuum of space]]. Meanwhile, Quill realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny. Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again.\n\nIn a series of mid- and [[post-credit scene]]s, Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ravager leader [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]] reunites with his ex-teammates<!-- PER WP:EASTEREGG DO NOT LINK THE OLD GUARDIANS -->; Groot has grown into a teenager;{{refn|name=AdolescentGroot|group=N|Gunn said this sequence with an adolescent Groot is set \"years after\" the ending of the film, with the character appearing in the same state in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"GrootAgePostCredit\"/>}} Ayesha creates a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians, naming him Adam;{{refn|name=Adam|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Adam Warlock]], who director [[James Gunn]] initially planned to feature prominently in the film.

It went a different direction than what I thought they were going to go with Drax,\" noting he did not \"think Drax was that significant in the film\". The part \"clicked\" for Bautista after the [[Read-through|table read]] with the other cast.<ref name=\"BautistaCBR\"/> Bautista called Drax \"more funny, driven\" than in the first film,<ref name=\"BautistaColliderJan2017\"/> and having \"a sense of innocence and heartbreak about him\",<ref name=\"USATodayFeb2017\"/> despite \"most people's first perception of Drax [that] he's just a big, muscly brute\".<ref name=\"BautistaColliderJan2017\"/> Bautista's makeup took only 90 minutes to apply, down from four hours for the first film. He would have to sit in a sauna at the end of the day to get the makeup off, after his makeup test was found to be too \"abrasive\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/>\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baby Groot]]: <br/>A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket.<ref name=\"DieselReturn\"/> The character began growing from a [[wikt:sapling|sapling]] at the end of the first film, with [[James Gunn]] intending for him to be fully grown by the sequel. Gunn eventually decided to keep him as \"Baby Groot\", which was one of the reasons the film is set only a few months after the first.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/> Gunn described Baby Groot as the son of Groot from the first film,<ref name=\"BabyGrootSon\"/> with Diesel explaining that \"we're going to see this goofy, adorable, baby Groot [just] kinda learning as he goes.\"<ref name=\"GunnGrootNoMemories\"/><ref name=\"DieselNov2016\"/> [[Property master|Prop master]] Russell Bobbitt created a 1:1 scale model of the {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} Baby Groot for filming, to use as a lighting reference and sometimes as a puppet for the actors to interact with.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/> As Groot only communicates with the phrase \"I am Groot\" in different inflections, Gunn created a \"Groot Version\" of the script for himself and Diesel, which contains each of Groot's lines in English.<ref name=\"GrootScript\"/> Diesel used a higher register of his voice for Baby Groot, which was pitched up by seven to nine [[semitone]]s depending on the take. He also delivered lines slowly to avoid any time stretching issues.<ref name=\"DieselPitchShift\"/> Diesel recorded Groot's voice for sixteen foreign-language releases of the film (up from six in the first film).<ref name=\"DieselForeignLanguage\"/> [[Sean Gunn]] provided on-set reference for adolescent Groot in the post-credit sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/>\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]]: <br/>A member of the Guardians who is a genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> Sean Gunn once again served as the stand-in for the character during filming,<ref name=\"SGunnRocket\"/> with Cooper's performance also referenced.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Sean Gunn said that \"Rocket has the same sort of crisis of faith [that he had in the first film] about whether or not he belongs in this family\",<ref name=\"SGunnRocket2\"/> with James Gunn adding, \"this is really about Rocket coming to terms with accepting his place within a group of people, which probably seemed like a good idea\" when they were heroes together at the end of the first film, but now \"he's just not very comfortable with the idea\". Feige stated that the relationship between Rocket and Groot has changed, saying, \"Groot was Rocket's protector in the first movie, [and now] Rocket is Groot's protector.\"<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/>\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br/>A blue-skinned buccaneer of the Ravagers who is a fatherly figure to Quill<ref name=\"RookerConfirm\"/> and member of the Guardians. He is also the former deputy to Ayesha.<ref name=\"GotG2ConceptArt2\"/> Yondu has a larger head fin in the film, to look closer to his comic counterpart,<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> and Rooker worked with the prosthetic department to add gaps to his prosthetic teeth, \"just like real teeth\", to aid him in whistling as the character.<ref name=\"RookerGI\"/> Rooker explained that, for the sequel, Gunn \"wanted people to experience more in-depth what Yondu was thinking and how he's feeling\u2014a more serious Yondu.\" Rooker noted the complex relationship between Yondu and Quill where \"we don't agree on things...they are constantly at each other's throats [but] Yondu truly cares about this kid.\"<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/> Gunn was reluctant to kill Yondu in the film, but ultimately felt that \"this is a story about a father's love for his son, his ultimate love, so much love that he sacrifices himself for that, and that's what Yondu is. He is 100 percent Peter Quill's father\" despite Ego being Quill's biological father.<ref name=\"YonduDeath\"/> Before the release of ''Vol. 2'', Rooker spent time on the set of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) to counteract rumors that the reason his character would not appear in that film was that he would die in this one.<ref name=\"RookerInfinityWar\"/>\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]: <br/>An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as sisters and reluctant member of the Guardians.<ref name=\"NebulaGuardian\"/> Gillan stated the film would further explore the sisterly relationship between Nebula and Gamora,<ref name=\"GillanNov2015\"/> including their backstory \"and what happened to these two girls growing up and actually how awful it was for them and how it has ruined their relationship\",<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> adding \"we're [also] going to start to see how much pain [Thanos] actually caused [Nebula]... we really start to see the emotional crack in her character\".<ref name=\"GillanJan2017\"/> While Gillan had to shave her head for the first film, she only had to shave half of her head for the sequel, taking away the underneath part and leaving the top.<ref name=\"GillanJan2017\"/> Gillan's makeup took two and a half hours to apply, down from five hours for the first film.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/>\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]]: <br/>A member of the Guardians with empathic powers who lives with Ego.<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/><ref name=\"MantisConfirm\"/> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said the character \"has never really experienced social interaction\", and learns about \"social intricacies\" from the other Guardians.<ref name=\"GotG2ConceptArt\"/> Klementieff added, \"She was really lonely and by herself, so it's a completely new thing to meet these people and to discover new things\", comparing this to a child making awkward mistakes in social situations. Mantis and Drax have an \"interesting\" relationship in the film due to both being \"complete odd balls\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> [[Steve Englehart]], Mantis's co-creator, was disappointed with the character's portrayal, saying, \"That character has nothing to do with Mantis ... I really don't know why you would take a character who is as distinctive as Mantis is and do a completely different character and still call her Mantis.\"<ref name=\"EnglehartMantis\"/>\n* [[Elizabeth Debicki]] as [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]]: <br/>The golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people,<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/><ref name=\"GotG2SDCC2016\"/><ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> a genetically engineered race who are \"gold and perfect and wanting to be physically and mentally impeccable.\" Gunn was \"very specific\" when writing the character, and after casting director Sarah Finn suggested Debicki, Gunn \"knew right away that she was the one\". Gunn highlighted the actress's beauty and {{height|ft=6|in=3}} height. Debicki wore platform shoes to increase her height to {{height|ft=6|in=7}}.<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/>\n* [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] as [[Taserface]]: <br/>The leader of a mutinous group of the Ravagers.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/><ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> Gunn originally posted a photo of the comic book character on his social media after landing ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', calling him \"the dumbest character of all time\" and saying he would never feature the character in a film. After eventually deciding to use the character in the sequel, Gunn felt the character had given himself the name Taserface and is \"a real dumbass\".<ref name=\"Taserface\"/> Sullivan's makeup took two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours to apply each day.<ref name=\"SullivanMakeup\"/>\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin: <br/>Yondu's second-in-command in the Ravagers.<ref name=\"GillanSeanGunnConfirm\"/> Kraglin has an expanded role compared to the previous film\u2014Sean Gunn explained, \"In the first film he did a lot of just saying yes and being at Yondu's side, but in this movie things take a little bit of a different turn as Kraglin has a little bit of a crisis of conscience and has to decide whether he's going to stick with Yondu or join forces with the growing faction of mutineers.\"<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/><ref name=\"SeanGunnDec2016\"/>\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]]: <br/>A high-ranking Ravager who holds a grudge against Yondu.<ref name=\"Stakar\"/> Stallone likened his character's relationship with Yondu to a father-son relationship, and called the confrontation they have in the film \"pretty intense\".<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/> For Stakar's acceptance of Yondu as a Ravager at the end of the film, Gunn asked Stallone to channel the \"That'll do, pig\" line from the film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''.<ref name=\"58ThingsCommentary2\"/> Gunn described Stakar as \"very important to the Marvel Universe\",<ref name=\"AdamCarollaPodcast\"/> and said that \"it's our plan to see more of Stallone\" in future MCU films, though he was not sure then if that would include ''Vol. 3''.<ref name=\"OldTeam\"/>\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]]: <br/>An ancient [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] who is Quill's father.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/><ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> Pratt was the first to suggest to Gunn that he consider Russell for the role; he portrays an avatar of Ego who is more traditionally seen in the comics in his \"Living Planet\" form.<ref name=\"EmpireAug2016\"/> Russell appreciated why he was wanted for the role after seeing Pratt's performance in the first film, feeling \"That's my kinda guy. I know where that kind of goof comes from.\" He added, \"I bring the right things [from previous roles]...I connected the dots from some of the things I've done in the past.\"<ref name=\"RussellSet\"/> Ego replaces Quill's original comic father of [[J'son (comics)|J'son]],<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"/> and was allowed to be used in the film after [[20th Century Fox]] reached a deal with Marvel Studios to return the film rights of Ego for changing the power set of [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]], whom Fox wanted to use in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"EgoRights\"/> Gunn originally thought Marvel held the rights to the character, and stated that, had the deal with Fox not been made, there was \"no back up plan, and it would [have been] nearly impossible to just drop another character in,\" given the extensive work done surrounding the character.<ref name=\"GunnEgoRights\"/> For the film's opening sequence, set in 1980 Missouri, [[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]] served as facial reference for the young Ego.<ref name=\"YoungEgo\"/><ref name=\"PressCredits\"/>\n<!-- Order based on billing block -->\n\nAdditionally, reprising their roles from the first film are [[Laura Haddock]] as [[Meredith Quill]], [[Gregg Henry]] as her father, [[Seth Green]] as the voice of [[Howard the Duck]], and canine actor Fred as [[Cosmo the Spacedog|Cosmo]].<ref name=\"PressCredits\"/><ref name=\"CreditCameos\"/><ref name=\"RTCameos\"/> Members of Yondu's Ravager crew appearing in the film include [[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]] as Retch, [[Jimmy Urine]] as Half-Nut, [[Stephen Blackehart]] as Brahl,<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> [[Steve Agee]] as Gef,<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/><ref name=\"Agee\"/> Mike Escamilla as Scrote,<ref name=\"Escamilla\"/> Joe Fria as Oblo, Terence Rosemore as Narblik,<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> and [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Tullk,<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/><ref name=\"Flanagan\"/><ref name=\"FlanaganRole\"/> as well as [[Charred Walls of the Damned]] drummer and ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'' personality [[Richard Christy]] in a cameo appearance.<ref name=\"Christy\"/> The other members of Stakar and Yondu's old team, based on the comic's [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|original incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy]], include [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as [[Martinex]], [[Ving Rhames]] as [[Charlie-27]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Aleta Ogord]].<ref name=\"OldTeam\"/><ref name=\"RTCameos\"/> Also included in the team are the CG characters [[Krugarr]] and [[Mainframe (comics)#Earth-691|Mainframe]], with the latter voiced, in an uncredited cameo, by [[Miley Cyrus]].<ref name=\"OldTeam\"/><ref name=\"Cyrus\"/> Rosenbaum had previously auditioned to play Peter Quill in ''Vol. 1''.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\"/> Gunn cast Yeoh because of his love of 1990s [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]],<ref name=\"OldTeam2\"/> and Cyrus after admiring \"the tone of her voice\" while watching her as a judge on ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]''.<ref name=\"Cyrus\"/> He added that the team would return in future MCU films alongside Stallone's Stakar.<ref name=\"OldTeam\"/>\n\n[[Stan Lee]] appears as an informant to the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], discussing previous adventures that include his cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a [[FedEx]] delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"LeeCameo3\"/> This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,<ref name=\"LeeCameo2\"/> with Gunn noting that \"people thought Stan Lee is a Watcher and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU.\"<ref name=\"LeeCameo3\"/><ref name=\"LeeCameo2\"/> Feige added that Lee \"clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films.

I've never been told to put in any character or plot element at all... When they trust you they give you a wide berth... we just fit.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2015Q&A\"/>\n\nIn May, Gunn said the sequel would feature fewer characters than the first film, and that he had planned to introduce two major new characters in the script\u2014Mantis and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to portray Mantis,<ref name=\"GunnMay2015\"/> while he had decided to remove Warlock due to the film \"getting too busy\", explaining, \"one of the main things with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' is not to add a bunch of characters, not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters... and getting to know them more emotionally... everything is just getting too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies.\"<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> Gunn added, \"I adored what we had done with him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock. But it was one character too many and I didn't want to lose Mantis and Mantis was more organically part of the movie anyway.\"<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/> He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered \"a pretty important part\" of the cosmic side of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"/><ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> The character's future introduction is hinted at in one of the film's mid-credits scenes.<ref name=\"WarlockCredits\"/> Gunn noted that Marvel gave him \"some blowback\" for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the character would be appearing in ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', which was not the case. By including the scene, Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that the character would not be seen in either of the Avengers films.<ref name=\"WarlockSceneBlowback\"/>\n\n==== Writing ====\nAfter the film's announcement, Gunn said he knew \"a lot of where I want to go [in the sequel]\",<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\"/> having written the backstory of Peter Quill, his father, and his history with Yondu during the making of the first film with the intention of exploring them in a future film.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/> Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since \"one of the reasons people like ''Guardians'' is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"/> Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax, Nebula, Kraglin, and the Collector, and expand on [[Xandar]]ian, [[Kree]], [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]], and Ravager culture.<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\"/><ref name=\"GunnEWNov2014\"/> He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including \"earthlings\" such as [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]],<ref name=\"ColliderFemaleCharacters\"/> as well as Novas [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]] or [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]], saying, \"I think Quill being the only earthling is important. That serves the entire movie-going audience and not just the handful of Nova [and Carol Danvers] fans.\"<ref name=\"GunnNova\"/>\n\nFeige said exploring Quill's father \"would certainly be part of a next Guardians adventure\", adding \"I think there's a reason we seeded it at the very end of the [first] film like that.\"<ref name=\"FeigeQuillFather\"/> Gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure \"Yondu's place in everything made sense\" in regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill's father would not be [[J'son (comics)|J'son]] as in the comics.<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"/> Gunn \"was less confident [Marvel] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than\" including Ego, since \"adult Groot was the most popular character from the first film and I didn't think they'd want to risk a good thing.\" However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it \"opened the film up\" creatively, allowing Gunn to bring out \"new aspects of our other characters.\"<ref name=\"BabyGrootConfidence\"/> Gunn said Thanos would only appear in the sequel \"if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important thing in ''Guardians 2'', that's for damn sure. There's the Guardians themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are not Thanos.\"<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"/> Feige later confirmed that Thanos would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a \"grander\" return.<ref name=\"FeigeThanos\"/><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\"/> When asked about how the film would connect with the other [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn said, \"I don't feel beholden to that stuff at all. I think it's really about the Guardians and what they are doing.\"<ref name=\"GunnMTVNov2014\"/>\n\nGunn set the film two to three months after the first film<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/><ref name=\"TimeFrame\"/> \"because he felt the group are just such fragile egos and he didn't think this story could start years later.\"<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Major planets visited in the film include Sovereign, Berhart and Contraxia. Feige also stated two or three other worlds would be seen, as well as \"a little bit of Earth in this film, but it's not these characters going to Earth.\"<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"/> In December 2014, Gunn revealed the story for the film was written, saying, \"It's [still] constantly shifting, but I feel like it's pretty strong. I'm excited about it.\"<ref name=\"GunnCBRDec2014\"/> By early February 2015, Gunn was \"a few short weeks\" away from submitting a full story treatment to Marvel, and said that when he first presented his idea for the sequel to the company they thought it was \"risky\". He described it as \"not really based on anything\" from the comics, being mainly an original story.<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"/><ref name=\"GunnFeb2015\"/> Gunn later referred to the full treatment as a \"scriptment\", \"a 70-page combination of a script and a treatment and it goes through every beat of the movie\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> By April, he was preparing to write the screenplay,<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"/> and in May he was hoping to complete the script before he began work on ''[[The Belko Experiment]]'' in June 2015.<ref name=\"GunnMay2015\"/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gunn promoting ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nOn June 2, 2015, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, and that the film's title would not simply be ''Guardians of the Galaxy 2''.<ref name=\"GunnJune2015\"/> The same week, he confirmed the return of [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], and Cooper as Gamora, Drax, and Rocket, respectively.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> At the end of the month, Gunn announced the film would be titled ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'',<ref name=\"VarietyVol2\"/> saying he \"came up with a LOT of titles for ''Vol. 2.'' But because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is already so wordy, it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after it. I liked ''Vol. 2'' the best, so that's what I stuck on the cover of the screenplay\u2014and, fortunately, [Marvel] liked it.\"<ref name=\"GunnTitleExplain\"/>\n\nIn September 2015, Gunn said in a [[Facebook]] post that he wanted to use [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Sneepers]], an alien race that first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1964, as background characters in the film, but was advised against it by Marvel's legal department because the name was too similar to [[wikt:sn\u00edpur|sn\u00edpur]], the Icelandic word for [[clitoris]].<ref name=\"Sneeper\"/> The Marvel legal department later cleared the use of Sneepers in the film, in part because of all the media coverage Gunn's initial post received.<ref name=\"SneepersOk\"/> At the end of the month, Feige stated casting announcements would be made before the end of 2015,<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\"/> and by the end of October, [[Pom Klementieff]] was cast as Mantis.<ref name=\"MantisConfirm\"/><ref name=\"Klementieff\"/> Also, it was reported that [[Matthew McConaughey]] had recently turned down the role of \"the villain\" in the film,<ref name=\"McConaughey\"/> in favor of ''[[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|The Dark Tower]]'' (2017). McConaughey felt he would have been \"an amendment\" in ''Vol. 2'' in \"a colorful part [made] for another big-name actor.\"<ref name=\"McConaugheyPlayboy\"/> In December, Gunn said that he was corresponding with [[John C. Reilly]] about him reprising his role as [[Nova Corps]]man [[Rhomann Dey]],<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\"/> while [[Kurt Russell]] entered early talks to play Quill's father.<ref name=\"Russell\"/> After the [[death of David Bowie|death]] of [[David Bowie]] in January 2016, Gunn said that there had been discussions for Bowie to appear in the film as a member of Yondu's original crew.<ref name=\"Bowie\"/><ref name=\"BowieRole\"/> Gunn also stated that he had completed the final draft of the script.<ref name=\"FinalDraft\"/> [[Benicio del Toro]], who portrayed the Collector in the first film, expressed interest in portraying the character again, despite Marvel not contacting him about the sequel;<ref name=\"DelToroNo\"/> Gunn explained that the Collector \"just didn't fit\" into ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"GunnApr2016\"/> In early February, comedian [[Steve Agee]] was revealed to be in the film.<ref name=\"Agee\"/>\n\n[[Property master|Prop master]] Russell Bobbitt had difficulty finding the cassette decks that had been used in the first film, and all of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]] headsets they sourced for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on [[eBay]] cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for ''Vol. 2''. Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and \"steampunk-looking weapons and belts\" for the Ravagers;<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\"/> Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15\u201320 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85\u201395 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt \"a unique piece of art\". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop of a [[Halyomorpha halys|stinkbug]]-inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and \"when he bit down the honey poured out of his mouth\"; similarly, a \"yarrow root\" was designed based on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen.<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nPre-shooting began on February 11, 2016,<ref name=\"GunnPreShoot\"/> at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"SHHypeMar2015\"/> under the working title ''Level Up'',<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> with [[Henry Braham]] serving as [[cinematographer]] and Scott Chambliss as [[production designer]].<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/><ref name=\"Braham\"/> Gunn noted that many of the crew from the first film, such as cinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] and production designer Charles Wood, signed on to work on ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', and due to a late change in production schedule for that film, were unable to work on ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"CrewChange\"/><ref name=\"VarietyGotGReview\"/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 17,<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> with Marvel confirming that Russell had joined the cast, and revealing that [[Elizabeth Debicki]] and [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta, an increase in stage space from what was used for the first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and \"our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements.\" Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a \"1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic\"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the ''Eclector'', which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the \"pleasure planet\" of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from \"a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot\", creating a \"kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow.\" Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of [[chroma key|blue screen]] the actors had to interact with;<ref name=\"PressNotes\"/> this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in [[London]] which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel.<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/>\n\n''Vol. 2'' was the first film to be shot with an [[8K resolution]] camera, the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red]] Weapon 8K.<ref name=\"RedCamera\"/> Braham had wanted to use a different camera than the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Alexa 65]] that had been used for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a \"very big and heavy camera\". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red employees, whom he had a positive experience with working on ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'', and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent three months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming.<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/> For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a [[Phantom Cam]]era was used to film scenes up to 2,000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed.<ref name=\"VultureRavagersEscape\"/> Additional scenes were also shot in [[IMAX]] and its aspect ratio.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called \"a [[Hand-held camera|handheld]] [[Tracking shot|dolly]]\" which allowed \"a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie.\" For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a [[technocrane]], but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is \"so small that you can get it in there next to the actors\".<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\"/>\n\nIn April 2016, Gunn revealed that Reilly would not be part of the film, and stated that there were many other characters he could not include in the film due to rights issues, saying that [[20th Century Fox]] \"owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters that I'd love to play around with\" such as [[Annihilus]] and [[Kang the Conqueror]].<ref name=\"GunnApr2016\"/> Gunn also planned on filming scenes with [[Glenn Close]], reprising her role as [[Nova Corps|Nova Prime Irani Rael]] from the first film.<ref name=\"GunnSet\"/>{{rp|4}} When filming [[Stan Lee]]'s cameo, Gunn also filmed two other cameos with Lee including one for ''Doctor Strange,'' to limit the amount of travel Lee had to do.<ref name=\"GunnNoClose\"/><ref name=\"GunnCameos\"/> Additional filming for ''Vol. 2'' took place in [[Cartersville, Georgia]],<ref name=\"Cartersville\"/> [[List of Oregon state parks|a state park]] north of [[Portland, Oregon]],<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> and in [[St. Charles, Missouri]].<ref name=\"58ThingsCommentary\"/> The [[Georgia International Convention Center]] served as additional soundstage space after pre-production on ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) began at several Pinewood Atlanta soundstages.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"/> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on June 16, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\"/>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Russell and Debicki were revealed to be playing Ego, Quill's father, and Ayesha, respectively.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> [[Sylvester Stallone]] was also revealed to be in the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> with his role later revealed as [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]].<ref name=\"Stakar\"/> Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film.<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"/> On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since \"people were going to figure it out eventually [...] it was better that we took the reins in our own hands\" and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discover who Quill's father is to \"the story and the relationship that these characters have\".<ref name=\"GunnEgoReveal\"/> In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a [[post-credits scene]],<ref name=\"TimeFrame\"/> later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits.<ref name=\"5PostCreditScenes\"/><ref name=\"PostCreditsScenes\"/> Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found \"mortally wounded\" on the ship, but \"it ended up being a little confusing.\"<ref name=\"Gunn6thPostCredit\"/>\n\nIn November, Gillan revealed that the film was undergoing reshoots.<ref name=\"GillanReshoots\"/> That February, it was reported that the film had scored a perfect 100 in [[test screening]]s, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience \"from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'\".<ref name=\"PerfectTestScreening\"/> In March 2017, Gunn revealed that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] would appear in the film,<ref name=\"AdamCarollaPodcast\"/> and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing \"in a much bigger way [than the first film]. I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an [[iPhone]], and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles.\"<ref name=\"GunnGrootDancing\"/> [[Fred Raskin]] and [[Craig Wood (film editor)|Craig Wood]] returned from the first film to serve as editors.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"/> On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said [[Nathan Fillion]], who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]] in a sequence that would have shown several [[movie posters]] for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays [[Arkon]] and [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]].<ref name=\"Fillion\"/><ref name=\"FillionLeak\"/> Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so did not want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut.<ref name=\"Fillion2\"/> He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he \"was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically.\"<ref name=\"GunnNoClose\"/>\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = Planet Ego.jpg\n| width1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Apollonian gasket.svg\n| width2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Ego's planet (top) was designed to be \"highly geometric\" and made extensive use of [[fractal]]s, including [[Apollonian gasket]]s (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/>\n| footer_align = left\n| footer_background = \n}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Framestore]], [[Weta Digital]], Trixter, [[Method Studios]], [[Animal Logic]], [[Scanline VFX]], Lola VFX, Luma, and Cantina Creative.<ref name=\"GunnVFXVendors\"/> Previsualization was done by The Third Floor.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\"/> Framestore created 620 shots for the film, Weta Digital created 530, Method Studios more than 500, and Animal Logic created 147.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Framestore once again created Rocket and Groot,<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/><ref name=\"THRVFX\"/> with Method Studios, Weta Digital and Trixter also working on Rocket. Framestore rebuilt Rocket \"from the ground up\" for ''Vol. 2'', giving him an updated fur simulation, new facial shapes and phonemes, as well as a new eye rig, which came from a rig used for the character Gnarlack from ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Trixter's work on Rocket included when he sets off a trap for the Ravagers, additionally working on the sequence when Rocket, Yondu and Kraglin jump across space.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Other work from Framestore included creatures, spaceships,<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Ayesha's lair, the space chase, the ''Eclector'' scenes, and the adolescent Groot post-credit scene.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/>\n\nFramestore also created the film's opening sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Despite appearing as a single shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot's dancing in the sequence.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\"/> Framestore animation supervisor Arslan Elver noted that the majority of the opening sequence includes CGI and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot) consisting of actual photography.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/> As with the first film, Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' for consistency, \"this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon\". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore. Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having \"a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen\", but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler 2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company [[Exceptional Minds]] with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning them for their old textures and scratches.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\"/>\n\nThe destruction of the Ravager ship the ''Eclector'' was handled by Weta Digital.<ref name=\"WetaEclector\"/> Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for [[David Hasselhoff]] for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We tried morphing to a live-action Hoff\u2014but it did not hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version ... and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double ... we didn't want to go to the same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body ... so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide1\"/> Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the [[fractal art]] of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment.<ref name=\"THRVFX\"/><ref name=\"EmpireMar2017\"/> Gunn added that there are \"over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet,\" calling it \"the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it.\"<ref name=\"EmpireMar2017\"/>\n\nAnimal Logic and Method Studios also worked on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic focusing on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's \"not that button\" sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film to work on the story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts \"performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by\" Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/> Lola VFX worked on [[De-aging in film|de-aging]] Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), as \"he had a lot of the [facial] action\" the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, [[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]], since he had \"big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move[d] and crease[d] as he talk[ed]\", similar to Russell's.<ref name=\"FXGuide1\"/> [[Laura Haddock]], reprising her role from the first film of Meredith Quill in the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character.<ref name=\"58ThingsCommentary\"/> Luma worked on the Sovereign people and their world, and Adam Warlock's cocoon.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"/>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (soundtrack)}}\nBy August 2014, Gunn had \"some ideas listed, but nothing for sure\" in terms of songs to include in Quill's ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' mixtape,<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"/> for which he felt \"a little pressure\" due to the positive response to [[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|the first film's soundtrack]]. Gunn added, \"But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"<ref name=\"SoundtrackFeelings\"/> By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script,<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> calling ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\"<ref name=\"GunnSoundtrackDec2016\"/> [[Tyler Bates]] was confirmed to score the film by August 2015, returning from the first film.<ref name=\"Bates\"/> As with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the film.<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\"/><!--This information appears in the embedded video from Gunn at the 32:05 mark.--> Recording for the score occurred in January 2017 at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"GunnScoreJan\"/> ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2'', along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\"/><ref name=\"ScoreReleaseDate\"/> A cassette version of ''Awesome Mix Volume 2'' was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe-edition vinyl LP featuring both ''Awesome Mix Volume 2'' and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017.<ref name=\"CassetteRelease\"/>\n\n== Marketing ==\nIn June 2016, Marvel announced plans for an expanded merchandising program for the sequel, with Groot playing a central role.<ref name=\"GotG2Merch\"/> Gunn ensured the film's female characters received more representation in the merchandise than in the first.<ref name=\"GunnFemaleMerchandise\"/> Paul Gitter, senior vice president of licensing at [[Disney Consumer Products]], said they intended to build ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' into a tentpole franchise. Partners in the campaign included [[Hasbro]], [[Lego]], [[Funko]], [[LB Kids]],<ref name=\"GotG2Merch\"/> [[GEICO]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Go-Gurt]], [[Hanes]], [[Synchrony Bank]], [[Dairy Queen]], [[M&M's]], [[Screenvision]], [[Sprint Corporation]] and [[Wrigley Company]].<ref name=\"DeadlineMarketing\"/> Additionally, Marvel partnered with [[Doritos]] for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create a custom \"limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on [[Amazon.com]], with Doritos also hosting Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles where fans could sing the songs from ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom bags, concert tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\"<ref name=\"DoritosBag\"/>\n\nIn July 2016, Gunn, Pratt and other members of the cast attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\"/> showing footage and revealing additional character information.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\"/> On October 19, a \"sneak peek\" teaser was released ahead of the first full teaser trailer. Ethan Anderton of [[/Film]] felt the teaser was strong, despite not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot,<ref name=\"/FilmTeaser\"/> while ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Esther Zuckerman called it \"an immediate crowd-pleaser\".<ref name=\"AVClubTeaser\"/> According to media-measurement firm [[Comscore]] and its PreAct service, the teaser was the top trailer for the week it released, generating 108,000 new social media conversations.<ref name=\"VarietyTeaserTop\"/> In early December, before Gunn revealed the first teaser trailer at [[Comic Con Experience]] 2016,<ref name=\"TrailerCCXP\"/><ref name=\"TrailerACCDebut\"/> he said that finding scenes and moments to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted in hard choices, since \"people really go through every single little shot and try to figure out what the movie's about. And there's a lot of mysteries in ''Guardians 2''.\"<ref name=\"FirstTeaserDone\"/> Describing the teaser trailer, Jacob Hall of /Film noted that the trailer was able to succeed without giving too much away as it focused on character interactions rather than plot.<ref name=\"/FilmFirstTrailer\"/> The teaser trailer received 81 million views in 24 hours, becoming [[List of most viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|the second-most viewed teaser]] behind ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and largest Marvel Studios teaser ever. Additionally, Sweet's \"Fox on the Run\" reached number one on the [[iTunes]] Rock Chart after featuring in the teaser.<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\"/>\n\nA second trailer aired during [[Super Bowl LI]]. Germain Lussier for [[io9]] called it \"hilarious\",<ref name=\"SuperBowlio9\"/> while Anderton said it was \"one hell of a\" Super Bowl spot, \"one that probably overshadows the game itself for people like me... There's plenty of badass cosmic action, the humor we all love, a stellar soundtrack, and some great new footage from the sequel.\"<ref name=\"SuperBowl/Film\"/> The spot generated the most Twitter conversation volume during the game with 47,800 conversations, according to Comscore, who measured the volume of trailers that aired during the game from the time it aired through the end of the game. The film also topped a [[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] survey of fans' favorite film trailer during the Super Bowl.<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpotData\"/> An additional trailer debuted on February 28, 2017, on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. Haleigh Foutch at [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt the trailer added \"hype\" to the film, and was \"just an all-around wonderful trailer, lit up with the wacky humor and irreverent charm that made the first film such a hit, with an extra dose of visual splendor.\"<ref name=\"FebTrailerCollider\"/> Pratt and Saldana appeared at the [[2017 Kids' Choice Awards]], where they debuted an exclusive clip.<ref name=\"2017KidsChoiceAwards\"/> In mid-July, Marvel created a 1980s-inspired [[infomercial]] and an [[Toll-free telephone number|800 number]] to promote the film's home media release.<ref name=\"HomeMediaInfomercial\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiere 1.jpg|thumb|left|Premiere of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood, California]]\n''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' made its world premiere in Tokyo on April 10, 2017,<ref name=\"TokyoPremiere\"/> and its Hollywood premiere on April 19 at the [[Dolby Theatre]].<ref name=\"HollywoodPremiere\"/> The film began its international release on April 25, in Australia, New Zealand, and Italy,<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1\"/> alongside a total of 37 markets in its first weekend, with 176 [[IMAX]] screens in 35 of those markets.<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1New\"/> Its North American release on May 5 took place in 4,347 theaters, of which over 3,800 were in 3D,<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\"/> 388 in IMAX and [[IMAX 3D]],<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\"/><ref name=\"IMAX\"/> 588 premium large-format, and 194 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] locations.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\"/> The film's opening in China was in 400 IMAX theaters, the largest ever for the country.<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd2\"/> On May 4, 2017, 550 theaters in the United States had a special [[RealD]] ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' double feature event before preview screenings of ''Vol. 2''.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''{{'s}} action-packed plot, dazzling visuals, and irreverent humor add up to a sequel that's almost as fun\u2014if not quite as thrillingly fresh\u2014as its predecessor.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2|title=Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2|title=Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it a 93% overall positive score and a 77% \"definite recommend\".<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\"/>\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle... and just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing.\" He cautioned that \"this time you can sense just how hard [Gunn] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/> Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] described the film as a \"blast\" and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that \"''Vol. 2'' can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor...[but] the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy.<ref name=\"RSReview\"/> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}}s [[Richard Roeper]] also gave the film three stars, calling it not \"quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original\u2014but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.\" Roeper continued that \"even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat\", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with \"one of the best roles in the movie\".<ref name=\"ChicagoReview\"/> In his review for [[RogerEbert.com]], Brian Tallerico gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster\" that does not take itself seriously, avoiding \"many of the flaws of the first movie, and [doing] several things notably better. It's fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season.\"<ref name=\"RogerEbertReview\"/>\n\nAlso giving the film three out of four stars, Sara Stewart at the ''[[New York Post]]'' felt the film was overstuffed, but that Gunn's \"lighthearted approach makes this matter surprisingly little\" and \"at least it's stuffed with good cheer\". Praising the tone and 1980s references that gave the film a sense fun, Stewart called ''Vol. 2'' an \"antidote to somber superheroes\".<ref name=\"NYPostReview\"/> At ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Michael O'Sullivan gave the film four stars, praising it as being \"funnier, nuttier, and more touching\" than the first film. O'Sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on the original film rather than repeating it, and also noted the use of music as well as \"dazzling\" visuals throughout, describing the film as \"a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all.\"<ref name=\"WPReview\"/> Brian Lowry, writing for [[CNN.com]], criticized the middle portion of the film and its villain, but felt the film fared better than other Marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end, and \"good-natured energy\", saying it \"ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet\u2014rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.\"<ref name=\"CNNReview\"/> For ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Christopher Orr felt the film did not live up to the original, particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that Russell was \"badly miscast\", but the rest of the cast, soundtrack, and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review.<ref name=\"AtlanticReview\"/>\n\nAt ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Todd McCarthy]] said \"''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\"/> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders of the first ''Guardians'' to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [but it's] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\"<ref name=\"LAReview\"/> [[Manohla Dargis]] at ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Anthony Lane in his review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt once Ego was introduced, the film began to suffer from \"the curse of the backstory\" and that the \"point that the movie, which has been motoring along nicely, fuelled by silliness and pep, begins to splutter\" was when Ego's desire for larger meaning is revealed. Lane concluded, \"Let's hope that ''Vol. 3'' recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview\"/>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\"| 2017\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[2017 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi Movie]]\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{won}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref name=\"TeenChoice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/teen-choice-awards-winners-full-list-1029104/item/choice-female-artist-teen-choice-awards-releases-first-wave-2017-nominations-1015332|title=Teen Choice Awards: Complete Winners List|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=August 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6siSEgdnX?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/teen-choice-awards-winners-full-list-1029104/item/choice-female-artist-teen-choice-awards-releases-first-wave-2017-nominations-1015332|archivedate=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi-Movie Actor]]\n| [[Chris Pratt]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Choice Sci-Fi-Movie Actress]]\n| [[Zoe Saldana]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Choice MovieShip\n| Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Dragon Con#The Dragon Awards|Dragon Awards]]\n| Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liptak|first1=Andrew|title=The 2017 Dragon Awards are a far-ranging sci-fi and fantasy reading list|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/16094656/dragon-award-dragoncon-sci-fi-fantasy-books-sad-puppies|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 6, 2017|date=August 4, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Hollywood Film Awards]]\n| Sound Award\n| Dave Acord and [[Addison Teague]]\n| {{won}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref name=\"HollywoodAwards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/hollywood-film-awards-2017-complete-list-winners-sundays-ceremony-kate-winslet-jake-gyllenhaal-allison-janney-sam-rockwell-news/|title=Hollywood Film Awards 2017: Complete list of winners for Sunday's ceremony includes Kate Winslet, Jake Gyllenhaal, Allison Janney, Sam Rockwell|last=Beachum|first=Chris|date=November 3, 2017|publisher=Gold Derby|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|[[8th Hollywood Music in Media Awards|Hollywood Music in Media Awards]]\n| Soundtrack Album\n| ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref>{{cite web |last=Pond |first= Steve |title= Hollywood Music in Media Awards Announces Nominees in Film, TV, & Video Game Music |url=https://www.shootonline.com/spw/hollywood-music-media-awards-announces-nominees-film-tv-video-game-music |accessdate= October 26, 2017 |publisher= Shoot Online |date= October 26, 2017 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Original Song \u2013 Sci-fi, Fantasy, Horror Film\n| \"Guardian's Inferno\" for The Sneepers & [[David Hasselhoff]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Outstanding Music Supervision \u2013 Film\n| Dave Jordan\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[St. Louis Film Critics Association]]\n| Best Soundtrack\n|''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |<ref>{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=Annual StLFCA Awards| url=http://www.stlfilmcritics.org/awards/| accessdate=December 12, 2017| publisher=St. Louis Film Association|date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Washington D.C.

film, he also said he had ideas for a potential third film.<ref name=\"GotG3BasicStory\"/> Despite this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third ''Guardians'' film, saying it would depend on his feelings after making ''Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"/> In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films are \"still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say ''Guardians 3'' is [one film that's] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be.\"<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016GotG3\"/> In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film \"for sure. We're trying to figure it out,\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\"/> also adding, \"There are no specific plans for ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''. But we know unless something goes horribly\u2014which is always possible,<!-- \"possibly\" in the source is a misprint, as one can clearly hear Gunn saying \"possible\" in the interview itself. Using \"sic\" here is problematic as we are attributing the quotation to Gunn, and it implies he misspoke. --> you never know\u2014I think that Marvel would want to make another movie.\"<ref name=\"GunnMarch2017Yahoo\"/> He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\"/> The following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''.<ref name=\"GunnVol3Confirm\"/>\n\nHowever, in July 2018, Disney cut ties with Gunn following the resurfacing of old, controversial tweets from Gunn.<ref name=\"GunnFiredTHR\"/><ref name=\"GunnFiredDeadline\"/> Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Cooper, Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Gillan issued a statement in support of Gunn.<ref name=\"CastGunnSupport\"/> Pratt, Klementieff,<ref name=\"Vol32019Filming\"/> and Baut\u0456sta are expected to reprise their roles for a third film,<ref name=\"BautistaVol3\"/> though Bautista threatened to leave if Gunn's script was not used.<ref name=\"BautistaTwitter\"/> Filming had been expected to begin in 2019,<ref name=\"Vol32019Filming\"/> for an expected release in 2020.<ref name=\"GunnFiredTHR\"/><ref name=\"Vol32020Release\"/> In early August, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Disney was in no hurry to find a replacement director for Gunn, and was waiting for an A-list filmmaker to become available, even if it meant pushing the film's original February 2019 production date.<ref name=\"RehireUnlikely\"/> Later that month, production was put on hold.<ref name=\"OnHold\"/> In March 2019, Disney and Marvel Studios reversed course and reinstated Gunn as director. Filming of ''Vol. 3'' will commence once Gunn has completed his work for the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2020.<ref name=\"GunnRehired\"/><ref name=\"2020Production\"/> [[Chris Hemsworth]] has expressed interest in reprising his role as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] in the film, after the character joined the Guardians of the Galaxy at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"HemsworthVol3\"/> At the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige confirmed the sequel is in development.<ref name=\"SequelConfirmed\" />\n\nIn May 2019, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'' is due to start filming in 2020.<ref name=\"SequelFilmingStart\"/>\n<!--Back in 2017, [[James Gunn]] stated that

A couple weeks back I told you how the Marvel legal department advised against using Sneeper as an alien species in Guardians of the Galaxy because the word is \"similar to the word meaning 'clitoris' in Icelandic.\" Let it be known that I wasn't protesting this decision, I just thought it was funny, so I shared it. But the Marvel legal folks are sweet people and, after all of the online articles about me not being able to use the term Sneeper, they came back and told me that maybe it's not that big a deal after all: Sneeper is cleared for use. So keep an eye out for at least one Sneeper somewhere in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.}}</ref>\n\n<!--<ref name=\"DelToroReturn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/benicio-del-toro-returning-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/|title=Benicio Del Toro Returning For 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u2032|last=Giroux|first=Jack|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6c7wd4LJh?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/benicio-del-toro-returning-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/|archivedate=October 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=\"Klementieff\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/sand-castle-adds-comptons-neil-brown-jr-guardians-2-casts-pom-klementieff-in-mystery-role-mantis-1201597456/ |title='Compton's Neil Brown Jr. Signs on For 'Sand Castle'; Pom Klementieff Joins 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' |last=Lincoln |first=Ross |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=October 29, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ceQlwLYa?url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/sand-castle-adds-comptons-neil-brown-jr-guardians-2-casts-pom-klementieff-in-mystery-role-mantis-1201597456/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McConaughey\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pom-klementieff-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-1201629203/ |title='Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2': Newcomer Pom Klementieff Cast in Mystery Role |last=Kroll |first=Justin |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 28, 2015 |accessdate=October 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cd4eS3rd?url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/pom-klementieff-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-1201629203/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BautistaScript\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2015/11/04/dave-bautista-says-james-gunn-making-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol/ |title=Dave Bautista Says James Gunn Making Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Different |last=Siegel |first=Lucas |publisher=ComicBook.com |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cosZKjvL?url=http://comicbook.com/2015/11/04/dave-bautista-says-james-gunn-making-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol/ |archivedate=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GillanNov2015\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/gillan-says-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-fleshes-out-gamora-nebulas-relationship |title=Gillan Says \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" Fleshes Out Gamora & Nebula's Relationship |last=Huver |first=Scott |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 17, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d7NhfrI8?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/gillan-says-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-fleshes-out-gamora-nebulas-relationship |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GunnDec2015\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-gunn-pushes-for-more-gamora-merchandise-talks-guardians-vol-2 |title=James Gunn Pushes For More Gamora Merchandise, Talks \"Guardians Vol 2\" |last=Damore |first=Meagan |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dXMe274f?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/james-gunn-pushes-for-more-gamora-merchandise-talks-guardians-vol-2 |archivedate=December 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/kurt-russell-guardians-galaxy-chris-pratt-father-1201662266/ |title=Kurt Russell Eyed to Play Chris Pratt's Father in 'Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2' |last=Kroll |first=Justin |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 15, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6do54mrkY?url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/kurt-russell-guardians-galaxy-chris-pratt-father-1201662266/ |archivedate=December 16, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\">{{cite magazine|last=Hewitt|first=Chris|title=Set Phase 3 To Stun|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=United Kingdom|page=21|date=February 2016|quote=Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 (April 28, 2017)...
