Lyrics include themes of patriotism, Nepali virtues, unity, love and nationalism. There is a lot of variety in the music of 1974&nbsp;AD. They have successfully tried various genres of music. Their songs, like \"Nepali,\" \"Sambodhan,\" \"Pahilo Junima,\" \"Parelima,\" \"Samjhi Baschu\" and \"Chudaina Timro Mayale\" and others, were some of the biggest hits in Nepalese music. The song \"Nepali Ho\" from their highest selling album Satabdi has been received as the most patriotic commercial song till date.\n\n== Formation (1994) ==\n\nThe group was formed during the 90s by a group of teachers from Gyanodaya School in [[Lalitpur, Nepal]]. The founding members were guitarist [[Phiroj Shyangden (Nepali Musician)|Phiroj Shyangden]], bassist Nirakar Yakthumba and drummer Bhanu A. During the early days the band played various genres for music like hard rock, heavy metal, rock and blues. Drummer Bhanu A was influenced by blues music. When they played cover tunes he sang Gary Moore numbers like \"Walking by Myself\". They played several gigs in and around Kathmandu where they covered numbers by Bryan Adams, Deep Purple and other rock groups. He is also a good guitarist and his bluesy rock style has inspired many guitarists in Nepal. His style has the flavor of guitarists like Gary Moore, Ritchie Blackmore and Eddie Van Halen. They mainly performed their own compositions. The hit tune is \"Mayaluleh\" from their debut album \"Time Out\", established 1974 AD as a household name. During this time, future members [[Adrian Pradhan]] and Sanjay Shreshta were involved with their own bands. Adrian used to be in a hard rock band from [[Kalimpong]] called \"The Flame\".\n\n\"The Flame\" held their first concert in Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu during the winter of 1994. They were basically a cover band doing songs from Iron Maiden, Metallica, Extreme, and other rock acts. Adrian Pradhan played rhythm guitar and performed vocals. The influence of early heavy metal can be heard in Adrian's singing style. Later during the late 90s Adrian joined 1974&nbsp;AD as their drummer/vocalist after former drummer Bhanu A went on hiatus. Percussionist Sanjay Shrestha, who used to play the drums for the St Xavier's school band, was involved with Nepali fusion rock act Shristi.\n\nFlute maestro Manoj Singh would soon join 1974&nbsp;AD and enjoy the popularity of the highly successful band and also contribute to the diversity of sound in the band.  During the late 90s local guitar enthusiast Manoj K.C from Dhobighat, Lalitpur joined 1974&nbsp;AD, completing the lineup.  Together they would form a solid act and go on to conquer the hearts of millions of die-hard fans.\n\n== Fame and fortune ==\n\nThe band was very popular in the Kathmandu and Lalitpur rock scene in mid 90s even before they started churning out big hits like \"Mayalule\" and other tunes. But the release of their debut album established them as a household name in Nepali music. Their compositions which includes \nlyrics on patriotism, self pride as a Nepali and love and unity amongst Nepali people are big hits in Nepali pop culture. They have come up with songs that has helped the nation unite and \nexpress the mutual feelings at times of big changes in country as in the form of political and other big events. The songs can be melodic but at the same time very dark with the lyrics and message it carries. The music covers various genres like heavy metal, hard rock, blues, reggae and funk/soul.\n\n== Post Phiroj 1974AD (2008\u20132012) ==\n\nWhile Manose Singh continues to contribute to the bands newer compositions, given his other musical commitment, Phiroj Shyangden has now exited the band for personal reasons.

Their new album 8:18 (aath:athara) has been received well by the audience. Numbers like Timi Bina, Bardaan and Rain Song from the album emerged to become winner.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

The following tables include general and technical information on notable [[version control]] and [[software configuration management]] (SCM) [[software]].  For SCM software not suitable for [[source code]], see [[Comparison of open-source configuration-management software]].\n\n== General information ==\n<!--Entries in these lists should be \"notable\" with a sourced stand-alone article (see also WP:CSC and WP:GNG).-->\n'''Table explanation'''\n*''Repository model'' describes the relationship between various copies of the [[source code repository]]. In a [[client\u2013server model]], users access a master repository via a [[Client (computing)|client]]; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a [[Distributed version control|distributed]] model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.\n*''Concurrency model'' describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing nonsensical data in the repository. In a ''lock'' model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an [[readers\u2013writer lock|exclusive lock]] on the file from the master repository. In a ''merge'' model, users may freely edit files, but are informed of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may [[merge (version control)|merge changes]] on both sides, or let the user decide when [[edit conflict|conflicts]] arise. Distributed version control systems usually use a merge concurrency model.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Maintainer\n!

If the same file has been renamed on both branches then there is a rename conflict that the user must resolve.\n* ''[[Symbolic link]]s'': describes whether a system allows revision control of symbolic links as with regular files.  Versioning symbolic links is considered by some people a feature and some people a security breach (e.g., a symbolic link to /etc/passwd). Symbolic links are only supported on select platforms, depending on the software.\n* ''Pre-/post-event hooks'': indicates the capability to trigger commands before or after an action, such as a commit, takes place.\n* ''[[digital signature|Signed]] revisions'': refers to integrated digital signing of revisions, in a format such as [[OpenPGP]].\n* ''Merge tracking'': describes whether a system remembers what changes have been merged between which branches and only merges the changes that are missing when merging one branch into another.\n* ''[[End of line]] conversions'': describes whether a system can adapt the end of line characters for text files such that they match the end of line style for the operating system under which it is used.  The granularity of control varies.

In a [[client\u2013server model]], users access a master repository via a [[Client (computing)|client]]; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a [[Distributed version control|distributed]] model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.\n*''Concurrency model'' describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing nonsensical data in the repository. In a ''lock'' model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an [[readers\u2013writer lock|exclusive lock]] on the file from the master repository. In a ''merge'' model, users may freely edit files, but are informed of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may [[merge (version control)|merge changes]] on both sides, or let the user decide when [[edit conflict|conflicts]] arise. Distributed version control systems usually use a merge concurrency model.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Maintainer\n!

A ''snapshot'' indicates that a committed file(s) is stored in its entirety\u2014usually compressed.  A ''[[changeset]]'', in this context, indicates that a committed file(s) is stored in the form of a difference between either the previous version or the next.\n* ''Scope of change'': Describes whether changes are recorded for individual ''files'' or for entire directory ''trees''.\n* ''<span id=\"Revision IDs\">Revision IDs</span>'': are used internally to identify specific versions of files in the repository. Systems may use ''[[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]]'' identifiers, content hashes of revisions, or filenames with sequential version numbers (''namespace'').  With Integrated Difference, revisions are based on the Changesets themselves, which can describe changes to more than one file.\n* ''Network protocols'': lists the [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] used for [[data synchronization|synchronization of changes]].\n* ''Source code size'': Gives the size of the source code in megabytes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n!

If the same file has been renamed on both branches then there is a rename conflict that the user must resolve.\n* ''[[Symbolic link]]s'': describes whether a system allows revision control of symbolic links as with regular files.  Versioning symbolic links is considered by some people a feature and some people a security breach (e.g., a symbolic link to /etc/passwd). Symbolic links are only supported on select platforms, depending on the software.\n* ''Pre-/post-event hooks'': indicates the capability to trigger commands before or after an action, such as a commit, takes place.\n* ''[[digital signature|Signed]] revisions'': refers to integrated digital signing of revisions, in a format such as [[OpenPGP]].\n* ''Merge tracking'': describes whether a system remembers what changes have been merged between which branches and only merges the changes that are missing when merging one branch into another.\n* ''[[End of line]] conversions'': describes whether a system can adapt the end of line characters for text files such that they match the end of line style for the operating system under which it is used.  The granularity of control varies.  Subversion, for example, can be configured to handle EOLs differently according to the file type, whereas Perforce converts all text files according to a single, per-client setting.\n* ''[[revision tag|Tags]]'': indicates if meaningful names can be given to specific revisions, regardless of whether these names are called tags or labels.\n* ''International support'': indicates if the software has support for multiple language environments and operating system\n* ''Unicode filename support'': indicates if the software has support for interoperations under [[file system]]s using different [[character encoding]]s.\n* ''Supports large repos'': Can the system handle repositories of around a gigabyte or larger effectively?\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n!

The reason for partial support in the table is because Subversion's emulation of tags in this manner does not meet the requirement that the tag name can be used in place of any revision identifier wherever the user may be required to enter one.
