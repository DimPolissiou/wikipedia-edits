War was common during Planck's early years  and among his earliest memories was the marching of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops into Kiel during the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1867 the family moved to [[Munich]], and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] school, where he came under the tutelage of Hermann M\u00fcller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him [[astronomy]] and [[mechanics]] as well as mathematics. It was from M\u00fcller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Max Planck''</ref> This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.\n\nPlanck was gifted when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. However, instead of music he chose to study [[physics]].\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|left|upright|Planck as a young man, 1878]]\n\nThe Munich physics professor [[Philipp von Jolly]] advised Planck against going into physics, saying, \"in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lightman|first=Alan P.|title=The discoveries: great breakthroughs in twentieth-century science, including the original papers|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf Canada|location=Toronto|year=2005|isbn=0-676-97789-8|page=8}}</ref> Planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the [[University of Munich]]. Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the [[diffusion]] of [[hydrogen]] through heated [[platinum]], but transferred to [[theoretical physics]].\n\nIn 1877 he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin for a year of study with physicists [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and mathematician [[Karl Weierstrass]]. He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius's]] writings, which led him to choose [[thermodynamics]] as his field.\n\nIn October 1878 Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation, ''\u00dcber den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie'' (''On the second law of thermodynamics''). He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich.\n\nBy the year 1880, Planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in Europe. The first was a doctorate degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and theory of thermodynamics.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then presented his thesis called ''Gleichgewichtszust\u00e4nde isotroper K\u00f6rper in verschiedenen Temperaturen'' (''Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures''), which earned him a [[habilitation]].\n\n===Academic career===\nWith the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid [[Privatdozent]] (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of [[theory of heat|heat theory]] and discovered one after another the same [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]]al formalism as [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] without realizing it. Clausius's ideas on [[entropy]] occupied a central role in his work.\n\nIn April 1885, the [[University of Kiel]] appointed Planck as associate professor of [[theoretical physics]]. Further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in [[physical chemistry]], followed. He published his ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'' in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Vorlesungen \u00fcber Thermodynamik|year=1897|publisher=Verlag Von Veit & Company|location=Leipzig|url=http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/31564|accessdate=27 June 2012}} English translation: {{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Treatise on Thermodynamics|year=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich|quote=Treatise on Thermodynamics.|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> He proposed a thermodynamic basis for [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]].\n\nIn 1889 he was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Berlin]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html |title=Max Planck \u2013 Biographical |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Prize Organisation |access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> \u2013 presumably thanks to Helmholtz's intercession \u2013 and by 1892 became a full professor.

During 1909, as a University of Berlin professor, he was invited to become the Ernest Kempton Adams Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].

They had four children: Karl (1888\u20131916), the twins Emma (1889\u20131919) and Grete (1889\u20131917), and [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] (1893\u20131945).\n\nAfter the apartment in Berlin, the Planck family lived in a villa in Berlin-Grunewald, Wangenheimstrasse 21. Several other professors from [[University of Berlin]] lived nearby, among them theologian [[Adolf von Harnack]], who became a close friend of Planck. Soon the Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]] were frequent visitors. The tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]].\n\nAfter several happy years, in July 1909 Marie Planck died, possibly from [[tuberculosis]]. In March 1911 Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin (1882\u20131948); in December his fifth child Hermann was born.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] Planck's second son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his oldest son Karl was killed in action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. Her sister died the same way two years later, after having married Grete's widower. Both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. Planck endured these losses stoically.\n\nIn January 1945, [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]], to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the [[Nazi]] [[People's Court (German)|Volksgerichtshof]] because of his participation in the [[July 20 plot|failed attempt to assassinate Hitler]] in July 1944. Erwin was executed on 23 January 1945.<ref>{{cite book|author1=J\u00fcrgen Heideking|author2=Christof Mauch|title=American Intelligence and the German Resistance to Hitler: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoTWkzhf2uUC&pg=PA361|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=5 October 1998|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-3636-7|pages=361\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Professor at Berlin University===\nAs a professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Berlin]], Planck joined the local Physical Society. He later wrote about this time: \"In those days I was essentially the only theoretical physicist there, whence things were not so easy for me, because I started mentioning entropy, but this was not quite fashionable, since it was regarded as a mathematical spook\".<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1        = Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker\n| last2        = Elektrotechnischer Verein (Berlin, Germany)\n| year         = 1948\n| journal      = ETZ: Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift\n| title        = ETZ: Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift: Ausg.

The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: \"how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the [[frequency]] of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?\". The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values. [[Wilhelm Wien]] proposed [[Wien approximation|Wien's law]], which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]], another approach to the problem, agreed with experimental results at low frequencies, but created what was later known as the \"[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]\" at high frequencies. However, contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for Planck.<ref name=\"Kragh\">For a solid approach to the complexity of Planck's intellectual motivations for the quantum, for his reluctant acceptance of its implications, see Helge Kragh, \n[https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary], ''Physics World''. December 2000.</ref>\n\nPlanck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what Planck called the \"principle of elementary disorder\", which allowed him to derive Wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred-to as the [[Wien\u2013Planck law]]. Soon it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck's frustration. Planck revised his approach, deriving the first version of the famous [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|Planck black-body radiation law]], which described the experimentally observed black-body spectrum well. It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901. This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use [[statistical mechanics]], to which he held an aversion. In November 1900, Planck revised this first approach, relying on [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. As Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, \"an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics.\"<ref name=\"Kragh\"/>\n\nThe central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the [[Planck postulate]], that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:\n\n:<math>E = h\\nu</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]], also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and {{math|''\u03bd''}} is the frequency of the radiation. Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by {{math|''h\u03bd''}} and not simply by {{math|''\u03bd''}}. Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency {{math|''\u03bd''}} will have its own specific and unique energy. The total energy at that frequency is then equal to {{math|''h\u03bd''}} multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.\n\n[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]\nAt first Planck considered that quantisation was only \"a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...\"; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with [[classical physics]], is regarded as the birth of [[quantum physics]] and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918 (he actually received the award in 1919).<ref>Kragh, Helge (1 December 2000), Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary, PhysicsWorld.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. \"My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble.\" Even several years later, other physicists like [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]], [[James Jeans|Jeans]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] set Planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. \"I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness \u2013 he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as [[Hegel]] was for philosophy. So much the worse for the facts if they don't fit.\"<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA8 page 8]</ref>\n\n[[Max Born]] wrote about Planck: \"He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics.\"<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n===Einstein and the theory of relativity===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Max-Planck-und-Albert-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Max Planck presents [[Albert Einstein]] with the Max-Planck medal, Berlin 28 June 1929]] -->\nIn 1905, the three epochal papers by [[Albert Einstein]] were published in the journal ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''. Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the [[special theory of relativity]]. Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For example, he recast the theory in terms of classical [[Action (physics)|action]].<ref>''Einstein and the Quantum'', A.Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, chapter 9, ''Tripping the light heuristic'', 2013.</ref>\n\nEinstein's hypothesis of light ''quanta'' ([[photons]]), based on [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|Heinrich Hertz's]] 1887 discovery (and further investigation by [[Philipp Lenard#Photoelectric investigations|Philipp Lenard]]) of the [[photoelectric effect]], was initially rejected by Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electrodynamics]]. \"The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when [[Christiaan Huygens]] dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of [[Isaac Newton]] ...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atoms and Photons and Quanta, Oh My!: Ask the physicist about atomic, nuclear, and quantum physics|last=Baker|first=F.

Planck and [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]], seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First [[Solvay Conference]] (Brussels 1911). At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.\n\nMeanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University, whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.\n\n===First World War===\nAt the onset of the [[First World War]] Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, \"Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble.\"<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA72 page 72]</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Quantum mechanics at the crossroads: new perspectives from history, philosophy and physics\n|first1=James\n|last1=Evans\n|first2=Alan S.\n|last2=Thorndike\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-3-540-32663-2\n|page=31\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC&pg=PA31 Extract of page 31]\n</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Planck refrained from the extremes of nationalism. In 1915, at a time when Italy was about to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where Planck was one of four permanent presidents.\n\nPlanck also signed the infamous \"[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals]]\", a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, only being spared thanks to his [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] citizenship). However, in 1915, after several meetings with Dutch physicist, [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]], he revoked parts of the Manifesto. In 1916, he signed a declaration against German [[wikt:annexationism|annexationism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Post-war and the Weimar Republic===\nIn the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority of German physics, issued the slogan \"persevere and continue working\" to his colleagues.\n\nIn October 1920, he and [[Fritz Haber]] established the ''[[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]]'' (Emergency Organization of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.\n\nPlanck also held leading positions at Berlin University, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the German Physical Society and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (which became the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948). During this time economic conditions in Germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research. In 1926, Planck became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002335 |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858\u20131947) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, Planck became a member of the Deutsche Volks-Partei ([[German People's Party]]), the party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Gustav Stresemann]], which aspired to liberal aims for domestic policy and rather revisionistic aims for politics around the world.\n\nPlanck disagreed with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] and later expressed the view that the Nazi dictatorship resulted from \"the ascent of the rule of the crowds\".<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The demon and the quantum: from the pythagorean mystics to Maxwell's demon and quantum mystery\n|first1=Robert J.\n|last1=Scully\n|first2=Marlan O.\n|last2=Scully\n|publisher=Wiley-VCH\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-3-527-40688-3\n|page=90\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQHswDNUbvMC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQHswDNUbvMC&pg=PA90 Chapter 7, p 90]\n</ref>\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n[[File:Nernst, Einstein, Planck, Millikan, Laue in 1931.jpg|thumb|330px|From left to right: [[Walther Nernst|W.

Millikan]] and [[Max von Laue|von Laue]] at a dinner given by von Laue in Berlin on 11 November 1931]]\nAt the end of the 1920s [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] had worked out the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected by Planck, and by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Max von Laue|Laue]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as well. Planck expected that [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] would soon render quantum theory\u2014his own child\u2014unnecessary. This was not to be the case, however. Further work only cemented quantum theory, even against his and Einstein's philosophical revulsions. Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views in his younger years: \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"<ref>Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.</ref>\n\n===Nazi dictatorship and the Second World War===\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74. He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from [[Nazi Germany]]. Again he tried to \"persevere and continue working\" and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist [[Hermann Kranold]], to emigrate to [[London]] after his arrest.<ref name=\"IJ\">{{cite web|title=Johanna Kranold Stein|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theithacajournal/obituary.aspx?n=johanna-kranold-stein&pid=87920213|website=Ithaca Journal|publisher=Legacy.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.\n\n[[Otto Hahn]] asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, \"If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others.\"<ref>In a slightly different translation, Hahn remembers Planck saying: \"If you bring together 30 such men today, then tomorrow 150 will come to denounce them because they want to take their places.\" This translated quote is found in: Heilbron, 2000, p. 150. Heilbron, at the end of the paragraph, on p. 151, cites the following references to Hahn\u2019s writings: Otto Hahn ''Einige pers\u00f6nliche Erinnerungen an Max Planck'' MPG, ''Mitteilungen'' (1957) p. 244, and Otto Hahn ''My Life'' (Herder and Herder, 1970) p. 140.</ref> Under Planck's leadership, the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, except concerning [[Fritz Haber]]. Planck tried to discuss the issue with [[Adolf Hitler]] but was unsuccessful. In the following year, 1934, Haber died in exile.\n\nOne year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for Haber. He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.\n\nAs the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, [[Johannes Stark]], prominent exponent of [[Deutsche Physik]] (\"German Physics\", also called \"Aryan Physics\") attacked Planck, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], calling them \"white Jews\". The \"Hauptamt Wissenschaft\" (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was \"1/16 Jewish\", but Planck himself denied it.<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA191 page 191]</ref>\n\n[[File:Stadtfriedhof G\u00f6ttingen Max Planck Familie.jpg|thumb|Max Planck's grave in G\u00f6ttingen]]\nIn 1938, Planck celebrated his 80th birthday. The DPG held a celebration, during which the Max-Planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the DPG in 1928) was awarded to French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]]. At the end of 1938, the Prussian Academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by Nazis (''[[Gleichschaltung]]''). Planck protested by resigning his presidency. He continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on Religion and Science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the [[Alps]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the increasing number of Allied bombing missions against Berlin forced Planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. In 1942, he wrote: \"In me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise.\" In February 1944, his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. His rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the Allied armies from both sides.\n\nIn 1944, Planck's son [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] following the attempted assassination of Hitler in the [[20 July plot]]. He was tried and sentenced to death by the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] in October 1944. Erwin was hanged at Berlin's [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in January 1945. The death of his son destroyed much of Planck's will to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck |accessdate=2010-06-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512151051/http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |archivedate=12 May 2008 }}</ref> After the end of the war Planck, his second wife, and his son by her were brought to a relative in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], where Planck died on 4 October 1947.

Retrieved on 2011-07-05.</ref>\nIn a lecture in 1937 entitled \"Religion und Naturwissenschaft\" (Religion and Natural Science) he suggested the importance of these symbols and rituals related directly with a believer's ability to worship God, but that one must be mindful that the symbols provide an imperfect illustration of divinity. He criticized atheism for being focused on the derision of such symbols, while at the same time warned of the over-estimation of the importance of such symbols by believers.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Max_Planck.aspx The Life Max Planck]. encyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-07.</ref>\n\nPlanck was tolerant and favorable to all religions. Although he remained in the Lutheran Church, he did not promote Christian or Biblical views. He believed \"the faith in miracles must yield, step by step, before the steady and firm advance of the facts of science, and its total defeat is undoubtedly a matter of time.\" <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Max_Planck.html|title=The religion of Max Planck, physicist|website=www.adherents.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1937 lecture \"Religion and Naturwissenschaft,\" Planck expressed the view that God is everywhere present, and held that \"the holiness of the unintelligible Godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols.\" Atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. He was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (though not necessarily a personal one). Both science and religion wage a \"tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition\" with the goal \"toward God!\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nPlanck said in 1944, \"As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit (orig. geist). This spirit is the matrix of all matter.\"<ref>Das Wesen der Materie [The Nature of Matter], speech at Florence, Italy (1944) (from Archiv zur Geschichte der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Abt. Va, Rep. 11 Planck, Nr. 1797)</ref>\n\nPlanck regarded the scientist as a man of imagination and Christian faith. He said: \"Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists He is at the end of all considerations\u2026 To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view\".<ref>Religion and Natural Science (Lecture Given 1937) Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans. F. Gaynor (New York, 1949), pp. 184 (from http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck)</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Planck wrote, \"...'to believe' means 'to recognize as a truth,' and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and simple, without doubt or criticism. The belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish completely.\"<ref>Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers</ref>\n\nLater in life, Planck's views on God were that of a [[deist]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dilemmas of an Upright Man: Max Planck and the Fortunes of German Science|year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674004399|author=J.

War was common during Planck's early years  and among his earliest memories was the marching of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] troops into Kiel during the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1867 the family moved to [[Munich]], and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] school, where he came under the tutelage of Hermann M\u00fcller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him [[astronomy]] and [[mechanics]] as well as mathematics. It was from M\u00fcller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Max Planck''</ref> This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.\n\nPlanck was gifted when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. However, instead of music he chose to study [[physics]].\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|left|upright|Planck as a young man, 1878]]\n\nThe Munich physics professor [[Philipp von Jolly]] advised Planck against going into physics, saying, \"in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lightman|first=Alan P.|title=The discoveries: great breakthroughs in twentieth-century science, including the original papers|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf Canada|location=Toronto|year=2005|isbn=0-676-97789-8|page=8}}</ref> Planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the [[University of Munich]]. Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the [[diffusion]] of [[hydrogen]] through heated [[platinum]], but transferred to [[theoretical physics]].\n\nIn 1877 he went to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin for a year of study with physicists [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and mathematician [[Karl Weierstrass]]. He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius's]] writings, which led him to choose [[thermodynamics]] as his field.\n\nIn October 1878 Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation, ''\u00dcber den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie'' (''On the second law of thermodynamics''). He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich.\n\nBy the year 1880, Planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in Europe. The first was a doctorate degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and theory of thermodynamics.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then presented his thesis called ''Gleichgewichtszust\u00e4nde isotroper K\u00f6rper in verschiedenen Temperaturen'' (''Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures''), which earned him a [[habilitation]].\n\n===Academic career===\nWith the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid [[Privatdozent]] (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of [[theory of heat|heat theory]] and discovered one after another the same [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]]al formalism as [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] without realizing it. Clausius's ideas on [[entropy]] occupied a central role in his work.\n\nIn April of 1885, the [[University of Kiel]] appointed Planck as associate professor of [[theoretical physics]]. Further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in [[physical chemistry]], followed. He published his ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'' in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Vorlesungen \u00fcber Thermodynamik|year=1897|publisher=Verlag Von Veit & Company|location=Leipzig|url=http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/31564|accessdate=27 June 2012}} English translation: {{cite book|last=Planck|first=Max|title=Treatise on Thermodynamics|year=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich|quote=Treatise on Thermodynamics.|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> He proposed a thermodynamic basis for [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]].\n\nIn 1889 he was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Berlin]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html |title=Max Planck - Biographical |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Prize Organisation |access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> \u2013 presumably thanks to Helmholtz's intercession \u2013 and by 1892 became a full professor.

They had four children: Karl (1888\u20131916), the twins Emma (1889\u20131919) and Grete (1889\u20131917), and [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] (1893\u20131945).\n\nAfter the apartment in Berlin, the Planck family lived in a villa in Berlin-Grunewald, Wangenheimstrasse 21. Several other professors from [[University of Berlin]] lived nearby, among them theologian [[Adolf von Harnack]], who became a close friend of Planck. Soon the Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]] were frequent visitors. The tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]].\n\nAfter several happy years, in July 1909 Marie Planck died, possibly from [[tuberculosis]]. In March 1911 Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin (1882\u20131948); in December his fifth child Hermann was born.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] Planck's second son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his oldest son Karl was killed in action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. Her sister died the same way two years later, after having married Grete's widower. Both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. Planck endured these losses stoically.\n\nIn January 1945, [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]], to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the [[Nazi]] [[People's Court (German)|Volksgerichtshof]] because of his participation in the [[July 20 plot|failed attempt to assassinate Hitler]] in July 1944.

The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: \"how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the [[frequency]] of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?\". The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values. [[Wilhelm Wien]] proposed [[Wien approximation|Wien's law]], which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]], another approach to the problem, agreed with experimental results at low frequencies, but created what was later known as the \"[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]\" at high frequencies. However, contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for Planck.<ref name=\"Kragh\">For a solid approach to the complexity of Planck's intellectual motivations for the quantum, for his reluctant acceptance of its implications, see Helge Kragh, \n[https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/ Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary], ''Physics World''. December 2000.</ref>\n\nPlanck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what Planck called the \"principle of elementary disorder\", which allowed him to derive Wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred-to as the [[Wien\u2013Planck law]]. Soon it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck's frustration. Planck revised his approach, deriving the first version of the famous [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|Planck black-body radiation law]], which described the experimentally observed black-body spectrum well. It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901. This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use [[statistical mechanics]], to which he held an aversion. In November 1900, Planck revised this first approach, relying on [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. As Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, \"an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics.\"<ref name=\"Kragh\"/>\n\nThe central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the [[Planck postulate]], that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:\n\n:<math>E = h\\nu</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]], also known as Planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and {{math|''\u03bd''}} is the frequency of the radiation. Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by {{math|''h\u03bd''}} and not simply by {{math|''\u03bd''}}. Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency {{math|''\u03bd''}} will have its own specific and unique energy. The total energy at that frequency is then equal to {{math|''h\u03bd''}} multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.\n\n[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]\nAt first Planck considered that quantisation was only \"a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...\"; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with [[classical physics]], is regarded as the birth of [[quantum physics]] and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck's career ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918 (he actually received the award in 1919).<ref>Kragh, Helge (1 December 2000), Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary, PhysicsWorld.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. \"My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble.\" Even several years later, other physicists like [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]], [[James Jeans|Jeans]], and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] set Planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. \"I am unable to understand Jeans' stubbornness \u2013 he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as [[Hegel]] was for philosophy. So much the worse for the facts if they don't fit.\"<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA8 page 8]</ref>\n\n[[Max Born]] wrote about Planck: \"He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics.\"<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n===Einstein and the theory of relativity===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Max-Planck-und-Albert-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Max Planck presents [[Albert Einstein]] with the Max-Planck medal, Berlin 28 June 1929]] -->\nIn 1905, the three epochal papers by [[Albert Einstein]] were published in the journal ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''. Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the [[special theory of relativity]]. Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For example, he recast the theory in terms of classical [[Action (physics)|action]].<ref>''Einstein and the Quantum'', A.Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, chapter 9, ''Tripping the light heuristic'', 2013.</ref>\n\nEinstein's hypothesis of light ''quanta'' ([[photons]]), based on [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|Heinrich Hertz's]] 1887 discovery (and further investigation by [[Philipp Lenard#Photoelectric investigations|Philipp Lenard]]) of the [[photoelectric effect]], was initially rejected by Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electrodynamics]]. \"The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when [[Christiaan Huygens]] dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of [[Isaac Newton]] ...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atoms and Photons and Quanta, Oh My!: Ask the physicist about atomic, nuclear, and quantum physics|last=Baker|first=F. Todd|publisher=Morgan & Claypool Publishers|date=1 Jun 2015|isbn=978-1627059404|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of [[specific heat]] at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which defies explanation by classical physics. Planck and [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]], seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First [[Solvay Conference]] (Brussels 1911). At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.\n\nMeanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University, whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.\n\n===First World War===\nAt the onset of the [[First World War]] Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, \"Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble.\"<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA72 page 72]</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Quantum mechanics at the crossroads: new perspectives from history, philosophy and physics\n|first1=James\n|last1=Evans\n|first2=Alan S.\n|last2=Thorndike\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-3-540-32663-2\n|page=31\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FOuMYHcqIC&pg=PA31 Extract of page 31]\n</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Planck refrained from the extremes of nationalism. In 1915, at a time when Italy was about to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where Planck was one of four permanent presidents.\n\nPlanck also signed the infamous \"[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals]]\", a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, only being spared thanks to his [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] citizenship). However, in 1915, after several meetings with Dutch physicist, [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]], he revoked parts of the Manifesto. In 1916, he signed a declaration against German [[wikt:annexationism|annexationism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Post-war and the Weimar Republic===\nIn the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority of German physics, issued the slogan \"persevere and continue working\" to his colleagues.\n\nIn October 1920, he and [[Fritz Haber]] established the ''[[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]]'' (Emergency Organization of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.\n\nPlanck also held leading positions at Berlin University, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the German Physical Society and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (which became the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948). During this time economic conditions in Germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research. In 1926, Planck became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002335 |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858\u20131947) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, Planck became a member of the Deutsche Volks-Partei ([[German People's Party]]), the party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Gustav Stresemann]], which aspired to liberal aims for domestic policy and rather revisionistic aims for politics around the world.\n\nPlanck disagreed with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] and later expressed the view that the Nazi dictatorship resulted from \"the ascent of the rule of the crowds\".<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The demon and the quantum: from the pythagorean mystics to Maxwell's demon and quantum mystery\n|first1=Robert J.\n|last1=Scully\n|first2=Marlan O.\n|last2=Scully\n|publisher=Wiley-VCH\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-3-527-40688-3\n|page=90\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQHswDNUbvMC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQHswDNUbvMC&pg=PA90 Chapter 7, p 90]\n</ref>\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n[[File:Nernst, Einstein, Planck, Millikan, Laue in 1931.jpg|thumb|330px|From left to right: [[Walther Nernst|W.

Millikan]] and [[Max von Laue|von Laue]] at a dinner given by von Laue in Berlin on 11 November 1931]]\nAt the end of the 1920s [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] had worked out the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected by Planck, and by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Max von Laue|Laue]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as well. Planck expected that [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]] would soon render quantum theory\u2014his own child\u2014unnecessary. This was not to be the case, however. Further work only cemented quantum theory, even against his and Einstein's philosophical revulsions. Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views in his younger years: \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"<ref>Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.</ref>\n\n===Nazi dictatorship and the Second World War===\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74. He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from [[Nazi Germany]]. Again he tried to \"persevere and continue working\" and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist [[Hermann Kranold]], to emigrate to [[London]] after his arrest.<ref name=\"IJ\">{{cite web|title=Johanna Kranold Stein|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theithacajournal/obituary.aspx?n=johanna-kranold-stein&pid=87920213|website=Ithaca Journal|publisher=Legacy.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref> He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.\n\n[[Otto Hahn]] asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, \"If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others.\"<ref>In a slightly different translation, Hahn remembers Planck saying: \"If you bring together 30 such men today, then tomorrow 150 will come to denounce them because they want to take their places.\" This translated quote is found in: Heilbron, 2000, p. 150. Heilbron, at the end of the paragraph, on p. 151, cites the following references to Hahn\u2019s writings: Otto Hahn ''Einige pers\u00f6nliche Erinnerungen an Max Planck'' MPG, ''Mitteilungen'' (1957) p. 244, and Otto Hahn ''My Life'' (Herder and Herder, 1970) p. 140.</ref> Under Planck's leadership, the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, except concerning [[Fritz Haber]]. Planck tried to discuss the issue with [[Adolf Hitler]] but was unsuccessful. In the following year, 1934, Haber died in exile.\n\nOne year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for Haber. He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.\n\nAs the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, [[Johannes Stark]], prominent exponent of [[Deutsche Physik]] (\"German Physics\", also called \"Aryan Physics\") attacked Planck, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], calling them \"white Jews\". The \"Hauptamt Wissenschaft\" (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was \"1/16 Jewish\", but Planck himself denied it.<ref>Heilbron, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d5zKH2Bx2AwC&pg=PA191 page 191]</ref>\n\n[[File:Stadtfriedhof G\u00f6ttingen Max Planck Familie.jpg|thumb|Max Planck's grave in G\u00f6ttingen]]\nIn 1938, Planck celebrated his 80th birthday. The DPG held a celebration, during which the Max-Planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the DPG in 1928) was awarded to French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]]. At the end of 1938, the Prussian Academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by Nazis (''[[Gleichschaltung]]''). Planck protested by resigning his presidency. He continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on Religion and Science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the [[Alps]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the increasing number of Allied bombing missions against Berlin forced Planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. In 1942, he wrote: \"In me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise.\" In February 1944, his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. His rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the Allied armies from both sides.\n\nIn 1944, Planck's son [[Erwin Planck|Erwin]] was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] following the attempted assassination of Hitler in the [[20 July plot]]. He was tried and sentenced to death by the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] in October 1944. Erwin was hanged at Berlin's [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in January 1945. The death of his son destroyed much of Planck's will to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |title=Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck |accessdate=2010-06-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512151051/http://physics.nobel.brainparad.com/max_karl_ernst_ludwig_planck.html |archivedate=12 May 2008 }}</ref> After the end of the war Planck, his second wife, and his son by her were brought to a relative in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], where Planck died on October 4, 1947.

Retrieved on 2011-07-05.</ref>\nIn a lecture in 1937 entitled \"Religion und Naturwissenschaft\" (Religion and Natural Science) he suggested the importance of these symbols and rituals related directly with a believer's ability to worship God, but that one must be mindful that the symbols provide an imperfect illustration of divinity. He criticized atheism for being focused on the derision of such symbols, while at the same time warned of the over-estimation of the importance of such symbols by believers.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Max_Planck.aspx The Life Max Planck]. encyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-07.</ref>\n\nPlanck was tolerant and favorable to all religions. Although he remained in the Lutheran Church, he did not promote Christian or Biblical views. He believed \"the faith in miracles must yield, step by step, before the steady and firm advance of the facts of science, and its total defeat is undoubtedly a matter of time.\" <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Max_Planck.html|title=The religion of Max Planck, physicist|website=www.adherents.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1937 lecture \"Religion and Naturwissenschaft,\" Planck expressed the view that God is everywhere present, and held that \"the holiness of the unintelligible Godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols.\" Atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. He was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (though not necessarily a personal one). Both science and religion wage a \"tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition\" with the goal \"toward God!\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nPlanck said in 1944, \"As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit (orig. geist). This spirit is the matrix of all matter.\"<ref>Das Wesen der Materie [The Nature of Matter], speech at Florence, Italy (1944) (from Archiv zur Geschichte der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Abt. Va, Rep. 11 Planck, Nr. 1797)</ref>\n\nPlanck regarded the scientist as a man of imagination and Christian faith. He said: \"Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists He is at the end of all considerations\u2026 To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view\".<ref>Religion and Natural Science (Lecture Given 1937) Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans. F. Gaynor (New York, 1949), pp. 184 (from http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck)</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Planck wrote, \"...'to believe' means 'to recognize as a truth,' and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and simple, without doubt or criticism. The belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish completely.\"<ref>Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers</ref>\n\nLater in life, Planck's views on God were that of a [[deist]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dilemmas of an Upright Man: Max Planck and the Fortunes of German Science|year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674004399|author=J.

After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in [[Southern California]]. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\">{{cite web|title=Past Presidents of the University|url=http://www.redlands.edu/meet-redlands/office-of-the-president/past-presidents/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least $100,000 and {{convert|40|acre|ha}} for an interdenominational campus on land donated by a K.C. Wells. On June 27, 1907 the Commission voted in favor of the Redlands proposal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Founding|url=http://www.redlands.edu/meet-redlands/history-traditions/our-founding/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nGround was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending.\n\nOn January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion<ref>{{cite web|title=Alumni House|url=http://www.redlands.edu/event-services/weddings-and-receptions/alumni-house/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> were the only two other buildings completed. Now-university president Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for [[financial endowment|endowment]], but the [[1912 United States cold wave]], which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible.\n\nPresident Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> dean and mathematics professor, became the next president. The southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Memorial Chapel University of Redlands.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial Chapel]] -->\n\nBy 1925, the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, the University was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, a gymnasium, and Memorial Chapel<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorial Chapel|url=http://www.redlands.edu/event-services/weddings-and-receptions/memorial-chapel/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the University. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2.592 million, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.<ref>Nelson, Lawrence Emmerson, \"Redlands: Biography of a College, the first fifty years of the University of Redlands\" University of Redlands, CA 1958.</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression===\nBy the beginning of 1932, the effects of the [[Great Depression]] started to be felt at the university. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the university owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, President Duke died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]].\n\nThe administration of the university's third president, Clarence Howe Thurber,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> soon ran afoul of [[Conservatism|ultra-conservative]] churches. Student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of William H. Roberts, a psychology professor who became the campaign manager of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s run for governor in 1934, also severely strained [[town and gown]] relations.\n\n===During and after World War II===\nThe 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands particularly with the onset of direct U.S. involvement in [[World War II]]. As conscription and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]].\n\nThe July 1, 1943, arrival of a [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|Navy V-12]] unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands\u2019 largest enrollment ever, and gradually led to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the trustees finally discarded the \"no dancing\" policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.<ref>Moore, Frank E. \"Redlands, Our Town\" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, California, 1987</ref>\n\nThe passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veterans' families (\"Vets' Village\") were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, 70 of whom were married.\n\nThe 1950s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements were made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the university was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hunnex, in Philosophy.\n\nCompulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 1970s. The seventh president of the university, Dr. Douglas Moore,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> was not Baptist. The school went some years without clergymen on the Board of Trustees.\n\nFollowing Moore, James R. Appleton<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987\u20132005.\n\nDr. Stuart Dorsey<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005 to 2010.  During this period, the university opened the {{convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library, adding five computer laboratories and a caf\u00e9.

After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in [[Southern California]]. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\">{{cite web|title=Past Presidents of the University|url=http://www.redlands.edu/meet-redlands/office-of-the-president/past-presidents/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least $100,000 and {{convert|40|acre|ha}} for an interdenominational campus on land donated by a K.C. Wells. On June 27, 1907 the Commission voted in favor of the Redlands proposal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Founding|url=http://www.redlands.edu/meet-redlands/history-traditions/our-founding/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nGround was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending.\n\nOn January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion<ref>{{cite web|title=Alumni House|url=http://www.redlands.edu/event-services/weddings-and-receptions/alumni-house/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> were the only two other buildings completed. Now-university president Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for [[financial endowment|endowment]], but the [[1912 United States cold wave]], which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible.\n\nPresident Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> dean and mathematics professor, became the next president. The southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Memorial Chapel University of Redlands.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial Chapel]] -->\n\nBy 1925, the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, the University was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, a gymnasium, and Memorial Chapel<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorial Chapel|url=http://www.redlands.edu/event-services/weddings-and-receptions/memorial-chapel/|website=University of Redlands|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the University. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2.592 million, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.<ref>Nelson, Lawrence Emmerson, \"Redlands: Biography of a College, the first fifty years of the University of Redlands\" University of Redlands, CA 1958.</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression===\nBy the beginning of 1932, the effects of the [[Great Depression]] started to be felt at the university. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the university owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, President Duke died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]].\n\nThe administration of the university's third president, Clarence Howe Thurber,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> soon ran afoul of [[Conservatism|ultra-conservative]] churches. Student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of William H. Roberts, a psychology professor who became the campaign manager of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s run for governor in 1934, also severely strained [[town and gown]] relations.\n\n===During and after World War II===\nThe 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands particularly with the onset of direct U.S. involvement in [[World War II]]. As conscription and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]].\n\nThe July 1, 1943, arrival of a [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|Navy V-12]] unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands\u2019 largest enrollment ever, and gradually led to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the trustees finally discarded the \"no dancing\" policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.<ref>Moore, Frank E. \"Redlands, Our Town\" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, California, 1987</ref>\n\nThe passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veterans' families (\"Vets' Village\") were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, 70 of whom were married.\n\nThe 1950s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements were made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the university was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hunnex, in Philosophy.\n\nCompulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 1970s. The seventh president of the university, Dr. Douglas Moore,<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> was not Baptist. The school went some years without clergymen on the Board of Trustees.\n\nFollowing Moore, James R. Appleton<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987\u20132005.\n\nDr. Stuart Dorsey<ref name=\"Past Presidents of the University\"/> served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005 to 2010.  During this period, the university opened the {{convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library, adding five computer laboratories and a caf\u00e9. Dr. Dorsey resigned his position on March 16, 2010, amid controversy over budget deficits and proposed cuts.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Imran Ghori |author2=The Press-Enterprise |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_N_nredprez17.366a0f0.html |title=University of Redlands president quits over budget cuts &#124; San Bernardino County &#124; PE.com &#124; Southern California News &#124; News for Inland Southern California |publisher=PE.com |date=2010-03-16 |access-date=2010-11-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 17, 2010, the then-current chancellor and former president Dr. James R.

When a charity presents two victims over a singular victim results show that a significantly larger amount of donations are made towards the singular victim. Less affect was also found to be felt for the paired victims.<ref name=\"comp-fade\" /> This finding provides evidence of how compassion fade is caused by emotional reaction to a stimulus, as when people feel less affect, they are less likely to donate or provide help towards a cause. The researchers also measured the level to which participants believed their donation would make a difference to the children\u2019s lives. Comparisons between the singular child condition and the paired children condition show there was not a significant difference in perceived probability that the donation will improve their lives.<ref name=\"comp-fade\" />This shows how perceived utility is not causing this effect of compassion fade. Instead of making rational judgements in line with the [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility theory]] the singularity effect shows how compassion fade is the result of making decisions via the affect heuristic. \n\nThere have also been other proposed reasonings for the singularity effect. It has been proposed that the singularity effect occurs due to [[prospect theory]]<ref name=\"comp-fade\" />. This reasoning states that the singularity effect occurs because two is not perceived by the brain to have twice the utility of one so there is a diminishing sense of utility as the sample size increases. Additionally, other explanations state that the singularity effect only occurs when people have no prior knowledge to the situation they are making a decision on. In a study which looked at donations to help pandas, environmentalists evenly donated to both the single panda in need and a group of 8 pandas, whereas non-environmentalists donated a significantly larger amount to the single panda.<ref name=\":0\" />This shows how when participants are led to decide as an emotional response, as the non-environmentalist did, compared to those who already had substantial knowledge there is more evidence of compassion fade. This effect of compassion fade does not engage system two and only occurs when we are reliant on system 1. \n\n<br />\n\n=== '''The identifiable victim effect''' ===\nThe identifiable victim effect is an individual case of compassion fade where people are more likely to donate to an identified victim compared to an anonymous victim.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe identifiable victim effect can be seen through running [[Dictator game|Dictator games]] whereby in one condition the allocator is aware of the receiver\u2019s identity and in the other the allocator has no knowledge of the receivers identity. The results show that while the allocators did donate money in both conditions, a significantly larger amount was donated in the condition where the allocator was aware of the receiver\u2019s identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|title=Helping a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5\u201316|doi=10.1023/A:1022299422219|issn=1573-0476}}</ref>\n\nThe main reasoning behind the identifiable victim effect is that identified victims attract more attention than unidentified ones.\u00a0 This increased attention towards identified victims leads to an increased amount of affect felt resulting in people being more likely to feel compassion towards an identified cause. Similarly, to the singularity effect, the identifiable victim effect is an emotionally driven response. Identified victims illicit a greater distress response in individuals than non-identified victims leading to a greater number of contributions being made to the identified victim cause<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Kogut|first=Tehila|last2=Ritov|first2=Ilana|date=2005|title=The \u201cidentified victim\u201d effect: an identified group, or just a single individual?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdm.492|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=157\u2013167|doi=10.1002/bdm.492|issn=1099-0771}}</ref>.\n\nThere is an additional layer of complexity relating to the identifiable victim effect. There is a significant difference in the way people perceive a groups identity to an individuals identity. Identified individuals elicit greater affect than both non-identified individuals and identified groups. It has been found that identified groups do not gain more contributions than non-identified groups. This occurs because people perceive an individual as a more coherent unit than a group of individuals, meaning emotions and knowledge surrounding individuals are more accessible to the brain compared to information about a group.<ref name=\":2\" /> As the identifiable victim effect is caused by an emotional response the accessibility of these emotions is important. More accessible emotions relate to faster decisions meaning that individually identified victims receive more donations because the decision is faster and more intuitive.

These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the [[major and minor]] [[Key (music)|keys]] (sets that comprise all the [[enharmonic]] variants include 30 pieces).\n\nWell-known examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op.&nbsp;28]]. Such sets are often organized as [[prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]] or designated as [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] or [[\u00e9tude]]s. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys ([[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Transcendental \u00c9tudes]]'') or the sharp keys ([[Sergei Lyapunov]]'s Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively [[modulation (music)|modulate]] through a set of tonalities, as occurs in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.\n\nThe bulk of works of this type have been written for [[piano]] solo, but there also exist sets for piano [[Piano four hands|4-hands]]; two pianos; [[Organ (music)|organ]]; [[guitar]]; two guitars; [[flute]]; [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; [[oboe]]; [[violin]] solo; violin and piano; [[cello]] solo; cello and piano; [[Vocal music|voice]] and piano; and [[string quartet]]. There are examples of attempts to write full sets that, for one reason or another, were never completed ([[Josef Rheinberger]]'s organ sonatas, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s string quartets, [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''L'Organiste'').\n\n== Sets that cover all 24 keys ==\n\n===Most well-known sets===\nSome of the best-known examples of works covering all 24 major and minor keys are: \n* '''[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]''': ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Books I and II (1722 and 1742) \u2013 two separate sets of 24 [[Prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]], together known as \"the 48\".\n* '''[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]''': [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]] (1835\u201339)\n* '''[[Franz Liszt]]''': [[Transcendental \u00c9tudes|''Transcendental \u00c9tudes'', S. 139]] (1826\u201352) \u2013 It covers the natural and flat keys (the keys with flat signatures) only. Liszt originally planned to write the full suite of 24 \u00e9tudes, but apparently abandoned this plan. In 1897\u20131905, [[Sergei Lyapunov]] wrote his 12 ''\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante'', Op. 11, which covers the remaining sharp keys and is dedicated to Liszt's memory.<ref name=\"Hyperion Records, Leslie Howard\">\"[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66357 Liszt: The complete music for solo piano, Vol. 4 \u2013 Transcendental Studies performed by Leslie Howard]\", ''Hyperion-Records.co.uk''.</ref>\n* '''[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]''': [[Preludes, Op. 31 (Alkan)|25 Preludes, Op. 31]] (1847) \u2013 24 etudes in all the major and minor keys, Op. 35 and 39 (1848 and 1857)\n* '''[[Alexander Scriabin]]''': [[24 Preludes, Op. 11 (Scriabin)|24 Preludes, Op. 11]] (1893\u201395) \u2013 All told, Scriabin wrote a total of 90 preludes for piano (50 in major keys, 31 in minor keys, and 9 in indeterminate keys). These contained only ''one'' complete set of preludes in all 24 major and minor keys, but he seems to have started another set (spread over 4 opus numbers) before the key relationships broke down.\n* '''[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]''': [[Preludes (Rachmaninoff)|24 Preludes]], Opp. [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|3/2]], [[Preludes, Op. 23 (Rachmaninoff)|23]], and [[Preludes, Op. 32 (Rachmaninoff)|32]] (1892, 1901\u201303, and 1910) \u2013 it seems that Rachmaninoff did not originally set out to write a set of works in all 24 keys\n* '''[[Paul Hindemith]]''': ''[[Ludus Tonalis]]'' (1942) \u2013 twelve keys\n* '''[[Dmitri Shostakovich]]''': [[24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)|24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87]] (1950\u201351) \u2013 Shostakovich also wrote a separate set of [[24 Preludes, Op. 34 (Shostakovich)|24 Preludes, Op. 34]] in 1933.\n\n===Composers who wrote multiple sets===\n[[File:Niels Viggo Bentzon (1986) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Picture of [[Niels Viggo Bentzon]], who wrote 14 complete sets of 24 Preludes and Fugues.]]\nA number of composers have not been content with just one set of works covering all the keys of the scale.

In Prelude No. 1, each key occupies from 2 to 26 bars.  The keys of C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}}, which are enharmonically equivalent, are both represented. C major both opens and closes the set.  In Prelude No. 2, the cycle of keys appears twice; in the first cycle, the number of bars per key ranges from 1 to 8; in the second half, after C every new key signature lasts for only one bar; the cycle concludes with 15 bars of C major.  There is no evidence that Beethoven intended to write similar sets in the 12 minor keys.\n\n[[Giovanni Battista Vitali]] (1632\u20131692) included in [[Giovanni Battista Vitali#Artificii musicali|''Artificii musicali'', Op. 13]] (1689) a [[passacaglia]] which modulates through eight major keys (out of twelve) from E{{music|flat}} major to E major through the cycle of fifths.\n[[File:Reicha - fugue 8.flac|thumb|The eighth fugue from [[Anton Reicha|Reicha]]'s [[36 Fugues (Reicha)|36 Fugues]].]]\nFugue No. 8 from [[Anton Reicha]]'s ''[[36 Fugues (Reicha)|Trente six Fugues pour le Piano-Fort\u00e9 compos\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s un nouveau syst\u00eame]]'' (subtitled ''Cercle harmonique'') modulates through all keys.\n\nThe [[rondo]] theme of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''[[Le b\u0153uf sur le toit]]'' is played fifteen times in all 12 major keys (twice in A major and thrice in the tonic, C major). It also passes through every minor key except E minor and B minor.\n\n===Works covering all eight church modes===\n\nAround 1704, [[Johann Pachelbel]] completed his 95 ''Magnificat Fugues'', which covered all eight of the [[Gregorian mode|church modes]].\n \n[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] composed ''Petits pr\u00e9ludes sur les huit gammes du plain-chant'', for organ (1859, no opus number), a sequence of eight organ preludes covering each of the church modes.\n\nIn the music of the [[Orthodox Church]], the doxasticon for [[Vespers]] of the [[Dormition]] is notable as a single hymn that includes passages in all eight tones of the Byzantine [[Octoechos]].<ref>John Sanidopoulos, [https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/08/the-unique-eight-toned-hymn-of.html The Unique Eight Toned Hymn of the Dormition of the Theotokos], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other sets of 24 pieces===\nNot all sets of 24 pieces belong in this category. For example, there was no intention in [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] for solo violin, [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|24 Pr\u00e9ludes]] for piano, or Pavel Zemek Novak's 24&nbsp;Preludes and Fugues for piano<ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Pavel-Zemek-Nov%C3%A1k/Composer/193094-1 ArkivMusic]. Retrieved 10 April 2013</ref> to cover all the keys. (Paganini may not have been aware of [[Pierre Rode]]'s [[24 Caprices for Violin (Rode)|24 Caprices for violin]], which did span the 24 keys and were written almost as the same time as Paganini's.)\n\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[\u00c9tudes (Chopin)|24 \u00c9tudes, Opp. 10 & 25]] might have originally been planned to be in all 24 keys. In fact, apart from Nos. 7 and 8, the first series (Op. 10) is made of couples of \u00e9tudes in a major key and its parallel minor (the major key either preceding the minor key or following it) with none of the tonalities occurring twice (except for C major, which appears in No. 1 and then in the only couple which is not major-minor, i.e. Nos. 7 and 8). But in the second series (Op. 25) this tonal scheme gets more and more loose. It is still possible to see connections on a tonal basis between the couples of \u00e9tudes in Op. 25, but they are not based on one principle (e.g. Nos. 3 and 4 in F major \u2013 A minor, two tonalities which Chopin likes to put together very often, as in his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|second ''Ballade'']]).\n\nOne might suppose that Chopin considered writing the \u00e9tudes in all the tonalities but eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical and turned back to it later, for the [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]]. The fact that the first \u00e9tude of Op. 10 is made of [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] in C major draws a connection to Bach's first book of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and makes it clear that Chopin had the tradition on his mind.{{or|date=August 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Bach and his precursors===\n{{See also|The Well-Tempered Clavier#Precursors}}\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', two complete sets of 24 Preludes and Fugues written for keyboard in 1722 and 1742, and often known as \"the 48\", is generally considered the greatest example of music traversing all 24 keys. Many later composers clearly modelled their sets on Bach's, including the order of the keys.\n\nIt was long believed that Bach had taken the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' from a similarly-named set of 24 Preludes and Fugues in all the keys, for which a manuscript dated 1689 was found in the library of the [[Brussels Conservatoire]]. It was later shown that this was the work of a composer who was not even born by 1689: Bernhard Christian Weber (1712\u20131758). In fact, the work was written in 1745\u201350 in imitation of Bach's example.<ref>''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 5th ed, 1954, Vol. IX, p. 223.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.erpmusic.com/records/cds/the-well-tempered-clavier-I The Well-Tempered Clavier I]\", ''ERPmusic.com''.</ref> While Bach can safely claim the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'', he was not the earliest composer to write sets of pieces in all the keys:\n\nAs early as 1567, {{ill|Giacomo Gorzanis|it||de||ca||fr}} (c.1520\u2013c.1577) wrote a cycle of 24 passamezzo\u2013saltarello pairs.{{citation needed|reason=This statement was never supported with any source, reliable or not; a source, preferably reliable, is needed|date=May 2018}} In 1584, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], father of [[Galileo Galilei]], wrote a Codex of pieces illustrating the use of all 24 major and minor keys.<ref>[http://www.recprderhomepage.net/galilee.html Ricercares a quattro voci by Vincenzo Galilei, 1584] {{deadlink|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This statement may or may not have been supported by the source given, which may or may not have been reliable, but that is no longer available, so a new source, preferably reliable, is needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1640, [[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] wrote ''Libro primo di chitarra spagnola'', a cycle of [[passacaglia]]s that moves through all 24 major and minor keys according to the [[circle of fifths]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640bartolotti.html |title=Bartolotti, Angelo Michele |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820141829/http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640bartolotti.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 }}</ref> Also in 1640, [[Antonio Carbonchi]] wrote ''Sonate di chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese'' for guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640carbonchi.html |title=\"Antonio Carbonchi, Sonate di chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese \u2026 (1640)\", ''Library.Appstate.edu'' |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820141942/http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640carbonchi.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1702, [[Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer]] wrote a cycle of 20 organ pieces all in different keys in his ''[[Ariadne musica]]''.

This gives 24 possible keys, but each note can be represented by several [[enharmonic]] note names (note names which designate the same actual note in the 12 note octave such as G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}}) and so each key can be represented by several enharmonic key names (e.g. G{{music|sharp}} minor and A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\nIn practice, the choice of key name is restricted to the 30 keys whose signatures have no double flats or double sharps. (Such key signatures are used for so-called [[theoretical key]]s which are almost never encountered outside music-theoretical exercises.){{efn|In extremely rare cases, theoretical keys do appear with their double-accidental key signatures in real music: an example is [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', which ends in [[G-sharp major]] with F{{music|x}} in the key signature.<ref>http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/14652</ref> However, no set of pieces in all 24 keys that includes a theoretical key is known.}} Keys with 6 flats and 6 sharps,{{efn|G{{music|flat}} major and F{{music|sharp}} major, E{{music|flat}} minor and D{{music|sharp}} minor}} with 7 flats and 5 sharps{{efn|C{{music|flat}} major and B major, A{{music|flat}} minor and G{{music|sharp}} minor}} and with 5 flats and 7 sharps{{efn|D{{music|flat}} major and C{{music|sharp}} major, B{{music|flat}} minor and A{{music|sharp}} minor}} are enharmonic to one another. Composers will, in most (though not all) cases, choose only one key from each enharmonic pair. But there are also cases of sets covering all 30 keys, which, in other words, include all enharmonic variants.\n\nThe table below outlines the choices made in the various collections listed here.

[[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] used this approach as early as 1640, and it was also adopted by such later composers as [[Pierre Rode|Rode]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Stephen Heller|Heller]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Dmitry Kabalevsky|Kabalevsky]] and [[Nikolai Kapustin|Kapustin]].\n\nIn [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and some other earlier sets, major keys were followed by their [[parallel key|parallel minor]] keys. The Bach order was adopted by [[Anton Arensky|Arensky]], [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re|Gli\u00e8re]], [[York Bowen]] and others. \n\nOther composers derived their own schemas based on certain logical rationales. For example, in [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]]\u2019s 25 Preludes, Op. 31, the sequence of keys moves alternately up a fourth and down a third. \n\nYet others used no systematic ordering. [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]], [[Selim Palmgren|Palmgren]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco|Castelnuovo-Tedesco]]'s works are examples of this.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/short.htm ''The Short-Tempered Clavier: Preludes and Fugues in all the Major and Minor Keys Except for the Really Hard Ones'', S. easy as 3.14159265 (P.D.Q.

Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', which covers all 24 major and minor keys.</center>]]\n\nThere is a long tradition in [[classical music]] of writing music in '''sets of pieces that cover all the major and minor [[Key (music)|keys]]''' of the [[chromatic scale]]. These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the [[major and minor]] [[Key (music)|keys]] (sets that comprise all the [[enharmonic]] variants include 30 pieces).\n\nWell-known examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op.&nbsp;28]]. Such sets are often organized as [[prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]] or designated as [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] or [[\u00e9tude]]s. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys ([[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Transcendental \u00c9tudes]]'') or the sharp keys ([[Sergei Lyapunov]]'s Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively [[modulation (music)|modulate]] through a set of tonalities, as occurs in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.\n\nThe bulk of works of this type have been written for [[piano]] solo, but there also exist sets for piano [[Piano four hands|4-hands]]; two pianos; [[Organ (music)|organ]]; [[guitar]]; two guitars; [[flute]]; [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; [[oboe]]; [[violin]] solo; violin and piano; [[cello]] solo; cello and piano; [[Vocal music|voice]] and piano; and [[string quartet]]. There are examples of attempts to write full sets that, for one reason or another, were never completed ([[Josef Rheinberger]]'s organ sonatas, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s string quartets, [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''L'Organiste'').\n\n== Sets that cover all 24 keys ==\n\n===Most well-known sets===\nSome of the best-known examples of works covering all 24 major and minor keys are: \n* '''[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]''': ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Books I and II (1722 and 1742) \u2013 two separate sets of 24 [[Prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]], together known as \"the 48\".\n* '''[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]''': [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]] (1835\u201339)\n* '''[[Franz Liszt]]''': [[Transcendental \u00c9tudes|''Transcendental \u00c9tudes'', S. 139]] (1826\u201352) \u2013 It covers the natural and flat keys (the keys with flat signatures) only. Liszt originally planned to write the full suite of 24 \u00e9tudes, but apparently abandoned this plan. In 1897\u20131905, [[Sergei Lyapunov]] wrote his 12 ''\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante'', Op. 11, which covers the remaining sharp keys and is dedicated to Liszt's memory.<ref name=\"Hyperion Records, Leslie Howard\">\"[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66357 Liszt: The complete music for solo piano, Vol. 4 \u2013 Transcendental Studies performed by Leslie Howard]\", ''Hyperion-Records.co.uk''.</ref>\n* '''[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]''': [[Preludes, Op. 31 (Alkan)|25 Preludes, Op. 31]] (1847) \u2013 24 etudes in all the major and minor keys, Op. 35 and 39 (1848 and 1857)\n* '''[[Alexander Scriabin]]''': [[24 Preludes, Op. 11 (Scriabin)|24 Preludes, Op. 11]] (1893\u201395) \u2013 All told, Scriabin wrote a total of 90 preludes for piano (50 in major keys, 31 in minor keys, and 9 in indeterminate keys).

In Prelude No. 1, each key occupies from 2 to 26 bars.  The keys of C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}}, which are enharmonically equivalent, are both represented. C major both opens and closes the set.  In Prelude No. 2, the cycle of keys appears twice; in the first cycle, the number of bars per key ranges from 1 to 8; in the second half, after C every new key signature lasts for only one bar; the cycle concludes with 15 bars of C major.  There is no evidence that Beethoven intended to write similar sets in the 12 minor keys.\n\n[[Giovanni Battista Vitali]] (1632\u20131692) included in [[Giovanni Battista Vitali#Artificii musicali|''Artificii musicali'', Op. 13]] (1689) a [[passacaglia]] which modulates through eight major keys (out of twelve) from E{{music|flat}} major to E major through the cycle of fifths.\n[[File:Reicha - fugue 8.flac|thumb|The eighth fugue from [[Anton Reicha|Reicha]]'s [[36 Fugues (Reicha)|36 Fugues]].]]\nFugue No. 8 from [[Anton Reicha]]'s ''[[36 Fugues (Reicha)|Trente six Fugues pour le Piano-Fort\u00e9 compos\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s un nouveau syst\u00eame]]'' (subtitled ''Cercle harmonique'') modulates through all keys.\n\nThe [[rondo]] theme of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''[[Le b\u0153uf sur le toit]]'' is played fifteen times in all 12 major keys (twice in A major and thrice in the tonic, C major). It also passes through every minor key except E minor and B minor.\n\n===Works covering all eight church modes===\n\nAround 1704, [[Johann Pachelbel]] completed his 95 ''Magnificat Fugues'', which covered all eight of the [[Gregorian mode|church modes]].\n \n[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] composed ''Petits pr\u00e9ludes sur les huit gammes du plain-chant'', for organ (1859, no opus number), a sequence of eight organ preludes covering each of the church modes.\n\nIn the music of the [[Orthodox Church]], the doxasticon for [[Vespers]] of the [[Dormition]] is notable as a single hymn that includes passages in all eight tones of the Byzantine [[Octoechos]].<ref>John Sanidopoulos, [https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/08/the-unique-eight-toned-hymn-of.html The Unique Eight Toned Hymn of the Dormition of the Theotokos], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other sets of 24 pieces===\nNot all sets of 24 pieces belong in this category. For example, there was no intention in [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] for solo violin, [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|24 Pr\u00e9ludes]] for piano, or Pavel Zemek Novak's 24&nbsp;Preludes and Fugues for piano<ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Pavel-Zemek-Nov%C3%A1k/Composer/193094-1 ArkivMusic]. Retrieved 10 April 2013</ref> to cover all the keys. (Paganini may not have been aware of [[Pierre Rode]]'s [[24 Caprices for Violin (Rode)|24 Caprices for violin]], which did span the 24 keys and were written almost as the same time as Paganini's.)\n\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[\u00c9tudes (Chopin)|24 \u00c9tudes, Opp. 10 & 25]] might have originally been planned to be in all 24 keys. In fact, apart from Nos. 7 and 8, the first series (Op. 10) is made of couples of \u00e9tudes in a major key and its parallel minor (the major key either preceding the minor key or following it) with none of the tonalities occurring twice (except for C major, which appears in No. 1 and then in the only couple which is not major-minor, i.e. Nos. 7 and 8). But in the second series (Op. 25) this tonal scheme gets more and more loose. It is still possible to see connections on a tonal basis between the couples of \u00e9tudes in Op. 25, but they are not based on one principle (e.g. Nos. 3 and 4 in F major \u2013 A minor, two tonalities which Chopin likes to put together very often, as in his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|second ''Ballade'']]).\n\nOne might suppose that Chopin considered writing the \u00e9tudes in all the tonalities but eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical and turned back to it later, for the [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]]. The fact that the first \u00e9tude of Op. 10 is made of [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] in C major draws a connection to Bach's first book of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and makes it clear that Chopin had the tradition on his mind.{{or|date=August 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Bach and his precursors===\n{{See also|The Well-Tempered Clavier#Precursors}}\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', two complete sets of 24 Preludes and Fugues written for keyboard in 1722 and 1742, and often known as \"the 48\", is generally considered the greatest example of music traversing all 24 keys. Many later composers clearly modelled their sets on Bach's, including the order of the keys.\n\nIt was long believed that Bach had taken the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' from a similarly-named set of 24 Preludes and Fugues in all the keys, for which a manuscript dated 1689 was found in the library of the [[Brussels Conservatoire]]. It was later shown that this was the work of a composer who was not even born by 1689: Bernhard Christian Weber (1712\u20131758).

This gives 24 possible keys, but each note can be represented by several [[enharmonic]] note names (note names which designate the same actual note in the 12 note octave such as G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}}) and so each key can be represented by several enharmonic key names (e.g. G{{music|sharp}} minor and A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\nIn practice, the choice of key name is restricted to the 30 keys whose signatures have no double flats or double sharps. (Such key signatures are used for so-called [[theoretical key]]s which are almost never encountered outside music-theoretical exercises.){{efn|In extremely rare cases, theoretical keys do appear with their double-accidental key signatures in real music: an example is [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', which ends in [[G-sharp major]] with F{{music|x}} in the key signature.<ref>http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/14652</ref> However, no set of pieces in all 24 keys that includes a theoretical key is known.}} Keys with 6 flats and 6 sharps,{{efn|G{{music|flat}} major and F{{music|sharp}} major, E{{music|flat}} minor and D{{music|sharp}} minor}} with 7 flats and 5 sharps{{efn|C{{music|flat}} major and B major, A{{music|flat}} minor and G{{music|sharp}} minor}} and with 5 flats and 7 sharps{{efn|D{{music|flat}} major and C{{music|sharp}} major, B{{music|flat}} minor and A{{music|sharp}} minor}} are enharmonic to one another. Composers will, in most (though not all) cases, choose only one key from each enharmonic pair. But there are also cases of sets covering all 30 keys, which, in other words, include all enharmonic variants.\n\nThe table below outlines the choices made in the various collections listed here. The keys are in the order that J.S. Bach used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!\n!'''Key'''\n!'''Key signature'''\n!'''Comments'''\n|-\n| 1\n| [[C major]]\n| No&nbsp;[[sharp (music)|sharps]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[flat (music)|flats]]\n|\n|-\n| 2\n| [[C minor]]\n| 3 flats\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3\n| Either [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| 7 sharps\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]] chose C{{music|sharp}} major, but most composers have preferred D{{music|flat}} major\n|-\n| or [[D-flat major|D{{music|flat}} major]]\n| 5 flats\n|-\n| 4\n| [[C-sharp minor|C{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| 4 sharps\n| <!--But not [[D-flat minor]], which has 6 flats and 1 double flat.-->\n|-\n| 5\n| [[D major]]\n| 2 sharps\n|\n|-\n| 6\n| [[D minor]]\n| 1 flat\n|\n|-\n| 7\n| [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]]\n| 3 flats\n| <!--But not [[D-sharp major]], which has 5 sharps and 2 double sharps.-->\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| Either [[D-sharp minor|D{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| 6 sharps\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Most composers of sets of 24 pieces have chosen E{{music|flat}} minor over D{{music|sharp}} minor.

[[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] used this approach as early as 1640, and it was also adopted by such later composers as [[Pierre Rode|Rode]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Stephen Heller|Heller]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Dmitry Kabalevsky|Kabalevsky]] and [[Nikolai Kapustin|Kapustin]].\n\nIn [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and some other earlier sets, major keys were followed by their [[parallel key|parallel minor]] keys. The Bach order was adopted by [[Anton Arensky|Arensky]], [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re|Gli\u00e8re]], [[York Bowen]] and others. \n\nOther composers derived their own schemas based on certain logical rationales. For example, in [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]]\u2019s 25 Preludes, Op. 31, the sequence of keys moves alternately up a fourth and down a third. \n\nYet others used no systematic ordering. [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]], [[Selim Palmgren|Palmgren]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco|Castelnuovo-Tedesco]]'s works are examples of this.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/short.htm ''The Short-Tempered Clavier: Preludes and Fugues in all the Major and Minor Keys Except for the Really Hard Ones'', S. easy as 3.14159265 (P.D.Q.

Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', which covers all 24 major and minor keys.</center>]]\n\nThere is a long tradition in [[classical music]] of writing music in '''sets of pieces that cover all the major and minor [[Key (music)|keys]]''' of the [[chromatic scale]]. These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the [[major and minor]] [[Key (music)|keys]] (sets that comprise all the [[enharmonic]] variants include 30 pieces).\n\nWell-known examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op.&nbsp;28]]. Such sets are often organized as [[prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]] or designated as [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] or [[\u00e9tude]]s. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys ([[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Transcendental \u00c9tudes]]'') or the sharp keys ([[Sergei Lyapunov]]'s Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively [[modulation (music)|modulate]] through a set of tonalities, as occurs in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.\n\nThe bulk of works of this type have been written for [[piano]] solo, but there also exist sets for piano [[Piano four hands|4-hands]]; two pianos; [[Organ (music)|organ]]; [[guitar]]; two guitars; [[flute]]; [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; [[oboe]]; [[violin]] solo; violin and piano; [[cello]] solo; cello and piano; [[Vocal music|voice]] and piano; and [[string quartet]]. There are examples of attempts to write full sets that, for one reason or another, were never completed ([[Josef Rheinberger]]'s organ sonatas, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s string quartets, [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''L'Organiste'').\n\n== Sets that cover all 24 keys ==\n\n===Most well-known sets===\nSome of the best-known examples of works covering all 24 major and minor keys are: \n* '''[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]''': ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Books I and II (1722 and 1742) \u2013 two separate sets of 24 [[Prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]], together known as \"the 48\".\n* '''[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]''': [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]] (1835\u201339)\n* '''[[Franz Liszt]]''': [[Transcendental \u00c9tudes|''Transcendental \u00c9tudes'', S. 139]] (1826\u201352) \u2013 It covers the natural and flat keys (the keys with flat signatures) only. Liszt originally planned to write the full suite of 24 \u00e9tudes, but apparently abandoned this plan. In 1897\u20131905, [[Sergei Lyapunov]] wrote his 12 ''\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante'', Op. 11, which covers the remaining sharp keys and is dedicated to Liszt's memory.<ref name=\"Hyperion Records, Leslie Howard\">\"[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66357 Liszt: The complete music for solo piano, Vol. 4 \u2013 Transcendental Studies performed by Leslie Howard]\", ''Hyperion-Records.co.uk''.</ref>\n* '''[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]''': [[Preludes, Op. 31 (Alkan)|25 Preludes, Op. 31]] (1847) \u2013 24 etudes in all the major and minor keys, Op. 35 and 39 (1848 and 1857)\n* '''[[Alexander Scriabin]]''': [[24 Preludes, Op. 11 (Scriabin)|24 Preludes, Op. 11]] (1893\u201395) \u2013 All told, Scriabin wrote a total of 90 preludes for piano (50 in major keys, 31 in minor keys, and 9 in indeterminate keys).

In Prelude No. 1, each key occupies from 2 to 26 bars.  The keys of C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}}, which are enharmonically equivalent, are both represented. C major both opens and closes the set.  In Prelude No. 2, the cycle of keys appears twice; in the first cycle, the number of bars per key ranges from 1 to 8; in the second half, after C every new key signature lasts for only one bar; the cycle concludes with 15 bars of C major.  There is no evidence that Beethoven intended to write similar sets in the 12 minor keys.\n\n[[Giovanni Battista Vitali]] (1632\u20131692) included in [[Giovanni Battista Vitali#Artificii musicali|''Artificii musicali'', Op. 13]] (1689) a [[passacaglia]] which modulates through eight major keys (out of twelve) from E{{music|flat}} major to E major through the cycle of fifths.\n[[File:Reicha - fugue 8.flac|thumb|The eighth fugue from [[Anton Reicha|Reicha]]'s [[36 Fugues (Reicha)|36 Fugues]].]]\nFugue No. 8 from [[Anton Reicha]]'s ''[[36 Fugues (Reicha)|Trente six Fugues pour le Piano-Fort\u00e9 compos\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s un nouveau syst\u00eame]]'' (subtitled ''Cercle harmonique'') modulates through all keys.\n\nThe [[rondo]] theme of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''[[Le b\u0153uf sur le toit]]'' is played fifteen times in all 12 major keys (twice in A major and thrice in the tonic, C major). It also passes through every minor key except E minor and B minor.\n\n===Works covering all eight church modes===\n\nAround 1704, [[Johann Pachelbel]] completed his 95 ''Magnificat Fugues'', which covered all eight of the [[Gregorian mode|church modes]].\n \n[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] composed ''Petits pr\u00e9ludes sur les huit gammes du plain-chant'', for organ (1859, no opus number), a sequence of eight organ preludes covering each of the church modes.\n\nIn the music of the [[Orthodox Church]], the doxasticon for [[Vespers]] of the [[Dormition]] is notable as a single hymn that includes passages in all eight tones of the Byzantine [[Octoechos]].<ref>John Sanidopoulos, [https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/08/the-unique-eight-toned-hymn-of.html The Unique Eight Toned Hymn of the Dormition of the Theotokos], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other sets of 24 pieces===\nNot all sets of 24 pieces belong in this category. For example, there was no intention in [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] for solo violin, [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|24 Pr\u00e9ludes]] for piano, or Pavel Zemek Novak's 24&nbsp;Preludes and Fugues for piano<ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Pavel-Zemek-Nov%C3%A1k/Composer/193094-1 ArkivMusic]. Retrieved 10 April 2013</ref> to cover all the keys. (Paganini may not have been aware of [[Pierre Rode]]'s [[24 Caprices for Violin (Rode)|24 Caprices for violin]], which did span the 24 keys and were written almost as the same time as Paganini's.)\n\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[\u00c9tudes (Chopin)|24 \u00c9tudes, Opp. 10 & 25]] might have originally been planned to be in all 24 keys. In fact, apart from Nos. 7 and 8, the first series (Op. 10) is made of couples of \u00e9tudes in a major key and its parallel minor (the major key either preceding the minor key or following it) with none of the tonalities occurring twice (except for C major, which appears in No. 1 and then in the only couple which is not major-minor, i.e. Nos. 7 and 8). But in the second series (Op. 25) this tonal scheme gets more and more loose. It is still possible to see connections on a tonal basis between the couples of \u00e9tudes in Op. 25, but they are not based on one principle (e.g. Nos. 3 and 4 in F major \u2013 A minor, two tonalities which Chopin likes to put together very often, as in his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|second ''Ballade'']]).\n\nOne might suppose that Chopin considered writing the \u00e9tudes in all the tonalities but eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical and turned back to it later, for the [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]]. The fact that the first \u00e9tude of Op. 10 is made of [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] in C major draws a connection to Bach's first book of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and makes it clear that Chopin had the tradition on his mind.{{or|date=August 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Bach and his precursors===\n{{See also|The Well-Tempered Clavier#Precursors}}\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', two complete sets of 24 Preludes and Fugues written for keyboard in 1722 and 1742, and often known as \"the 48\", is generally considered the greatest example of music traversing all 24 keys. Many later composers clearly modelled their sets on Bach's, including the order of the keys.\n\nIt was long believed that Bach had taken the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' from a similarly-named set of 24 Preludes and Fugues in all the keys, for which a manuscript dated 1689 was found in the library of the [[Brussels Conservatoire]]. It was later shown that this was the work of a composer who was not even born by 1689: Bernhard Christian Weber (1712\u20131758). In fact, the work was written in 1745\u201350 in imitation of Bach's example.<ref>''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 5th ed, 1954, Vol. IX, p. 223.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.erpmusic.com/records/cds/the-well-tempered-clavier-I The Well-Tempered Clavier I]\", ''ERPmusic.com''.</ref> While Bach can safely claim the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'', he was not the earliest composer to write sets of pieces in all the keys:\n\nAs early as 1567, {{ill|Giacomo Gorzanis|it||de||ca||fr}} (c.1520\u2013c.1577) wrote a cycle of 24 passamezzo\u2013saltarello pairs.{{citation needed|reason=This statement was never supported with any source, reliable or not; a source, preferably reliable, is needed|date=May 2018}} In 1584, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], father of [[Galileo Galilei]], wrote a Codex of pieces illustrating the use of all 24 major and minor keys.<ref>[http://www.recprderhomepage.net/galilee.html Ricercares a quattro voci by Vincenzo Galilei, 1584] {{deadlink|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This statement may or may not have been supported by the source given, which may or may not have been reliable, but that is no longer available, so a new source, preferably reliable, is needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1640, [[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] wrote ''Libro primo di chitarra spagnola'', a cycle of [[passacaglia]]s that moves through all 24 major and minor keys according to the [[circle of fifths]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640bartolotti.html |title=Bartolotti, Angelo Michele |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820141829/http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640bartolotti.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 }}</ref> Also in 1640, [[Antonio Carbonchi]] wrote ''Sonate di chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese'' for guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640carbonchi.html |title=\"Antonio Carbonchi, Sonate di chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese \u2026 (1640)\", ''Library.Appstate.edu'' |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820141942/http://www.library.appstate.edu/music/guitar/1640carbonchi.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1702, [[Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer]] wrote a cycle of 20 organ pieces all in different keys in his ''[[Ariadne musica]]''.

This gives 24 possible keys, but each note can be represented by several [[enharmonic]] note names (note names which designate the same actual note in the 12 note octave such as G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}}) and so each key can be represented by several enharmonic key names (e.g. G{{music|sharp}} minor and A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\nIn practice, the choice of key name is restricted to the 30 keys whose signatures have no double flats or double sharps. (Such key signatures are used for so-called [[theoretical key]]s which are almost never encountered outside music-theoretical exercises.){{efn|In extremely rare cases, theoretical keys do appear with their double-accidental key signatures in real music: an example is [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', which ends in [[G-sharp major]] with F{{music|x}} in the key signature.<ref>http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/14652</ref> However, no set of pieces in all 24 keys that includes a theoretical key is known.}} Keys with 6 flats and 6 sharps,{{efn|G{{music|flat}} major and F{{music|sharp}} major, E{{music|flat}} minor and D{{music|sharp}} minor}} with 7 flats and 5 sharps{{efn|C{{music|flat}} major and B major, A{{music|flat}} minor and G{{music|sharp}} minor}} and with 5 flats and 7 sharps{{efn|D{{music|flat}} major and C{{music|sharp}} major, B{{music|flat}} minor and A{{music|sharp}} minor}} are enharmonic to one another. Composers will, in most (though not all) cases, choose only one key from each enharmonic pair.

[[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] used this approach as early as 1640, and it was also adopted by such later composers as [[Pierre Rode|Rode]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Stephen Heller|Heller]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Dmitry Kabalevsky|Kabalevsky]] and [[Nikolai Kapustin|Kapustin]].\n\nIn [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and some other earlier sets, major keys were followed by their [[parallel key|parallel minor]] keys. The Bach order was adopted by [[Anton Arensky|Arensky]], [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re|Gli\u00e8re]], [[York Bowen]] and others. \n\nOther composers derived their own schemas based on certain logical rationales. For example, in [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]]\u2019s 25 Preludes, Op. 31, the sequence of keys moves alternately up a fourth and down a third. \n\nYet others used no systematic ordering. [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]], [[Selim Palmgren|Palmgren]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco|Castelnuovo-Tedesco]]'s works are examples of this.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/short.htm ''The Short-Tempered Clavier: Preludes and Fugues in all the Major and Minor Keys Except for the Really Hard Ones'', S. easy as 3.14159265 (P.D.Q.

Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', which covers all 24 major and minor keys.</center>]]\n\nThere is a long tradition in [[classical music]] of writing music in '''sets of pieces that cover all the major and minor [[Key (music)|keys]]''' of the [[chromatic scale]]. These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the [[major and minor]] [[Key (music)|keys]] (sets that comprise all the [[enharmonic]] variants include 30 pieces).\n\nWell-known examples include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op.&nbsp;28]]. Such sets are often organized as [[prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]] or designated as [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] or [[\u00e9tude]]s. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys ([[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Transcendental \u00c9tudes]]'') or the sharp keys ([[Sergei Lyapunov]]'s Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively [[modulation (music)|modulate]] through a set of tonalities, as occurs in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.\n\nThe bulk of works of this type have been written for [[piano]] solo, but there also exist sets for piano [[Piano four hands|4-hands]]; two pianos; [[Organ (music)|organ]]; [[guitar]]; two guitars; [[flute]]; [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]; [[oboe]]; [[violin]] solo; violin and piano; [[cello]] solo; cello and piano; [[Vocal music|voice]] and piano; and [[string quartet]]. There are examples of attempts to write full sets that, for one reason or another, were never completed ([[Josef Rheinberger]]'s organ sonatas, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s string quartets, [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''L'Organiste'').\n\n== Sets that cover all 24 keys ==\n\n===Most well-known sets===\nSome of the best-known examples of works covering all 24 major and minor keys are: \n* '''[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]''': ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Books I and II (1722 and 1742) \u2013 two separate sets of 24 [[Prelude and fugue|preludes and fugues]], together known as \"the 48\".\n* '''[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]''': [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]] (1835\u201339)\n* '''[[Franz Liszt]]''': [[Transcendental \u00c9tudes|''Transcendental \u00c9tudes'', S. 139]] (1826\u201352) \u2013 It covers the natural and flat keys (the keys with flat signatures) only. Liszt originally planned to write the full suite of 24 \u00e9tudes, but apparently abandoned this plan. In 1897\u20131905, [[Sergei Lyapunov]] wrote his 12 ''\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante'', Op. 11, which covers the remaining sharp keys and is dedicated to Liszt's memory.<ref name=\"Hyperion Records, Leslie Howard\">\"[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66357 Liszt: The complete music for solo piano, Vol. 4 \u2013 Transcendental Studies performed by Leslie Howard]\", ''Hyperion-Records.co.uk''.</ref>\n* '''[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]''': [[Preludes, Op. 31 (Alkan)|25 Preludes, Op. 31]] (1847) \u2013 24 etudes in all the major and minor keys, Op. 35 and 39 (1848 and 1857)\n* '''[[Alexander Scriabin]]''': [[24 Preludes, Op. 11 (Scriabin)|24 Preludes, Op. 11]] (1893\u201395) \u2013 All told, Scriabin wrote a total of 90 preludes for piano (50 in major keys, 31 in minor keys, and 9 in indeterminate keys).

In Prelude No. 1, each key occupies from 2 to 26 bars.  The keys of C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}}, which are enharmonically equivalent, are both represented. C major both opens and closes the set.  In Prelude No. 2, the cycle of keys appears twice; in the first cycle, the number of bars per key ranges from 1 to 8; in the second half, after C every new key signature lasts for only one bar; the cycle concludes with 15 bars of C major.  There is no evidence that Beethoven intended to write similar sets in the 12 minor keys.\n\n[[Giovanni Battista Vitali]] (1632\u20131692) included in [[Giovanni Battista Vitali#Artificii musicali|''Artificii musicali'', Op. 13]] (1689) a [[passacaglia]] which modulates through eight major keys (out of twelve) from E{{music|flat}} major to E major through the cycle of fifths.\n[[File:Reicha - fugue 8.flac|thumb|The eighth fugue from [[Anton Reicha|Reicha]]'s [[36 Fugues (Reicha)|36 Fugues]].]]\nFugue No. 8 from [[Anton Reicha]]'s ''[[36 Fugues (Reicha)|Trente six Fugues pour le Piano-Fort\u00e9 compos\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s un nouveau syst\u00eame]]'' (subtitled ''Cercle harmonique'') modulates through all keys.\n\nThe [[rondo]] theme of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''[[Le b\u0153uf sur le toit]]'' is played fifteen times in all 12 major keys (twice in A major and thrice in the tonic, C major). It also passes through every minor key except E minor and B minor.\n\n===Works covering all eight church modes===\n\nAround 1704, [[Johann Pachelbel]] completed his 95 ''Magnificat Fugues'', which covered all eight of the [[Gregorian mode|church modes]].\n \n[[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] composed ''Petits pr\u00e9ludes sur les huit gammes du plain-chant'', for organ (1859, no opus number), a sequence of eight organ preludes covering each of the church modes.\n\nIn the music of the [[Orthodox Church]], the doxasticon for [[Vespers]] of the [[Dormition]] is notable as a single hymn that includes passages in all eight tones of the Byzantine [[Octoechos]].<ref>John Sanidopoulos, [https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/08/the-unique-eight-toned-hymn-of.html The Unique Eight Toned Hymn of the Dormition of the Theotokos], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\n===Other sets of 24 pieces===\nNot all sets of 24 pieces belong in this category. For example, there was no intention in [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] for solo violin, [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|24 Pr\u00e9ludes]] for piano, or Pavel Zemek Novak's 24&nbsp;Preludes and Fugues for piano<ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Pavel-Zemek-Nov%C3%A1k/Composer/193094-1 ArkivMusic]. Retrieved 10 April 2013</ref> to cover all the keys. (Paganini may not have been aware of [[Pierre Rode]]'s [[24 Caprices for Violin (Rode)|24 Caprices for violin]], which did span the 24 keys and were written almost as the same time as Paganini's.)\n\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[\u00c9tudes (Chopin)|24 \u00c9tudes, Opp. 10 & 25]] might have originally been planned to be in all 24 keys. In fact, apart from Nos. 7 and 8, the first series (Op. 10) is made of couples of \u00e9tudes in a major key and its parallel minor (the major key either preceding the minor key or following it) with none of the tonalities occurring twice (except for C major, which appears in No. 1 and then in the only couple which is not major-minor, i.e. Nos. 7 and 8). But in the second series (Op. 25) this tonal scheme gets more and more loose. It is still possible to see connections on a tonal basis between the couples of \u00e9tudes in Op. 25, but they are not based on one principle (e.g. Nos. 3 and 4 in F major \u2013 A minor, two tonalities which Chopin likes to put together very often, as in his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|second ''Ballade'']]).\n\nOne might suppose that Chopin considered writing the \u00e9tudes in all the tonalities but eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical and turned back to it later, for the [[Preludes (Chopin)|24 Preludes, Op. 28]]. The fact that the first \u00e9tude of Op. 10 is made of [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] in C major draws a connection to Bach's first book of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and makes it clear that Chopin had the tradition on his mind.{{or|date=August 2018}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Bach and his precursors===\n{{See also|The Well-Tempered Clavier#Precursors}}\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', two complete sets of 24 Preludes and Fugues written for keyboard in 1722 and 1742, and often known as \"the 48\", is generally considered the greatest example of music traversing all 24 keys. Many later composers clearly modelled their sets on Bach's, including the order of the keys.\n\nIt was long believed that Bach had taken the title ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' from a similarly-named set of 24 Preludes and Fugues in all the keys, for which a manuscript dated 1689 was found in the library of the [[Brussels Conservatoire]]. It was later shown that this was the work of a composer who was not even born by 1689: Bernhard Christian Weber (1712\u20131758).

This gives 24 possible keys, but each note can be represented by several [[enharmonic]] note names (note names which designate the same actual note in the 12 note octave such as G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}}) and so each key can be represented by several enharmonic key names (e.g. G{{music|sharp}} minor and A{{music|flat}} minor.\n\nIn practice, the choice of key name is restricted to the 30 keys whose signatures have no double flats or double sharps. (Such key signatures are used for so-called [[theoretical key]]s which are almost never encountered outside music-theoretical exercises.){{efn|In extremely rare cases, theoretical keys do appear with their double-accidental key signatures in real music: an example is [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', which ends in [[G-sharp major]] with F{{music|x}} in the key signature.<ref>http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/14652</ref> However, no set of pieces in all 24 keys that includes a theoretical key is known.}} Keys with 6 flats and 6 sharps,{{efn|G{{music|flat}} major and F{{music|sharp}} major, E{{music|flat}} minor and D{{music|sharp}} minor}} with 7 flats and 5 sharps{{efn|C{{music|flat}} major and B major, A{{music|flat}} minor and G{{music|sharp}} minor}} and with 5 flats and 7 sharps{{efn|D{{music|flat}} major and C{{music|sharp}} major, B{{music|flat}} minor and A{{music|sharp}} minor}} are enharmonic to one another. Composers will, in most (though not all) cases, choose only one key from each enharmonic pair. But there are also cases of sets covering all 30 keys, which, in other words, include all enharmonic variants.\n\nThe table below outlines the choices made in the various collections listed here. The keys are in the order that J.S. Bach used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!\n!'''Key'''\n!'''Key signature'''\n!'''Comments'''\n|-\n| 1\n| [[C major]]\n| No&nbsp;[[sharp (music)|sharps]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[flat (music)|flats]]\n|\n|-\n| 2\n| [[C minor]]\n| 3 flats\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3\n| Either [[C-sharp major|C{{music|sharp}} major]]\n| 7 sharps\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]] chose C{{music|sharp}} major, but most composers have preferred D{{music|flat}} major\n|-\n| or [[D-flat major|D{{music|flat}} major]]\n| 5 flats\n|-\n| 4\n| [[C-sharp minor|C{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| 4 sharps\n| <!--But not [[D-flat minor]], which has 6 flats and 1 double flat.-->\n|-\n| 5\n| [[D major]]\n| 2 sharps\n|\n|-\n| 6\n| [[D minor]]\n| 1 flat\n|\n|-\n| 7\n| [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]]\n| 3 flats\n| <!--But not [[D-sharp major]], which has 5 sharps and 2 double sharps.-->\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| Either [[D-sharp minor|D{{music|sharp}} minor]]\n| 6 sharps\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Most composers of sets of 24 pieces have chosen E{{music|flat}} minor over D{{music|sharp}} minor.

While C{{music|flat}} major is sometimes used in compositions (particularly for the [[harp]], which is especially suited to this key), it is not generally considered one of the standard keys because it is enharmonically equivalent to B major. With its tonic note C{{music|flat}} being in fact a white key, and its parallel minor having 10 flats, its usage is generally undesirable. It is very rare for a set of pieces covering all the keys to include a piece in C{{music|flat}} major. C{{music|flat}} major does appear in Campagnoli's and Rinck's works mentioned above, along with A{{music|sharp}} minor, but those collections include both members of all six enharmonically equivalent pairs.<ref>[http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b3/IMSLP132838-WIMA.a8a5-Rinck_Organ_School_5.pdf IMSLP: Rinck, 14 flat preludes, Nos. 53\u201366]</ref>\n|-\n| or [[C-flat major|C{{music|flat}} major]]\n| 7 flats\n|-\n| 24\n| [[B minor]]\n| 2 sharps\n| <!--But not [[C-flat minor]], which has 4 flats and 3 double flats, and is enharmonically the same key as B minor-->\n|-\n|}\n\n===Order of keys in published works===\nThe [[circle of fifths]], whereby each major key is followed by its [[relative key|relative minor]] key, is a commonly used schema. [[Angelo Michele Bartolotti]] used this approach as early as 1640, and it was also adopted by such later composers as [[Pierre Rode|Rode]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Stephen Heller|Heller]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Dmitry Kabalevsky|Kabalevsky]] and [[Nikolai Kapustin|Kapustin]].\n\nIn [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' and some other earlier sets, major keys were followed by their [[parallel key|parallel minor]] keys. The Bach order was adopted by [[Anton Arensky|Arensky]], [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re|Gli\u00e8re]], [[York Bowen]] and others. \n\nOther composers derived their own schemas based on certain logical rationales. For example, in [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]]\u2019s 25 Preludes, Op. 31, the sequence of keys moves alternately up a fourth and down a third. \n\nYet others used no systematic ordering. [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]], [[Selim Palmgren|Palmgren]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco|Castelnuovo-Tedesco]]'s works are examples of this.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.schickele.com/shoppe/pdqrec/short.htm ''The Short-Tempered Clavier: Preludes and Fugues in all the Major and Minor Keys Except for the Really Hard Ones'', S. easy as 3.14159265 (P.D.Q.
