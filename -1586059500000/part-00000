Second, in the book entitled ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' (1979), [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]], stated that the following four ''prima facie'' principles lie at the core of moral reasoning in health care: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. In the opinion of Beauchamp and Childress, these four principles are part of a \"common morality\"; an approach that \"takes its basic premises directly from the morality shared by the members of society \u2013 that is, unphilosophical common sense and tradition\".<ref>Beauchamp, T.

Whilst Beauchamp and Childress<ref name=\"auto\">Beauchamp, T. L. and Childress, J. F. (2001) ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'', 5th ed., New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> claim that these principles are commonly understood and accepted within society, and thus have a broad degree of support, they also assert that they are drawn from two normative ethical traditions: the duty-based moral philosophy (deontological approach) of [[Immanuel Kant]] and the outcome-based (consequentialist) ethics of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].\n\n==The four principles==\n\nThese ethical principles can be elucidated in slightly different ways, but the explanations provided by Beauchamp and Childress <ref name=\"auto\"/> can be summarised as follows:\n\n'''Respect for autonomy'''\nThis principle refers to the capacity of an individual to be self-determining and to make decisions for themselves without undue pressure, coercion or other forms of persuasion. It is contrasted with the notion of paternalism which occurs when actions of a health care practitioner override or do not seek to respect the wishes of the patient, believing that they are better able to decide what is in the patient's best interests. Whether or not the doctor knows best, s/he has no right to make important decisions on behalf of competent patients, as a general principle. Even where the doctor acts in the patient's interests, it is important that the patient's own choices and wishes be respected.\n\nRespect for autonomy is operationalised through the requirement for [[informed consent]] whereby people who have the capacity for self-determination must be fully informed before being asked for their consent.\n\n'''Beneficence'''\nThis principle describes an obligation to act for the benefit of others. Acting in this way might involve preventing or removing harm, or it might involve the active promotion of some good (health, for example). The aim of beneficent action is to produce the \u2018best\u2019 one can out of a range of possibilities. It can involve cost/benefit analysis such that the \u2018best\u2019 here will be the possible action in which the benefits produced maximally outweigh the costs or the risks. Put simply, it is to act always in the best interests of the patient.\n\n'''Non-maleficence'''\nDuties of non-maleficence require us to refrain from causing deliberate harm or intentional avoidance of actions that might be expected to cause harm. Generally, obligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than obligations of beneficence, but again a cost/benefit analysis may need to be undertaken to identify the best possible action. In some situations harm may be unavoidable and then we must be sure that the benefits outweigh the harm.\n\n'''Justice'''\nThe principle of justice requires that we do what we can to ensure that costs and benefits are fairly distributed. It is possible to obey the principle of non-maleficence and the\nprinciple of beneficence, yet still not behave in an ethical manner, for these two principles say nothing about how benefits should be apportioned. In a given case it may well be that we can only procure a major benefit for some people by slightly harming the interests of others. The principle of beneficence may say we should go ahead, but then the benefits and costs would be unfairly distributed.\n\n==Principlism as a practical approach==\n\nPrinciplism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n\n== Principlism as a matter of debate ==\nPrinciplism has been subjected to challenges since first introduced by Beauchamp and Childress in 1979. The term \"principlism\" itself was first presented, not by Beauchamp and Childress, but by two of the most vocal critics, Danner Clouser and [[Bernard Gert]]. Clouser and Gert assert that the principled approach lacks theoretical unity; the principles lack any systematic relationship because they are drawn from conflicting moral theories, and hence often lead to conflicting conclusions.<ref>Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1990) 'A critique of principlism', ''Journal of Medicine and Philosophy'', 15(2), 219\u2013236. Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1994) Morality vs. principlism, New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref><br />\nThe apparent \"pick and mix\" selection of certain theories and principles, without an underlying theoretical basis, is a cause of great concern for Clouser who states:\n<blockquote>It is a kind of relativism espoused (perhaps unwittingly) by many books (usually anthologies) of bioethics. They parade before the reader a variety of \"theories\" of ethics\u2014Kantianism, deontology, utilitarianism, other forms of consequentialism, and the like\u2014and say, in effect, choose whichever of the competing theories, maxims, principles, or rules suits you for any particular case. Just take your choice! They each have flaws\u2014which are always pointed out\u2014but on balance, the authors seem to be saying, they are probably all equally good!'' <ref>Clouser, K. D. (1995) \"Common Morality as an Alternative to Principlism\", ''Kennedy. Inst. Ethics J.'', 5(3), 219\u2013236, p 224.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOthers have objected to the choice or limitations of the particular principles, such as Herissone-Kelly <ref>Herissone-Kelly, P. (2003) \"The principlist approach to bioethics and its stormy journey overseas\", in H\u00e4yry, M. and Takala, T. eds. ''Scratching the surface of bioethics'', New York: Rodopi, 65\u201377.</ref> who questions the argument that Beauchamp and Childress present in support of their global applicability, and Walker <ref>Walker, T. (2009) \"What principlism misses\", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 35(4), 229\u2013231.</ref>, who believes that more principles need to be added if they are truly to represent a common sense morality. Additionally, it has been suggested, that application of a principlist approach serves to exclude the moral agent, who performs the act, from the moral judgements; in order to see what is good and not merely what are the rights involved, we must consider the virtue and intentions of the person acting.<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1988) ''After Virtue'', 1984., ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'', Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> For example, H\u00e4yry, in his scrutiny of the objection that the \"Georgetown principles\" are not truly representative of European values (being more aligned with Americam liberalism), points to the lack of representation of virtue ethics within their chosen principles: \"By ignoring moral (and religious) virtues, and thereby all deliberations about the ideal nature of a good, virtuous human being, Beauchamp and Childress left their views wide open to accusations of short-sighted hedonism; excessive individualism and sneaking nihilism.\"<ref>H\u00e4yry, M. (2003) \"European values in bioethics: why, what, and how to be used?\", ''Theoretical Medicine And Bioethics'', 24(3), 199\u2013214, p.201.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are also staunch supporters of principlism such as [[Raanan Gillon]] who has claimed that the four principles can explain and justify all the substantive moral claims in medical ethics. According to Gillon, these principles provide a transcultural, transnational, transreligious, and transphilosophical framework for ethical analysis.<ref>Gillon, R. (1994) ''Principles of Health Care Ethics'', New-Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref><ref>Gillon, R. (1998) \"Bioethics overview\", ''Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics'', 1, 305\u2013317.</ref><ref>Gillon, R. (2003) \"Ethics needs principles\u2014four can encompass the rest\u2014and respect for autonomy should be 'first among equals'\", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 29(5), 307\u2013312.</ref>\n\nIn spite of any shortcomings of the principlist approach in bioethical analysis, the perceived benefits have been significant as evidenced by its pervasive use. Principlism is by far the most dominant approach to ethical analysis in healthcare and the book Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress remains the most influential book in modern bioethics.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:Medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Autonomy]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Professional ethics]]\n", "text_old": "'''Principlism''' is an [[applied ethics]] approach to the examination of moral dilemmas that is based upon the application of certain ethical principles.

Scratching the surface of bioethics, New York : Rodopi, 65-77.</ref> who questions the argument that Beauchamp and Childress present in support of their global applicability, and Walker <ref>Walker, T. (2009) 'What principlism misses', Journal of Medical Ethics, 35(4), 229- 231.</ref>, who believes that more principles need to be added if they are truly to represent a common sense morality. Additionally, it has been suggested, that application of a principlist approach serves to exclude the moral agent, who performs the act, from the moral judgements; in order to see what is good and not merely what are the rights involved, we must consider the virtue and intentions of the person acting.<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1988) After Virtue, 1984., Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> For example, H\u00e4yry, in his scrutiny of the objection that the \u2018Georgetown principles\u2019 are not truly representative of European values (being more aligned with Americam liberalism), points to the lack of representation of virtue ethics within their chosen principles: \u2018''By ignoring moral (and religious) virtues, and thereby all deliberations about the ideal nature of a good, virtuous human being, Beauchamp and Childress left their views wide open to accusations of short-sighted hedonism; excessive individualism and sneaking nihilism''\u2019.<ref>H\u00e4yry, M. (2003) 'European values in bioethics: why, what, and how to be used?', Theoretical Medicine And Bioethics, 24(3), 199-214, p.201.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are also staunch supporters of principlism such as [[Raanan Gillon]] who has claimed that the four principles can explain and justify all the substantive moral claims in medical ethics. According to Gillon, these principles provide a transcultural, transnational, transreligious, and transphilosophical framework for ethical analysis.<ref>Gillon, R. (1994) Principles of health care ethics, New-Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (1998) 'Bioethics overview', Encyclopedia of applied ethics, 1, 305-317.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (2003) 'Ethics needs principles\u2014four can encompass the rest\u2014and respect for autonomy should be \u2018first among equals\u2019', Journal of Medical Ethics, 29(5), 307-312.</ref> \n\nIn spite of any shortcomings of the principlist approach in bioethical analysis, the perceived benefits have been significant as evidenced by its pervasive use. Principlism is by far the most dominant approach to ethical analysis in healthcare and the book Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress remains the most influential book in modern bioethics.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:Medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Autonomy]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Professional ethics]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrinciplism as a matter of debate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principlism"}

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge.

The collective effect of all solar variations within the Sun's gravitational field is referred to as [[space weather]]. A major weather component is the [[solar wind]], a stream of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] released from the Sun's upper atmosphere. It is responsible for the [[aurora]], natural light displays in the sky in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]. Space weather disturbances can cause [[List of solar storms|solar storms]] on Earth, disrupting communications, as well as [[geomagnetic storm]]s in Earth's [[magnetosphere]] and [[sudden ionospheric disturbance]]s in the [[ionosphere]]. Variations in solar intensity also affect Earth's climate. These variations can explain events such as ice ages and the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], while the Sun's future expansion into a [[red giant]] will likely end life on Earth.\n\nSolar activity and related events have been recorded since the 8th century BCE.

Solar [[spectroscopy]] began in the 1800s, from which properties of the solar atmosphere could be determined, while the creation of [[daguerreotypy]] led to the first solar photographs on 2 April 1845. Photography assisted in the study of solar prominences, granulation and spectroscopy. Early in the 20th century, interest in [[astrophysics]] surged in America. A number of new observatories were built with solar telescopes around the world.

The collective effect of all solar variations within the Sun's gravitational field is referred to as [[space weather]]. A major weather component is the [[solar wind]], a stream of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] released from the Sun's upper atmosphere. It is responsible for the [[aurora]], natural light displays in the sky in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]].

Iloilo occupies a major southeast portion of the [[Visayas|Visayan island]] of [[Panay]] and is bordered by the province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nJust off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of [[Guimaras]], once part of Iloilo but now an independent province. Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is [[Negros Occidental]], occupying the northwestern half of the larger [[Negros (Philippines)|island of Negros]]. [[Iloilo City]], its capital, ''\"the Queen City of the South'' is geographically located in the province but remains politically independent from the provincial government. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is {{PH wikidata|population_total}}. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,361,042 in total.\n\n==History==\n{{See also | Maragtas | Kedatuan of Madja-as\n | Philippines#Early_historic_coastal_city-states_and_polities| label 3 = Early historic coastal city-states and polities of Philippines | Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities | Greater India | Indosphere}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spanish conquest]], writing was a new import and the use of organic medium such as leaf and bamboo, and no pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo exist today. Oral history, in the form of recited epics, has survived to a small degree, with a few recordings made from the last known surviving [[binukot]]s. But from these oral history and from writings from other sources, one can still glean Iloilo's ancient pre-colonial past.\n\nThe controversial origins of the people of Iloilo is said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be from the state of [[Pannai]], a nation occupying Sumatra. Pannai was a militant nation allied under the empire-mandala of the [[Srivijaya]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]]. The small kingdom repulsed any unlicensed Chinese, Indian or Arab navies that often warred in or pirated the straits of Malacca and for a small nation, they were adept at taking down armadas larger than itself. They were successful in policing and defending the straights of Malacca for the Srivijaya until the [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] occurred, where in a surprise attack from behind, originating from the occupied capital, rendered the militant-state of [[Pannai]] vulnerable from an unprotected assault from the back flank. The Chola invaders eventually destroyed the state of Pannai and its surviving soldiers, royals and scholars were said to have been secreted-out eastwards. The high-borne scholars, soldiers and nobles of Pannai, \"fled to other islands.\" <ref>Francisco Colin, S.J.; Madrid, published in 1663 , from his Labor evang\u00e9lica</ref>\n\nAt this juncture, Iloilo came into prominence, when the local settlement called Irong-Irong and was founded by Datu Paiburong, who presumably fled the fallen Srivijaya Empire after he and his fellows within the new mandala of [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], bought the island of [[Panay]] (Which they presumably named after the state of [[Pannai]] or the shortening of the Ati word, Ananipay) from Marikudo, the chieftain of the [[Ati people]]. The Kedatuan of Madja-as eventually grew a powerful and strong naval presence that it rivaled the nearby states of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] when it came to wealth and prestige.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align        = left\n| width    = 160\n| image1   = Visayans_3.png\n| alt1     = \n| caption1 = \n| image2   = Visayans_4.png\n| alt2     = \n| caption2 = \n| footer   = '''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating an ancient ''kadatuan'' or [[tumao]] of the [[Visayan]]s of Panay wearing the distinctive colors of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Nobility|noble]] couple and ['''2'''] a [[Royal family|royal]] couple. The wealth and prestige of these Visayans from Panay are clearly demonstrated vis-a-vis their [[loincloth]]-wearing Cebuano neighbors which the Spaniards called \"Pintados\" or \"Tattooed Ones\"\n| footer_align = left\n}}\n\nBy 1512, this state had grown so powerful militarily and economically, their naval power regularly threatened Chinese imperial shipping. So much so, that the Chuan-chou gazeeter specifically reported that the Pi-she-yah (Bisaya) (Another term for people from Iloilo) consistently made devastating raids against the Empire's commerce<ref>Chuan-chou Fu-chi (Ch.10) Year 1512</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of [[Panay]] when Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] moved his headquarters from the island of [[Cebu]] and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in [[Oton|Ogtong]] in 1566. This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] and the [[Moro people|Moro]], of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter. The Bisaya accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros. To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the [[Castille War]] against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]]. In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]], because of frequent coastal raids by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] privateers. Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two [[Moro people|Moro]]s named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now [[Iloilo City]] and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009183141/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref> Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan Garc\u00eda de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle.<ref>''Philippines: A Unique Nation'' By Dr. Sonia  M.

Consecrated 1891, destroyed by earthquake 24. Jan. 1948.]] \nSoon, the area itself began to prosper, due to its successful textile and sugar industry. As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and [[Latinos]] from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations). And over time Iloilo grew to be the most important province outside Manila. The City of Iloilo by virtue of a Royal Decree of 1896 was given the honor of having a coat of arms with the Inscription: \"''La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad de Iloilo'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City) in reward for its loyalty to Spain during the Philippine uprising.\n\nDuring the American period, Iloilo then became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the nation. Nevertheless, Iloilo experienced a fall from grace after undergoing severe devastation during [[World War II]], followed by a decline during the 1950s to the 1990s. In part due to the great Iloilo fire which ruined the provincial economy and the slow death of the sugar and textile industries that eventually some prominent families (Iloilo then, had the highest concentration of millionaires outside Manila), as well as the provincial bourgeoisie, abandoned the city to go to other areas such as [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Mindanao]] and [[Metro Manila]]. Still, the large middle-class populace of Iloilo and its agri-business sector has managed to maintain both province and city, despite the exodus of some of its prominent families.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph fil iloilo.png|thumb|upright=0.75]]\n\nThe province covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central and eastern section of [[Panay]] island in the [[Western Visayas]] region.

Spanish is strictly a local language, at least in a historical way with the number of natural Spanish speakers strongly declining after WWII, and due to this, there are today many Ilonggos who do not consider it a local language.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments in Hiligaynon at Molo Church, Iloilo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ten Commandments in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], the predominant language of [[Panay]]]]\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Languages Spoken (2000)<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/content/over-one-and-half-million-persons-iloilo Table 5.

It is also spoken in the neighboring provinces, such as [[Capiz]], [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklan]], [[Masbate]], [[Palawan]] and [[Romblon]] as well as in some parts of [[Maguindanao]]. It is also spoken as a second language by [[Cebuano language|Cebuano speakers]] in [[Negros Oriental]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a speakers]] in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon speakers]] in [[Aklan]], and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon speakers]] in [[Capiz]].\n\nThe language is referred to as ''Ilonggo'' in Iloilo and [[Negros Occidental]]. More precisely, Ilonggo is an ethno-linguistic group referring to the people living in southeastern [[Panay]] and its associated culture. The boundaries of the language called Ilonggo and that called Hiligaynon are unclear. The disagreement of which name is correct extends to [[Philippine languages|Philippine language]] specialists and native laypeople.\n\n===Religion===\nIloilo is Catholic predominated province comprising about 60%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Protestant churches also exist such as members of [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church with 35%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Adventist, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormon) and Jehovah's Witnesses while non Christians are usually represented by Muslims, and to a lesser extent, Buddhists and Hindus.\n\n==Culture==\nSpanish architecture can be seen in old buildings in downtown Iloilo. Ancient [[Indonesians]], [[Malaysians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and later the [[People of India|Indian]], [[Arab people|Arab]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were already trading with the Ilonggos, long before the arrival of the Mexicans, Spaniards and other Europeans. The ruling Spanish government encouraged these foreign merchants to trade in Iloilo but they were not given privileges like ownership of land. Foreign merchants and Spaniards intermarried with the locals, and the Mestizo class was eventually born from their union.  The Mestizo offspring of the local nobilities later emerged as the ruling class of the Ilonggos (see [[Principal\u00eda]]).\n\nThe town's fiesta is one of the most important events for Ilonggos. Almost every town (municipality) in Iloilo has a fiesta and festival celebrated annually.\n\nIloilo is also home to two of the nation's cultural minorities the Sulod-Bukidnon and the Ati.\n\n==Government==\n* [[Governor of Iloilo |Governor]]: [[Arthur Defensor Jr. |Arthur R.

Iloilo}}; {{lang-krj|Kapuoran kang Iloilo}}) is a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] located in the [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of [[Western Visayas]] in the [[Philippines]]. Iloilo occupies a major southeast portion of the [[Visayas|Visayan island]] of [[Panay]] and is bordered by the province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nJust off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of [[Guimaras]], once part of Iloilo but now an independent province. Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is [[Negros Occidental]], occupying the northwestern half of the larger [[Negros (Philippines)|island of Negros]]. [[Iloilo City]], its capital, is geographically located in the province but remains politically independent from the provincial government. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is {{PH wikidata|population_total}}. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,361,042 in total.\n\n==History==\n{{See also | Maragtas | Kedatuan of Madja-as\n | Philippines#Early_historic_coastal_city-states_and_polities| label 3 = Early historic coastal city-states and polities of Philippines | Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities | Greater India | Indosphere}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spanish conquest]], writing was a new import and the use of organic medium such as leaf and bamboo, and no pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo exist today. Oral history, in the form of recited epics, has survived to a small degree, with a few recordings made from the last known surviving [[binukot]]s. But from these oral history and from writings from other sources, one can still glean Iloilo's ancient pre-colonial past.\n\nThe controversial origins of the people of Iloilo is said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be from the state of [[Pannai]], a nation occupying Sumatra. Pannai was a militant nation allied under the empire-mandala of the [[Srivijaya]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]]. The small kingdom repulsed any unlicensed Chinese, Indian or Arab navies that often warred in or pirated the straits of Malacca and for a small nation, they were adept at taking down armadas larger than itself. They were successful in policing and defending the straights of Malacca for the Srivijaya until the [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] occurred, where in a surprise attack from behind, originating from the occupied capital, rendered the militant-state of [[Pannai]] vulnerable from an unprotected assault from the back flank. The Chola invaders eventually destroyed the state of Pannai and its surviving soldiers, royals and scholars were said to have been secreted-out eastwards. The high-borne scholars, soldiers and nobles of Pannai, \"fled to other islands.\" <ref>Francisco Colin, S.J.; Madrid, published in 1663 , from his Labor evang\u00e9lica</ref>\n\nAt this juncture, Iloilo came into prominence, when the local settlement called Irong-Irong and was founded by Datu Paiburong, who presumably fled the fallen Srivijaya Empire after he and his fellows within the new mandala of [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], bought the island of [[Panay]] (Which they presumably named after the state of [[Pannai]] or the shortening of the Ati word, Ananipay) from Marikudo, the chieftain of the [[Ati people]]. The Kedatuan of Madja-as eventually grew a powerful and strong naval presence that it rivaled the nearby states of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] when it came to wealth and prestige.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align        = left\n| width    = 160\n| image1   = Visayans_3.png\n| alt1     = \n| caption1 = \n| image2   = Visayans_4.png\n| alt2     = \n| caption2 = \n| footer   = '''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating an ancient ''kadatuan'' or [[tumao]] of the [[Visayan]]s of Panay wearing the distinctive colors of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Nobility|noble]] couple and ['''2'''] a [[Royal family|royal]] couple. The wealth and prestige of these Visayans from Panay are clearly demonstrated vis-a-vis their [[loincloth]]-wearing Cebuano neighbors which the Spaniards called \"Pintados\" or \"Tattooed Ones\"\n| footer_align = left\n}}\n\nBy 1512, this state had grown so powerful militarily and economically, their naval power regularly threatened Chinese imperial shipping. So much so, that the Chuan-chou gazeeter specifically reported that the Pi-she-yah (Bisaya) (Another term for people from Iloilo) consistently made devastating raids against the Empire's commerce<ref>Chuan-chou Fu-chi (Ch.10) Year 1512</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of [[Panay]] when Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] moved his headquarters from the island of [[Cebu]] and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in [[Oton|Ogtong]] in 1566. This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] and the [[Moro people|Moro]], of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter. The Bisaya accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros. To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the [[Castille War]] against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]]. In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]], because of frequent coastal raids by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] privateers. Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two [[Moro people|Moro]]s named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now [[Iloilo City]] and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009183141/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref> Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan Garc\u00eda de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle.<ref>''Philippines: A Unique Nation'' By Dr. Sonia  M.

Consecrated 1891, destroyed by earthquake 24. Jan. 1948.]] \nSoon, the area itself began to prosper, due to its successful textile and sugar industry. As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and [[Latinos]] from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations). And over time Iloilo grew to be the most important province outside Manila. The City of Iloilo by virtue of a Royal Decree of 1896 was given the honor of having a coat of arms with the Inscription: \"''La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad de Iloilo'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City) in reward for its loyalty to Spain during the Philippine uprising.\n\nDuring the American period, Iloilo then became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the nation. Nevertheless, Iloilo experienced a fall from grace after undergoing severe devastation during [[World War II]], followed by a decline during the 1950s to the 1990s. In part due to the great Iloilo fire which ruined the provincial economy and the slow death of the sugar and textile industries that eventually some prominent families (Iloilo then, had the highest concentration of millionaires outside Manila), as well as the provincial bourgeoisie, abandoned the city to go to other areas such as [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Mindanao]] and [[Metro Manila]]. Still, the large middle-class populace of Iloilo and its agri-business sector has managed to maintain both province and city, despite the exodus of some of its prominent families.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph fil iloilo.png|thumb|upright=0.75]]\n\nThe province covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central and eastern section of [[Panay]] island in the [[Western Visayas]] region. If Iloilo City is included for geographical purposes, Iloilo has an area of {{Convert|5079.17|km2}}. The province is bordered by [[Antique (province)|province of Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Visayan Sea]] and [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nThe province is divided into two distinct geographic regions; the highlands of the [[Central Panay Mountain Range]] on the western border and the lowland plains which account for a larger portion of the province. Small islands east of its northernmost tip also dot the [[Visayan Sea]] - of these, [[Pan de Azucar Island (Iloilo)|Pan de Azucar]] and [[Sicogon Island|Sicogon]] are well-known. [[Mount Baloy]] is the highest mountain in Iloilo with an elevation of {{Convert|6261|ft}} above sea level, located on the triple border of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique. Other peaks are [[Mount Llorente]] 4,409&nbsp;ft. (1,344m), [[Mount Sansanan]] 4,219&nbsp;ft. (1,286m), [[Mount Napulak]] 4,095&nbsp;ft. (1,248 m), [[Mount Balabag]] 3,728&nbsp;ft. (1,136m).\n\nExpansive fishponds and mangrove wetlands are found along the coasts and rivers of [[Iloilo City]] and the towns of [[Oton]], [[Leganes]], [[Zarraga]], [[Dumangas]], [[Anilao, Iloilo|Anilao]], [[Banate]], [[Barotac Viejo]], [[Barotac Nuevo]], [[Ajuy, Iloilo|Ajuy]], [[Balasan]] and [[Carles, Iloilo|Carles]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe Province of Iloilo consists of 42 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] (one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component]] and one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|highly urbanized]]).\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and highly urbanized city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

If the highly urbanized [[Iloilo City|city of Iloilo]] is included for statistical purposes, the province's total population is 2,361,042 people, with a density of {{Pop density|2361042|5079.17|km2|mi2|prec=0}}.\n\nPeople from Iloilo are called [[Ilonggo people|Ilonggos]]. There are three local languages used in the province: [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon (Ilonggo)]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]] and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon]]. Hiligaynon and dialects/variants of it are spoken in [[Iloilo City]] and in some towns of the province, especially to the northeast. Spanish is strictly a local language, at least in a historical way with the number of natural Spanish speakers strongly declining after WWII, and due to this, there are today many Ilonggos who do not consider it a local language.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments in Hiligaynon at Molo Church, Iloilo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ten Commandments in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], the predominant language of [[Panay]]]]\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Languages Spoken (2000)<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/content/over-one-and-half-million-persons-iloilo Table 5.

It is also spoken in the neighboring provinces, such as [[Capiz]], [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklan]], [[Masbate]], [[Palawan]] and [[Romblon]] as well as in some parts of [[Maguindanao]]. It is also spoken as a second language by [[Cebuano language|Cebuano speakers]] in [[Negros Oriental]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a speakers]] in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon speakers]] in [[Aklan]], and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon speakers]] in [[Capiz]].\n\nThe language is referred to as ''Ilonggo'' in Iloilo and [[Negros Occidental]]. More precisely, Ilonggo is an ethno-linguistic group referring to the people living in southeastern [[Panay]] and its associated culture. The boundaries of the language called Ilonggo and that called Hiligaynon are unclear. The disagreement of which name is correct extends to [[Philippine languages|Philippine language]] specialists and native laypeople.\n\n===Religion===\nIloilo is Catholic predominated province comprising about 60%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Protestant churches also exist such as members of [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church with 35%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Adventist, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormon) and Jehovah's Witnesses while non Christians are usually represented by Muslims, and to a lesser extent, Buddhists and Hindus.\n\n==Culture==\nSpanish architecture can be seen in old buildings in downtown Iloilo. Ancient [[Indonesians]], [[Malaysians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and later the [[People of India|Indian]], [[Arab people|Arab]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were already trading with the Ilonggos, long before the arrival of the Mexicans, Spaniards and other Europeans. The ruling Spanish government encouraged these foreign merchants to trade in Iloilo but they were not given privileges like ownership of land. Foreign merchants and Spaniards intermarried with the locals, and the Mestizo class was eventually born from their union.  The Mestizo offspring of the local nobilities later emerged as the ruling class of the Ilonggos (see [[Principal\u00eda]]).\n\nThe town's fiesta is one of the most important events for Ilonggos. Almost every town (municipality) in Iloilo has a fiesta and festival celebrated annually.\n\nIloilo is also home to two of the nation's cultural minorities the Sulod-Bukidnon and the Ati.\n\n==Government==\n* [[Governor of Iloilo |Governor]]: [[Arthur Defensor Jr. |Arthur R.

Iloilo's \"economic boom\" made thousands of jobs, and made the province one of the most competitive in the country. Iloilo City is the center for real estate, accommodation, medical centers, education, shopping centers, business centers, IT/BPO centers and many more. Iloilo's northern part consists of a strong fishing industry and a booming tourism industry. It is near the [[Visayan Sea]], which makes that part of province one of the leading areas in fisheries in the nation. The central part is an agri-industrial center producing a wide array of agricultural products such as corn, rice, bananas, pineapples and sugar among others as well as high-end crops in the [[Bucari Area]] in Leon and in the highlands of [[Alimodian]], as well as inland resorts and trekking sites. The sugar industries is centered in Passi City and its neighboring towns like Lambunao, Duenas, San Enrique and Bingawan.
