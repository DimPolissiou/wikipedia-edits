The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it there for a few minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium.

Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is sufficiently intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well.

One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American [[bucket orchid]] (''Coryanthes'' sp.), an [[epiphyte]]. The bucket orchid attracts male [[Euglossini|euglossine bees]] with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.\n\nThe flower is constructed in such a way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid in the bucket, and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a \"[[pollinium]]\" (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it there for a few minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium. It has been suggested that this process involves \"inebriation\" of the bees,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dodson C.H. |author2=Frymire G.P. |title=Natural pollination of orchids |journal=Mo. Bot.

These include: attention to a subject, believing that a person/group is in a state of need, and the specific characteristics of a given situation. An individual must first give his or her attention to a person/group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=S|author2=Slovic, P |title=Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297\u2013306}}</ref> Distractions severely limit the ability to produce strong affective responses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychological Approaches to Pain Management: A Practitioner's Handbook, 2nd edition|last=Turk|first=Dennis|last2=Gatchel|first2=Robert|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572306424|location=New York|pages=265}}</ref> Without distractions, people are able to attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences. Attention facilitates the experience of sympathy, and without giving undivided attention to many situations sympathy cannot be experienced.\n\nThe need of an individual/group is also considered to elicit sympathy. Varying states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) require unique human reactions, ranging from attention to sympathy. A person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. The conditions which sympathy is deemed as an appropriate response are organized into individual differences and situational differences.\n\nThe ways in which people think about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems 'deserving' of aid is more likely to be helped.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\">{{cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=G.|author2=Small, D.

People help others based on maternal/paternal instincts to care for their own children or family when they are in need.\n\nIndividual moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity can also influence the experience of sympathy.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\"/> Individuals experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to produce sympathy.\n\nSpatial proximity, or when a person or group exists close geographically (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country), they will more likely experience sympathy towards each other. Similarly, ''social'' proximity follows the same pattern. Members of certain groups (ex. racial groups) favor people who are also members of groups similar to their own.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\"/> Social proximity is intimately linked  with in-group and out-group status. In-group status, or a person falling within a certain social group, is also integral to the experience of sympathy. Both of these processes are based on the notion that people within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.\n\nNew and emotionally provoking situations also represent an explanation for empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.\n\n==Evolutionary origins==\nThe evolution of sympathy is tied directly into the development of [[social intelligence]]. Social intelligence references a broad range of behaviors, and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dautenhahn|first=Kerstin|title=I Could Be You: The Phenomenological Dimension Of Social Understanding|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|date=1 July 1997|volume=28|issue=5|pages=417\u2013453|doi=10.1080/019697297126074|citeseerx=10.1.1.63.4796}}</ref> Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother-child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics. In other words, empathic emotions were driven by the desire to create relationships that were mutually beneficial and to better understand the emotions of others that could avert danger or stimulate positive outcomes. By working together, there were better results for everyone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Vignemont|first=Frederique|author2=Singer, Tania |title=The empathic brain: how, when and why?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 October 2006|volume=10|issue=10|pages=435\u2013441|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008|pmid=16949331|url=https://jeannicod.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ijn_00169584/file/empathy_TICS.pdf}}</ref> Social order is improved when people are able to provide aid to others when it is a detriment to oneself for the good of the greater society. For example, giving back to the community often leads to personal benefits.\n \nThe conditions necessary to develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, begin with the creation of a small group of socially dependent individuals. Second, the individuals in this community must have a relatively long lifespan in order to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are also associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35\u201357|doi=10.1086/406755|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4e671994e5b0c7aefbecd050e95fdb45272d7e12}}</ref> The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both primate species and in human development.\n\n==Communication==\nVerbal communication is the clearest medium by which individuals are able to communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy would be the appropriate reaction.\n\nNonverbal communication presents a fascinating study of speech intonation, facial expression, bodily motions and person-to-person physical contacts. Some other forms of nonverbal communication include how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture and appearance. These forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (fatigue), and understanding. Emotional expression is especially linked to the production of emotion-specific facial expressions. These expressions are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers' own understanding of the emotion and/or situation.  There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.\n\n[[File:Portret van een man005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Facial expressions can communicate sympathy and other emotions nonverbally.]]\n\nNonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by people observing the gestures, expressions, etc., and not by the person experiencing them first hand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=DePaulo|first=B.

The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.\n\n==Human behavior==\nAlthough sympathy is a well-known term, the implications of sympathy found in the study of human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled \"System 1\" and \"System 2.\" These two systems, representing the gut and the head respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Arthur J.|title=Empathy and Sympathy: Therapeutic Distinctions in Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=95\u2013101|doi=10.17744/mehc.32.2.228n116thw397504}}</ref> It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.\n\nSympathy also helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior (i.e. donations, community service). The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two, different emotion-driven decision making processes. Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determined ''how much'' to donate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=Stephan |author2=Sagara, Namika |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2011|volume=24|issue=4|pages=361\u2013376|doi=10.1002/bdm.697}}</ref> Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need.

The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; this action is seen as self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) will often result in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.\n\n==Healthcare==\nSympathy can also impact the way doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions.

This could be caused by humans' reaction to emotional faces, reflecting the expressions on their own faces, which seems to help people better understand the other person's emotion.

Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from sensation of stimuli in the environment. From the sensory level, people must sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, indicative of the dual-process theory, top-down responses must be enacted to make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes often include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.<ref name=\"Singer 81\u201396\"/>\n\n==Child development==\n[[File:Baby yelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A baby will often cry at the sound of another baby's cries.]]\n\nSympathy is a stepping stone in both social and [[moral development]]. It generally arises between 2\u20133 years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby.<ref name=\"Decety 2010 886\u2013899\"/> This emphasizes the infant's ability to recognize emotional cues in his or her environment, even if not able to fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child rearing is the development of the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways, yet executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Decety and Michalska (2010) believe that early affective development and later development of executive functions create a disparity between how children and young adults experience another person's pain. Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.<ref name='Decety'/>\n\nSympathy can lead to, and be the cause of [[prosocial]] and [[altruistic]] behaviour. Altruistic behaviour is when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person and feel \"other-oriented\" (inclined to help other people in need or distressed.)\nPeople are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If leaving is easy, an individual is likely to reduce one's own distress (of sympathy; feeling bad) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. Sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, showing that humans are \"other oriented\" and altruistic.<ref name=\"Nancy Eisenberg 1989\">Nancy Eisenberg, R. A. (1989). Relation of Sympathy and Personal Distress to Prosocial Behavior: A Multimethod Study.

Parenting styles (specifically level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wisp\u00e9|first=Lauren|title=The distinction between sympathy and empathy: To call forth a concept, a word is needed.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1986|volume=50|issue=2|pages=314\u2013321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.314}}</ref> Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children 1\u20132 years old. Through self-report methods it is difficult to measure emotional responses as they are not as able to report these responses as well as adult.<ref name=\"Nancy Eisenberg 1989\"/> This is representative of an increased efficiency of and ability to engage in internal moral reasoning.\n\n===Theory of mind===\nThe development of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people, is strongly associated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions.<ref name=\"Decety 2010 886\u2013899\"/> These emotions are complex because they involve more than just one's own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people's varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or imagining how another person feels, is integral for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weele|first=Cor|title=Empathy's purity, sympathy's complexities; De Waal, Darwin and Adam Smith|journal=Biology & Philosophy|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=583\u2013593|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9248-4|pmid=21765569|pmc=3106151}}</ref> Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Carlo, Gustavo |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Court, Patricia|title=Prosocial Development in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 August 1995|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1179\u20131197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00930.x}}</ref>\n\n===Innate feature===\nA study conducted in Switzerland in 2006 sought to find whether or not sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development.

The study concluded that children do develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. Furthermore, the study found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. [[Prosocial behavior]] has been noted in children as young as 12 months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. Levels of prosocial behavior increased with sympathy in children with low moral motivation, as it reflects the link between innate abilities and honing them with the guidance of parents and teachers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Superficial sympathy]]\n*[[Altruism]]\n*[[Condolence]]\n*[[Ishin-denshin]], traditional Japanese concept of unspoken mutual understanding, sometimes translated as \"sympathy\"\n*[[Mimpathy]]\n*[[Moral emotions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Decety, J. and Ickes, W.

These include: attention to a subject, believing that a person/group is in a state of need, and the specific characteristics of a given situation. An individual must first give his or her attention to a person/group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=S|author2=Slovic, P |title=Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297\u2013306}}</ref> Distractions severely limit the ability to produce strong affective responses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychological Approaches to Pain Management: A Practitioner's Handbook, 2nd edition|last=Turk|first=Dennis|last2=Gatchel|first2=Robert|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572306424|location=New York|pages=265}}</ref> Without distractions, people are able to attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences. Attention facilitates the experience of sympathy, and without giving undivided attention to many situations sympathy cannot be experienced.\n\nThe need of an individual/group is also considered to elicit sympathy. Varying states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) require unique human reactions, ranging from attention to sympathy. A person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. The conditions which sympathy is deemed as an appropriate response are organized into individual differences and situational differences.\n\nThe ways in which people think about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems 'deserving' of aid is more likely to be helped.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\">{{cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=G.|author2=Small, D.

People help others based on maternal/paternal instincts to care for their own children or family when they are in need.\n\nIndividual moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity can also influence the experience of sympathy.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\"/> Individuals experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to produce sympathy.\n\nSpatial proximity, or when a person or group exists close geographically (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country), they will more likely experience sympathy towards each other. Similarly, ''social'' proximity follows the same pattern. Members of certain groups (ex. racial groups) favor people who are also members of groups similar to their own.<ref name=\"Lowenstein 2007 112\u2013126\"/> Social proximity is intimately linked  with in-group and out-group status. In-group status, or a person falling within a certain social group, is also integral to the experience of sympathy. Both of these processes are based on the notion that people within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.\n\nNew and emotionally provoking situations also represent an explanation for empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.\n\n==Evolutionary origins==\nThe evolution of sympathy is tied directly into the development of [[social intelligence]]. Social intelligence references a broad range of behaviors, and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dautenhahn|first=Kerstin|title=I Could Be You: The Phenomenological Dimension Of Social Understanding|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|date=1 July 1997|volume=28|issue=5|pages=417\u2013453|doi=10.1080/019697297126074|citeseerx=10.1.1.63.4796}}</ref> Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother-child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics.

For example, giving back to the community often leads to personal benefits.\n \nThe conditions necessary to develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, begin with the creation of a small group of socially dependent individuals. Second, the individuals in this community must have a relatively long lifespan in order to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are also associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35\u201357|doi=10.1086/406755|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4e671994e5b0c7aefbecd050e95fdb45272d7e12}}</ref> The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both primate species and in human development.\n\n==Communication==\nVerbal communication is the clearest medium by which individuals are able to communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy would be the appropriate reaction.\n\nNonverbal communication presents a fascinating study of speech intonation, facial expression, bodily motions and person-to-person physical contacts. Some other forms of nonverbal communication include how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture and appearance. These forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (fatigue), and understanding. Emotional expression is especially linked to the production of emotion-specific facial expressions. These expressions are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers' own understanding of the emotion and/or situation.  There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.\n\n[[File:Portret van een man005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Facial expressions can communicate sympathy and other emotions nonverbally.]]\n\nNonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by people observing the gestures, expressions, etc., and not by the person experiencing them first hand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=DePaulo|first=B.

The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.\n\n==Human behavior==\nAlthough sympathy is a well-known term, the implications of sympathy found in the study of human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled \"System 1\" and \"System 2.\" These two systems, representing the gut and the head respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Arthur J.|title=Empathy and Sympathy: Therapeutic Distinctions in Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=95\u2013101|doi=10.17744/mehc.32.2.228n116thw397504}}</ref> It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.\n\nSympathy also helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior (i.e. donations, community service). The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two, different emotion-driven decision making processes. Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determined ''how much'' to donate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=Stephan |author2=Sagara, Namika |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2011|volume=24|issue=4|pages=361\u2013376|doi=10.1002/bdm.697}}</ref> Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need.

The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; this action is seen as self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) will often result in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.\n\n==Healthcare==\nSympathy can also impact the way doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions. Sympathetic tendencies within the health field fall disproportionately based on patient characteristics and disease type.<ref name=\"Etchegary 65\u201384\">{{cite journal|last=Etchegary|first=Holly|title=Stigma and Genetic Risk: Perceptions of Stigma among Those at Risk for Huntington Disease (HD)\u2217|journal=Qualitative Research in Psychology|date=7 August 2007|volume=4|issue=1\u20132|pages=65\u201384|doi=10.1080/14780880701473417}}</ref>  One factor that is frequently considered when determining sympathy is controllability, or the degree to which an individual could have avoided contracting the disease or medical condition.

This could be caused by humans' reaction to emotional faces, reflecting the expressions on their own faces, which seems to help people better understand the other person's emotion. In addition, researchers have also suggested that the neural mechanisms that are activated when personally experiencing emotions are also activated when viewing another person experiencing the same emotions ([[mirror neurons]]).<ref name=\"Singer 81\u201396\">{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Tania|author2=Lamm, Claus |title=The Social Neuroscience of Empathy|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 March 2009|volume=1156|issue=1|pages=81\u201396|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04418.x|pmid=19338504|bibcode=2009NYASA1156...81S}}</ref> Pain seems to specifically activate a region known as the cingulate cortex,{{mcn|date=August 2016}} in addition to activation that is mentioned earlier.  The temporal parietal junction, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum are also thought to play a role in the production of emotion.{{mcn|date=August 2016}}\n\nGenerally, empathic emotions (including sympathy), require the activation of top-down and bottom-up activity. Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from sensation of stimuli in the environment. From the sensory level, people must sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, indicative of the dual-process theory, top-down responses must be enacted to make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes often include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.<ref name=\"Singer 81\u201396\"/>\n\n==Child development==\n[[File:Baby yelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A baby will often cry at the sound of another baby's cries.]]\n\nSympathy is a stepping stone in both social and [[moral development]]. It generally arises between 2\u20133 years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby.<ref name=\"Decety 2010 886\u2013899\"/> This emphasizes the infant's ability to recognize emotional cues in his or her environment, even if not able to fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child rearing is the development of the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways, yet executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Decety and Michalska (2010) believe that early affective development and later development of executive functions create a disparity between how children and young adults experience another person's pain. Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.<ref name='Decety'/>\n\nSympathy can lead to, and be the cause of [[prosocial]] and [[altruistic]] behaviour. Altruistic behaviour is when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person and feel \"other-oriented\" (inclined to help other people in need or distressed.)\nPeople are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If leaving is easy, an individual is likely to reduce one's own distress (of sympathy; feeling bad) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. Sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, showing that humans are \"other oriented\" and altruistic.<ref name=\"Nancy Eisenberg 1989\">Nancy Eisenberg, R. A. (1989). Relation of Sympathy and Personal Distress to Prosocial Behavior: A Multimethod Study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55-64.</ref>\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the use or acceptance of sympathy can be both altruistic and self-satisfying in social situations. Parenting styles (specifically level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wisp\u00e9|first=Lauren|title=The distinction between sympathy and empathy: To call forth a concept, a word is needed.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1986|volume=50|issue=2|pages=314\u2013321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.314}}</ref> Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children 1\u20132 years old. Through self-report methods it is difficult to measure emotional responses as they are not as able to report these responses as well as adult.<ref name=\"Nancy Eisenberg 1989\"/> This is representative of an increased efficiency of and ability to engage in internal moral reasoning.\n\n===Theory of mind===\nThe development of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people, is strongly associated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions.<ref name=\"Decety 2010 886\u2013899\"/> These emotions are complex because they involve more than just one's own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people's varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or imagining how another person feels, is integral for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weele|first=Cor|title=Empathy's purity, sympathy's complexities; De Waal, Darwin and Adam Smith|journal=Biology & Philosophy|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=583\u2013593|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9248-4|pmid=21765569|pmc=3106151}}</ref> Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Carlo, Gustavo |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Court, Patricia|title=Prosocial Development in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 August 1995|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1179\u20131197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00930.x}}</ref>\n\n===Innate feature===\nA study conducted in Switzerland in 2006 sought to find whether or not sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development.

(2009): 442-60.</ref> Over the course of one year, questionnaires were filled out regarding the progress and behavior of each youth. Thereafter, an interview was conducted in the spring of 2007. The study concluded that children do develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. Furthermore, the study found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. [[Prosocial behavior]] has been noted in children as young as 12 months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. Levels of prosocial behavior increased with sympathy in children with low moral motivation, as it reflects the link between innate abilities and honing them with the guidance of parents and teachers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Superficial sympathy]]\n*[[Altruism]]\n*[[Condolence]]\n*[[Ishin-denshin]], traditional Japanese concept of unspoken mutual understanding, sometimes translated as \"sympathy\"\n*[[Mimpathy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Decety, J. and Ickes, W.

The term is less frequently applied to [[film]] music, with such music being referred to instead as the \"[[film score]]\" or \"[[soundtrack]]\".'''\n\nIncidental music is often [[background music]], and is intended to add atmosphere to the action. It may take the form of something as simple as a low, ominous tone suggesting an impending startling event or to enhance the depiction of a story-advancing sequence. It may also include pieces such as [[overture]]s, music played during scene changes, or at the end of an [[act (theater)|act]], immediately preceding an interlude, as was customary with several nineteenth-century plays. It may also be required in plays that have [[musician]]s performing on-stage.\n\nThe use of incidental music dates back at least as far as [[Greek literature|Greek drama]]. A number of [[european classical music|classical]] [[composer]]s have written incidental music for various plays, with the more famous examples including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[Thamos, King of Egypt|''Thamos, King of Egypt'' music]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Egmont (Beethoven)|''Egmont'' music]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s [[Preciosa (Weber)|''Preciosa'' music]], [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Rosamunde|''Rosamunde'' music]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' music]], [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Manfred (Schumann)|''Manfred'' music]], [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (Bizet)|''L'Arl\u00e9sienne'' music]], and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|''Peer Gynt'' music]]. Parts of all of these are often performed in concerts outside the context of the play. Vocal incidental music, which is included in the classical scores mentioned above, should never be confused with the score of a [[Broadway musical|Broadway]] or [[film musical]], in which the songs often reveal character and further the storyline. Since the score of a Broadway or film musical is what actually makes the work a ''musical'', it is far more essential to the work than mere incidental music, which nearly always amounts to little more than a background score; indeed, many plays have no incidental music whatsoever.\n\nSome early examples of what were later called incidental music are also described as [[semi-opera]]s, quasi-operas, [[masque]]s, [[vaudeville]]s and [[melodrama]]s.\n\nThe genre of incidental music does not extend to pieces designed for concert performance, such as overtures named after a play, for example, Beethoven's ''[[Coriolan Overture]]'' (written for [[Heinrich Joseph von Collin]]'s tragedy), or [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' fantasy-overture.\n\nModern composers of incidental music include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], [[Irmin Schmidt]], [[Ilona Sekacz]], [[John White (composer)|John White]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Overture===\n{{main|Overture}}\nAn ''overture'' is incidental music that is played usually at the beginning of a film, play, opera, etc., before the action begins.

He ruled the East Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli]] as a vassal of [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Persia]] from 1716 to 1724. One of the most important and extraordinary statesman of early 18th-century Georgia, he is known as a notable legislator, scholar, critic, translator and poet. His reign was eventually terminated by the [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] invasion following the disintegration of Safavid Persia, which forced Vakhtang into exile in the [[Russian Empire]]. Vakhtang was unable to get the [[tsar]]'s support for his kingdom and instead had to permanently stay with his northern neighbors for his own safety. On his way to a diplomatic mission sanctioned by [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]], he fell ill and died in southern Russia in 1737, never reaching Georgia.\n\n==As a regent==\nSon of Prince [[Levan (son of Vakhtang V)|Levan]], he ruled as regent (''janishin'') for his absent uncle, [[George XI of Kartli|George XI]], and his brother, [[Kaikhosro of Kartli|Kaikhosro]], from 1703 to 1712. During these years, he launched a series of long-needed reforms, revived economy and culture, reorganised administration and attempted to fortify the central royal authority. In 1707\u20131709, he substantially revised the legal code (''dasturlamali'', aka \u201cVakhtang\u2019s code\u201d) which would operate as a basis for the Georgian [[feudal]] system up to the [[Russia]]n annexation. He was summoned by the [[shah]] [[Husayn (Safavid)|Husayn]] in 1712 to be confirmed as [[wali]]/[[List of the Kings of Georgia|king]] of [[Kartli]]. The shah would not grant the confirmation, except on condition of Vakhtang embracing [[Islam]], which having refused to do, he was imprisoned,{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|p=328}} and, after a brief regency of [[Prince Svimon of Kartli|Prince Simon]], his brother [[Jesse of Kartli|Jesse]] (Ali Quli-Khan), who complied with the condition, was put in his place in 1714. Jesse governed Kartli two years, during which he suffered from internal troubles and the inroads of the [[Dagestan]]i tribes, otherwise known as ''[[Lekianoba]]''.\n\nDuring the years of captivity, Vakhtang requested aid from the Christian monarchs of [[Europe]], particularly he sent his uncle and tutor, [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]], on a mission to [[Louis XIV of France]]. Later, in his last letters to the Pope [[Innocent XIII]] and [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] dated 29 November 1722 said Vakhtang that he was since years [[Crypto-Papism|secretly Catholic]], but he could not confess it in publicity \"because of betraying people about me\" and confirmed with it the reports of [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries from Persia. They claimed that Vakhtang became Catholic before he converted outwards to Islam and went there to Catholic mass. Politically went his efforts, however, in vain, and Vakhtang reluctantly converted in 1716, adopting the name of Husayn-Qoli Khan. Appointed ''[[sipah-salar]]''{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} (commander-in-chief) of the [[Persia]]n armies, he also served as ''[[beglerbeg]]'' (governor-general) of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] for some time. He sent his son, [[Bakar of Kartli|Bakar]] to govern Kartli, whereas Jesse, having abjured Islam, had retired.\n\n==His reign==\nVakhtang remained seven years in Persia before he was permitted to return to his kingdom in 1719. He was sent back with the task to put an end to the continual raids by north Caucasian mountain tribes, particularly the [[Lezgian people|Lezgin]] tribes of Dagestan.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} Assisted by the ruler of neighboring Kakheti as well as the beglarbeg of [[Shirvan Beylarbeylik|Shirvan]], Vakhtang made significant progress in putting a halt to the Lezgins.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} At the campaign's climax however, in the winter of 1721, the Persian government recalled him.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} The order, which came after grand vizier [[Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani]]'s fall, was made by the instigation of the eunuch faction within the royal court, having persuaded the shah that a successful end of the campaign for Vakhtang would do the Safavid realm more harm than good; it would enable Vakhtang, the Safavid ''wali'' to form an alliance with Russia with the aim to conquer Iran.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} This terminated Vakhtang's short-lived loyalty to the Shah. He made secret contacts with Tsar [[Peter the Great]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and expressed his support for Russia's future presence in the Caucasus. After several delays, Peter himself led an army of about 25,000 and a substantial fleet along the west coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] in July 1722, initiating the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]].\n\nAt this time, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Persia was internally in chaos and had already been declining for years, with [[Siege of Isfahan|the capital Isfahan besieged]] by rebel [[Afghanistan|Afghans]]. As a Persian vassal and commander, Vakhtang's brother, Rostom, died during the siege and the Shah appointed Vakhtang's son [[Bakar Bagrationi|Bakar]] as commander of the defense. However, Vakhtang refused to come to the relief of Isfahan. At the same time, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] offered him an alliance against Persia, but Vakhtang preferred to await the arrival of the Russians. Peter's promises to provide military support to the Caucasian Christians for final emancipation from the Persian yoke created a great euphoria among the Georgians and [[Armenia]]ns.\n\nIn September, Vakhtang VI encamped at [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] with a combined Georgian-Armenian army of 40,000 to join the advancing Russian expedition. He hoped that Peter would not only seek gains for Russia, but would also protect Georgia from both Persians and Turks.  However, Peter became and returned to Russia. He directed his armies to seize territories along the Caspian, but chose not to confront the Ottomans who were already preparing to claim succession to Safavid rule in the Caucasus. Vakhtang, abandoned by his Russian allies, returned to Tbilisi in November 1722. The Shah got revenge on him by giving a sanction to the Muslim king [[Constantine II of Kakheti]] to take the kingdom of Kartli. In May 1723, Constantine and his Persians marched into Vakhtang's possessions. Vakhtang, after having defended himself for some time at [[Tbilisi]], was finally expelled. Vakhtang fled to [[Shida Kartli|Inner Kartli]], From there he attempted to win support from the advancing Ottoman forces and submitted to the authority of the Sultan; but the Turks, having occupied the country, gave the throne to his brother Jesse, who again became a nominal Muslim.\n\nIn these invasions by Turkey, Persia, Dagestanis and Afghans, three-fourths of the population of Georgia was destroyed. Vakhtang, after having wandered a long time in the mountains with his most faithful adherents, again sought protection from Peter, who invited him to Russia. Accompanied by his family, his close comrades-in-arms, and a retinue of 1,200, he made his way across the Caucasus to Russia in July 1724. Peter had just died, and his successor, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] gave no real help but allowed Vakhtang to settle in Russia, granting him a pension and some estates.\n\nVakhtang resided in Russia till 1734, but in that year he resolved to try to recover his dominions by the co-operation of the Shah of Persia. [[Anna of Russia|Tsarina Anna]] consented to Vakhtang's project, but gave him instructions how to act in Persia, and in what manner he should induce the Georgians and Caucasian highlanders to become Russian vassals, and bring about their entire submission to Russia. Vakhtang started on his diplomatic journey, in company with a Russian general, but fell ill on his way, and died at [[Astrakhan]] on March 26, 1737. He was buried at the city's Church of [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. Many of his followers remained in Russia, and later served in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. A descendant, [[Pyotr Bagration]], was perhaps the most famous of them.\n\n==Scholarly and cultural activities==\n[[File:V6flag.JPG|thumb|Vakhtang VI's royal banner featuring the biblical king [[David]], a reference to a [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratid claim of Davidic origin]].]]\nAlthough Vakhtang's political decisions have sometimes been object of criticism, his scholarly and cultural activities are the crowning merits of his reign. He was, indeed, one of the most learned monarchs of the time. He was an author and organiser of numerous cultural and educational projects aimed at reviving the country's intellectual life. It was him who, with the help of the archbishop of [[Walachia]] [[Anthim the Iberian|Anthim the Georgian]], established, in 1709, the first printing press in Georgia and the whole Caucasus. Among the books published in \"Vakhtang's Printing Press\" in Tbilisi was the 12th-century national epic poem [[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]] (''Vep\u2019khistkaosani'') by [[Shota Rustaveli]], accompanied by scholarly commentaries by the king himself. This induced a new wave of interest towards that great medieval poet and would influence a new generation of Georgian poets of the 18th century, which is generally regarded as the [[Renaissance]] of the Georgian literature.\n\nHe also undertook the printing of the [[Bible]], which had been, as it is believed, translated as early as the fifth century from the Greek into the Georgian, and corrected in the 11th century by the monks of the Georgian convent on [[Mount Athos]]. His printing house printed also the [[Gospels]], the [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], the [[Psalms]], and several liturgies and prayer-books, causing a great discontent at the court of Persia which perceived that the nominally Muslim Vakhtang, instead of following the [[Koran]], promoted Christianity.\n\nAn eminent critic and translator, Vakhtang himself was an author of several patriotic and romantic lyric poems. He is known to have translated an ancient collection of fables [[Kalila and Demna]] from Persian to [[Georgian language]]<ref>https://evergreen.tsu.ge/eg/opac/record/134029?qtype=author;query=%E1%83%A8%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A8%E1%83%98%E1%83%A2%E1%83%90%E1%83%A8%E1%83%95%E1%83%98%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%20%20%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%20</ref>.

He ruled the East Georgian [[Kingdom of Kartli]] as a vassal of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]] from 1716 to 1724. One of the most important and extraordinary statesman of early 18th-century Georgia, he is known as a notable legislator, scholar, critic, translator and poet. His reign was eventually terminated by the [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] invasion following the disintegration of Safavid Persia, which forced Vakhtang into exile in the [[Russian Empire]]. Vakhtang was unable to get the [[tsar]]'s support for his kingdom and instead had to permanently stay with his northern neighbors for his own safety. On his way to a diplomatic mission sanctioned by [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]], he fell ill and died in southern Russia in 1737, never reaching Georgia.\n\n==As a regent==\nSon of Prince [[Levan (son of Vakhtang V)|Levan]], he ruled as regent (''janishin'') for his absent uncle, [[George XI of Kartli|George XI]], and his brother, [[Kaikhosro of Kartli|Kaikhosro]], from 1703 to 1712. During these years, he launched a series of long-needed reforms, revived economy and culture, reorganised administration and attempted to fortify the central royal authority. In 1707\u20131709, he substantially revised the legal code (''dasturlamali'', aka \u201cVakhtang\u2019s code\u201d) which would operate as a basis for the Georgian [[feudal]] system up to the [[Russia]]n annexation. He was summoned by the [[shah]] [[Husayn (Safavid)|Husayn]] in 1712 to be confirmed as [[wali]]/[[List of the Kings of Georgia|king]] of [[Kartli]]. The shah would not grant the confirmation, except on condition of Vakhtang embracing [[Islam]], which having refused to do, he was imprisoned,{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|p=328}} and, after a brief regency of [[Prince Svimon of Kartli|Prince Simon]], his brother [[Jesse of Kartli|Jesse]] (Ali Quli-Khan), who complied with the condition, was put in his place in 1714. Jesse governed Kartli two years, during which he suffered from internal troubles and the inroads of the [[Dagestan]]i tribes, otherwise known as ''[[Lekianoba]]''.\n\nDuring the years of captivity, Vakhtang requested aid from the Christian monarchs of [[Europe]], particularly he sent his uncle and tutor, [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]], on a mission to [[Louis XIV of France]]. Later, in his last letters to the Pope [[Innocent XIII]] and [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] dated 29 November 1722 said Vakhtang that he was since years [[Crypto-Papism|secretly Catholic]], but he could not confess it in publicity \"because of betraying people about me\" and confirmed with it the reports of [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries from Persia. They claimed that Vakhtang became Catholic before he converted outwards to Islam and went there to Catholic mass. Politically went his efforts, however, in vain, and Vakhtang reluctantly converted in 1716, adopting the name of Husayn-Qoli Khan. Appointed ''[[sipah-salar]]''{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} (commander-in-chief) of the [[Persia]]n armies, he also served as ''[[beglerbeg]]'' (governor-general) of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] for some time. He sent his son, [[Bakar of Kartli|Bakar]] to govern Kartli, whereas Jesse, having abjured Islam, had retired.\n\n==His reign==\nVakhtang remained seven years in Persia before he was permitted to return to his kingdom in 1719. He was sent back with the task to put an end to the continual raids by north Caucasian mountain tribes, particularly the [[Lezgian people|Lezgin]] tribes of Dagestan.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} Assisted by the ruler of neighboring Kakheti as well as the beglarbeg of [[Shirvan Beylarbeylik|Shirvan]], Vakhtang made significant progress in putting a halt to the Lezgins.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} At the campaign's climax however, in the winter of 1721, the Persian government recalled him.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} The order, which came after grand vizier [[Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani]]'s fall, was made by the instigation of the eunuch faction within the royal court, having persuaded the shah that a successful end of the campaign for Vakhtang would do the Safavid realm more harm than good; it would enable Vakhtang, the Safavid ''wali'' to form an alliance with Russia with the aim to conquer Iran.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} This terminated Vakhtang's short-lived loyalty to the Shah. He made secret contacts with Tsar [[Peter the Great]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and expressed his support for Russia's future presence in the Caucasus. After several delays, Peter himself led an army of about 25,000 and a substantial fleet along the west coast of the [[Caspian Sea]] in July 1722, initiating the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]].\n\nAt this time, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Persia was internally in chaos and had already been declining for years, with [[Siege of Isfahan|the capital Isfahan besieged]] by rebel [[Afghanistan|Afghans]]. As a Persian vassal and commander, Vakhtang's brother, Rostom, died during the siege and the Shah appointed Vakhtang's son [[Bakar Bagrationi|Bakar]] as commander of the defense. However, Vakhtang refused to come to the relief of Isfahan. At the same time, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] offered him an alliance against Persia, but Vakhtang preferred to await the arrival of the Russians. Peter's promises to provide military support to the Caucasian Christians for final emancipation from the Persian yoke created a great euphoria among the Georgians and [[Armenia]]ns.\n\nIn September, Vakhtang VI encamped at [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] with a combined Georgian-Armenian army of 40,000 to join the advancing Russian expedition. He hoped that Peter would not only seek gains for Russia, but would also protect Georgia from both Persians and Turks.  However, Peter became and returned to Russia. He directed his armies to seize territories along the Caspian, but chose not to confront the Ottomans who were already preparing to claim succession to Safavid rule in the Caucasus. Vakhtang, abandoned by his Russian allies, returned to Tbilisi in November 1722. The Shah got revenge on him by giving a sanction to the Muslim king [[Constantine II of Kakheti]] to take the kingdom of Kartli. In May 1723, Constantine and his Persians marched into Vakhtang's possessions. Vakhtang, after having defended himself for some time at [[Tbilisi]], was finally expelled. Vakhtang fled to [[Shida Kartli|Inner Kartli]], From there he attempted to win support from the advancing Ottoman forces and submitted to the authority of the Sultan; but the Turks, having occupied the country, gave the throne to his brother Jesse, who again became a nominal Muslim.\n\nIn these invasions by Turkey, Persia, Dagestanis and Afghans, three-fourths of the population of Georgia was destroyed. Vakhtang, after having wandered a long time in the mountains with his most faithful adherents, again sought protection from Peter, who invited him to Russia. Accompanied by his family, his close comrades-in-arms, and a retinue of 1,200, he made his way across the Caucasus to Russia in July 1724. Peter had just died, and his successor, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] gave no real help but allowed Vakhtang to settle in Russia, granting him a pension and some estates.\n\nVakhtang resided in Russia till 1734, but in that year he resolved to try to recover his dominions by the co-operation of the Shah of Persia. [[Anna of Russia|Tsarina Anna]] consented to Vakhtang's project, but gave him instructions how to act in Persia, and in what manner he should induce the Georgians and Caucasian highlanders to become Russian vassals, and bring about their entire submission to Russia. Vakhtang started on his diplomatic journey, in company with a Russian general, but fell ill on his way, and died at [[Astrakhan]] on March 26, 1737. He was buried at the city's Church of [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. Many of his followers remained in Russia, and later served in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. A descendant, [[Pyotr Bagration]], was perhaps the most famous of them.\n\n==Scholarly and cultural activities==\n[[File:V6flag.JPG|thumb|Vakhtang VI's royal banner featuring the biblical king [[David]], a reference to a [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratid claim of Davidic origin]].]]\nAlthough Vakhtang's political decisions have sometimes been object of criticism, his scholarly and cultural activities are the crowning merits of his reign. He was, indeed, one of the most learned monarchs of the time. He was an author and organiser of numerous cultural and educational projects aimed at reviving the country's intellectual life. It was him who, with the help of the archbishop of [[Walachia]] [[Anthim the Iberian|Anthim the Georgian]], established, in 1709, the first printing press in Georgia and the whole Caucasus. Among the books published in \"Vakhtang's Printing Press\" in Tbilisi was the 12th-century national epic poem [[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]] (''Vep\u2019khistkaosani'') by [[Shota Rustaveli]], accompanied by scholarly commentaries by the king himself. This induced a new wave of interest towards that great medieval poet and would influence a new generation of Georgian poets of the 18th century, which is generally regarded as the [[Renaissance]] of the Georgian literature.\n\nHe also undertook the printing of the [[Bible]], which had been, as it is believed, translated as early as the fifth century from the Greek into the Georgian, and corrected in the 11th century by the monks of the Georgian convent on [[Mount Athos]]. His printing house printed also the [[Gospels]], the [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], the [[Psalms]], and several liturgies and prayer-books, causing a great discontent at the court of Persia which perceived that the nominally Muslim Vakhtang, instead of following the [[Koran]], promoted Christianity.\n\nAn eminent critic and translator, Vakhtang himself was an author of several patriotic and romantic lyric poems. He is known to have translated an ancient collection of fables [[Kalila and Demna]] from Persian to [[Georgian language]]<ref>https://evergreen.tsu.ge/eg/opac/record/134029?qtype=author;query=%E1%83%A8%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A8%E1%83%98%E1%83%A2%E1%83%90%E1%83%A8%E1%83%95%E1%83%98%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%20%20%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%20</ref>. The translation was later finalized and edited by the King's mentor, [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]] <ref>https://atsu.edu.ge/EJournal/Kartvelology/index.php?dir=issues&page=Issue&issueID=16&lng=En</ref>.
