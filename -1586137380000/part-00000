Sibton is unusual among Cistercian houses in that the Frater (the standing ruin) formed most of the south range, aligned east and west, with the screens passage and kitchens at its western end and the [[dais]] for the [[high table]] at the east, where the great blank arch still remains in the end wall. (The Frater should normally extend at right-angles to the south range.) On the west side of the cloister was a wall separating it from an open area or lane, beyond which the western range stood.

protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.  California in 2006 had stockpiled three 200-bed mobile hospitals with 50 million N95 respirators, 2,400 ventilators, and 21,000 additional patient beds, but the governor at the time, [[Jerry Brown]], disposed of them in 2011 as a budget cutting measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/coronavirus-california-mobile-hospitals-ventilators|title=California once had mobile hospitals and a ventilator stockpile.

protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.  California in 2006 had stockpiled three 200-bed mobile hospitals with 50 million N95 respirators, 2,400 ventilators, and 21,000 additional patient beds, but the governor at the time, [[Jerry Brown]], disposed of them in 2011 as a budget cutting measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/coronavirus-california-mobile-hospitals-ventilators|title=California once had mobile hospitals and a ventilator stockpile.

After his American film debut as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Jack Griffin]] in ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) he appeared in classic films such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Kings Row]]'' (both 1942), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).\n\nHe was a [[Tony Award]] winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Rains was considered to be \"one of the screen's great character stars\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\">{{cite web|last=McFarlane|first=Brian|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/546482/|title=Rains, Claude (1889-1967)|publisher=BFI screenoline|accessdate=30 December 2015}} From McFarlane's ''Encyclopedia of British Film'', London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.545</ref> who was, according to the ''All-Movie Guide'', \"at his best when playing cultured villains\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/58546/Claude-Rains/biography|title=Claude Rains|publisher=The New York Times/All-Movie Guide|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> During his lengthy career, he was greatly admired by many of his acting colleagues, such as [[Bette Davis]], [[Vincent Sherman]], [[Ronald Neame]], [[Albert Dekker]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Richard Chamberlain]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 in [[Clapham]], [[London]]. His parents were Emily Eliza ([[n\u00e9e]] Cox) and the stage actor [[Fred Rains|Frederick William Rains]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_mUJebJ4uwC&pg=PA181 |title=International Stars at War|isbn=9781557509659|last1=Wise|first1=James E.|last2=Baron|first2=Scott|year=2002}}</ref> He lived in the slums of London, and, in his own words, on \"the wrong side of the river Thames\".<ref name=\"Soister pg.1\">Soister pg. 1</ref> Rains was one of twelve children, all but three dying of malnutrition when still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. According to his daughter, Jessica Rains, he grew up with \"a very serious [[Cockney accent]] and a [[speech impediment]]\"<ref name=\"Harmetz p. 147\">Harmetz p. 147.</ref> which took the form of a stutter, causing him to call himself \"Willie Wains\".<ref>(J, Rains, interview,2000)</ref> His accent was so strong that his daughter could not understand a word he said when he used it to sing old Cockney songs to her or purposely used it to playfully annoy her. Rains left school after the second grade to sell papers so that he could bring the pennies and halfpennies home for his mother. He sang in the Palm Street Church choir, which also brought him a few pence to take home.\n[[File:Captain Claude Rains.jpg|thumb|left|Rains in his captain's uniform during the First World War]]\n\nBecause his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. It was here where he could watch actors up close as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at the age of 10 in the play ''Sweet Nell of Old Drury''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meredy.com/clauderains/cr-bio.html |publisher=meredy.com |title=The Sublime Claude Rains |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He then slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]] (telling actors when they were due on stage) at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] and later prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts. [[File:Actor, Claude Rains aged 23.jpg|thumb|right|A 23-year-old Rains in one of his early theatre roles, 1912]]\n\nRains decided to go to America in 1913 due to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres; but with the outbreak of World War{{nbsp}}I the following year, he returned to England to serve in the [[London Scottish Regiment]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonscottishregt.org|title=Welcome to The London Scottish Regiment Website|author=Default Admin User|work=londonscottishregt.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412093636/http://www.londonscottishregt.org/|archivedate=12 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> alongside fellow actors [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Cedric Hardwicke]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|date=2013|title=Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914|publisher=William Collins|isbn=978-0-007-51974-3|page=486}}</ref> In November 1916, Rains was involved in a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas attack]] at [[Vimy]], which resulted in him permanently losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye as well as suffering vocal chords damage.<ref name=BFI>{{cite web |last= Parkinson |first=David |date=7 November 2018 |title=Roll of honour: 15 movie legends who served in the First World War |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/film-people-first-world-war |newspaper=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> He never returned to combat but continue to serve with the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment|Bedfordshire Regiment]]; by the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].<ref name=BFI/>\n\nAfter the war ended, Rains remained in England, where he continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], the founder of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the [[elocution]] books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practicing every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father's voice, said, \"The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary [[Mid-Atlantic accent]]. It was 'his' voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in.\" Jessica Rains speaks of this in the interview on [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s 2004 DVD release of [[Phantom of the Opera]], recorded in 2000. Soon after changing his accent he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At the age of 29, he played the role of Clarkis in his one (and only) silent film, a British film titled ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920).\n\nDuring his early years, Rains also taught at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (RADA), where [[John Gielgud]] and [[Charles Laughton]] were among his students. In an interview for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Gielgud fondly remembered Rains: \n<blockquote>\nI learnt a great deal about acting from this gentleman. Claude Rains was one of my teachers at RADA. In fact he was one of the best and most popular teachers there. He was extremely attractive and needless to say, all the girls in my class were hopelessly in love with him. He had piercing dark eyes and a beautifully throaty voice, although he had, like [[Marlene Dietrich]], some trouble with the letter 'R'. He lacked inches and wore lifts to his shoes to increase his height. Stocky but handsome, Rains had broad shoulders and a mop of thick brown hair which he brushed over one eye. But by the time I first met him in the 1920s he was already much in demand as a character actor in London. I found him enormously helpful and encouraging to work with. I was always trying to copy him in my first years as an actor, until I decided to imitate [[No\u00ebl Coward]] instead.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nRains began his career in London theatre, achieving success in the title role of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] play ''Ulysses S. Grant'', the follow-up to the same playwright's ''[[Abraham Lincoln (play)|Abraham Lincoln]]''. He also portrayed Faulkland in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'', presented at London's Lyric Theatre in 1925. Rains returned to New York in 1927 to appear in what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. He moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' and the dramatisations of ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]'' and [[Pearl S. Buck]]'s novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (as a Chinese farmer).\n\n[[File:Claude Rains Broadway 1929.jpeg|thumb|left|Rains with Miriam Hopkins in ''Camel Through the Needle's Eye'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[New York City|New York]], 1929]]\n\nAlthough he had played the single supporting role in the silent, ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920),<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Rains came relatively late to film acting and while working for the [[Theatre Guild]], he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932) for a New York representative of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of [[James Whale]]'s ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) after his screen test and unique voice were inadvertently overheard from the next room.<ref name=\"Harmetz p. 147\"/><ref>Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&pg=PA102 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2007. p.102</ref> His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of [[Carl Laemmle]], who controlled [[Universal Pictures]] at the time, and had been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role.<ref name=\"Skal48\">Skal and Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT48 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], p.48-9</ref><ref>Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&pg=PA79 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], p.79</ref> According to Rains' daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the [[Dailies|rushes]] of the day's filming \"because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again.\"\n\nRains signed a long-term contract with [[Warner Bros.]] on 27 November 1935 with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over 7 years.<ref>David J. Skal, with Jessica Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT62 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2008, p.61-62</ref> He played the villainous role of [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). [[Roddy McDowall]] once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains' only reply was \"an enigmatic smile.\" Rains later revealed to his daughter that he'd enjoyed playing the prince as a [[homosexual]], by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film's co-director [[Michael Curtiz]] with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera.\"<ref>Harmetz p. 190.</ref> On loan to [[Columbia Pictures]], he portrayed a corrupt U.S. senator in ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), for which he received his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For his home studio, Warner Bros, he played Dr. Alexander Tower, who commits murder-suicide to spare his daughter a life of insanity in ''[[Kings Row]]'' (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Renault in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|title character]] in Universal's remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943).\n\nIn her 1987 memoir, ''This 'N That'', [[Bette Davis]] revealed that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]''; ''[[Now, Voyager]]''; ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]''; and ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'') was her favorite co-star.<ref>Davis and Herskowitz 1987, p. 26.</ref> Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed [[Julius Caesar]] in a large-budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw's ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945), filmed in [[UK|Britain]]. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked [[Gabriel Pascal]], the film's director and producer.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Shipman |first=David |date=1989 |title=The Great Movie Stars: 1, The Golden Years |url= |location=London |publisher=Macdonald |page=487 |isbn=978-0600338178 |author-link=David Shipman (writer)}}</ref> Rains followed it with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) as a refugee [[Nazi]] agent opposite [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Back in Britain, he appeared in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[The Passionate Friends (1949 film)|The Passionate Friends]]'' (1949).\n\n[[File:Claude Rains in Notorious trailer.jpg|thumb|Rains in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]\n\nHis only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of [[Robert Browning]]'s ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', with [[Van Johnson]] as the Piper. The [[NBC]] colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.\n\nRains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series.\nHe ventured into science fiction for [[Irwin Shaw]]'s ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960) and [[Antonio Margheriti]]'s ''[[Battle of the Worlds]]'' (1961). Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), his last film. In CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode \"Incident of Judgement Day\" (1963).\n\nHe additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some [[Bible]] stories for children on [[Capitol Records]], and reciting [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Enoch Arden (Strauss)|setting for narrator and piano]] of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem ''[[Enoch Arden]]'', with the piano solos performed by [[Glenn Gould]]. He starred in ''The Jeffersonian Heritage'', a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.<ref>\"The Jeffersonian Heritage,\" Broadcasting-Telecasting, 8 September 1952, 36 (trade advertisement).</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nJessica Rains remembered her father's work ethic:\n{{quote|He was interested in the process (of film). He loved acting.  When he came to California to do a film, I had to \"hear him his lines\" as he drove me to school every morning, 10 miles. He knew everybody's part. He knew the whole script before he came out (to film). I don't think many people did that.}}\n\nBette Davis in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]] said about Rains:\n{{quote|Well, of course he petrified me. The first time I played with him was in [[Carlota of Mexico|Carlotta]] (''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]''), and I had to make an entrance [into] the King of France's domain for a rehearsal, and he's playing the King of France ([[Napoleon III]]) in rehearsal. As all of us \"other era people,\" we don't just run through lines and say \"turn the camera\", we rehearse beforehand...Anyway Claude and I couldn't, and he was the King of France who loathed Carlotta, and I was a kid and petrified of Mr. Rains, so I thought he hated ''me.'' I didn't know he was playing the character. I thought, he thinks I just stink! What am I going to do? Eventually we worked together quite a lot and became really great friends, really great friends.}}\nDavis later went on to describe him: \"Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant.\" She also praised his performances: \"He was marvelous in ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'' and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn't terribly good, but he was so marvelous and the restaurant scene where he's talking about all the food...brilliant, and of course in ''[[Mr Skeffington|Mr. Skeffington]]'' he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant.\"\n\n[[Richard Chamberlain]] worked with Rains in what would be his second-to-last film, ''[[Twilight of Honor]]''. When interviewed for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Chamberlain said,{{quote|Claude Rains has to be considered one of the finest actors of the 20th century. As soon as you hear that marvelous, unmistakable voice of honey mixed with gravel, he becomes instantly recognizable. And that scornful right eyebrow which could freeze an adversary faster than and more effectively than any physical threat. He stood at a mere 5'6\", yet his enormous talent and immense stage presence made him a giant among his colleagues. During a stage and film career that spanned six decades, Rains encompassed some of the most memorable and exciting characters ever created by an actor. Villains were a Rains specialty, particularly those of a suave and sarcastic nature; and yet when the role called for it, Rains could be remarkably moving and even add a touch of pathos without losing any of his effectiveness.}}\n\nIn ''[[Twilight of Honor]]'' Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain's character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said: {{quote|He was in his seventies then and in failing health, yet he was charming and totally professional on the set. It was clear to us that he loved practicing his craft; he dazzled us all. Claude was an extremely private man--he never discussed his humble beginnings, his six marriages. But get him into a conversation about acting, and he opened up with delightful anecdotes and fascinating stories about his long life as a thespian.\n\nOne day on the set I mentioned to him that 'Notorious' was one of my favorite films, and Claude related with amusement the filming of a particular scene with [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Rains was a very small man and Bergman was quite tall, so in order to shoot them in close-up together (in the key scene) the resourceful [[Alfred Hitchcock]] had a ramp installed, so as Rains approaches Bergman on camera he appears taller than his co-star. Claude found this ramp business a bit embarrassing and very funny.\n\nI got another taste of Claude's witty nature shooting a scene in his [next-to-last] film, in which he had a long piece of dialogue. Generally he had no problem remembering his lines despite getting along in years. However, there was one particularly long scene shot late at night where he was having a lot of trouble with the dialogue, and kept making excuses. And finally he paused and said with a sheepish look \"[[Alibi Ike]], good old Alibi Ike\" (\"Alibi Ike\" being an expression based on a 1935 film of the same name, in which the lead character has a penchant for making up excuses). Of course in the finished film he played the scene flawlessly, as he always did. Claude Rains: truly a class act, on and off screen.}}\n\nMany years after Rains had gone to [[Hollywood]] and become a well-known film actor, [[John Gielgud]] is reputed to have commented, \"He was a great influence on me. I don't know what happened to him. I think he failed and went to America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000024/quotes|title=John Gielgud - Quotes - IMDb|work=imdb.com}}</ref> However, Gielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on [[Bette Davis]].\n\n{{quote|A number of clips from many of her most successful films were shown and I was particularly delighted, when, as soon as Claude Rains appeared in the close-up of one of the clips, the whole audience burst into a great wave of applause.}}Bette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud commented that he once wrote that \"The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures\", but he later went on to say, \"but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage's loss was the cinema's gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I'm so glad of that.\"\n\n==Personal life and death==\nRains became a [[naturalized citizen of the United States]] in 1939. He married six times, and was divorced from the first five of his wives: [[Isabel Jeans]] (married 1913\u20131915); Marie Hemingway (to whom Rains was married for less than a year in 1920); Beatrix Thomson (1924\u20138 April 1935); Frances Propper (9 April 1935 \u2013 1956); and the classical pianist [[Agi Jambor]] (4 November 1959 \u2013 1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death on 31 December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was born on 24 January 1938, the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT104 Skal and Rains], p.104</ref>\n\nHe acquired the {{Convert|380|acre|km2|adj=on}} Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in [[West Bradford Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Bradford Township]], [[Pennsylvania]] (just outside [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]]), in 1941. The farm became one of the \"great prides\" of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/movie-tv-memorabilia/photos/claude-rains-scrapbook-devoted-to-his-farm-stock-grange-total-12-items-/a/7006-49362.s|title=Claude Rains' Scrapbook Devoted to His Farm, Stock - Lot #49362 - Heritage Auctions|website=Heritage Auctions}}</ref> Here, he became a \"gentleman farmer\" and could relax and enjoy farming life with his then wife (Frances) churning the butter, their daughter collecting the eggs, with Rains himself ploughing the fields and cultivating the vegetable garden. He spent much of his time between film takes reading up on agricultural techniques to try when he got home. He sold the farm when his marriage to Propper ended in 1956; the building now, as then, is still referred to by locals as \"Rains' Place\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20101114/NEWS/311149969|title=Thinking about Claude Rains and the pastoral Stock Grange Farm|publisher=}}</ref> Rains spent his final years in [[Sandwich, New Hampshire|Sandwich]], [[New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Duckler|first=Ray|title=A Star's Last Act: The great Claude Rains spent his final years in New Hampshire|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=Concord Monitor|date=31 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130913193332/http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his final years, Rains decided to write his memoirs and engaged the help of journalist Jonathan Root to assist him.

He designed his own tombstone which reads \"All things once, Are things forever, Soul, once living, lives forever\".\n\nIn 2010, many of Rains' personal effects were put into an auction at [[Heritage Auctions]], including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters and photographs. Also included in the auction were many volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained many of his press cuttings and reviews from the beginning of his career. The majority of the items were used to help David J. Skal write his book on Rains, ''An Actor's Voice''. In 2011, the ivory military uniform (complete with medals) he wore as Captain Renault in ''Casablanca'' was put up for auction when noted actress and film historian [[Debbie Reynolds]] sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the [[Film memorabilia#1970 MGM auction|1970 MGM auction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/Claude-Rains-Captain-Louis-Renault-ivory-military-suit-from-Casablanca_i10657974|title=Claude Rains \"Captain Louis Renault\" ivory military suit from Casablanca|website=iCollector.com Online Auctions}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nIn 1951, Rains won a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' as well as the [[Delia Austrian medal]] for the same production. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] on four occasions: for ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943), ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]'' (1944) and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). Rains was awarded a Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6400 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on February 8, 1960.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Heroes (TV Series)|Heroes]]'' the character portrayed by [[Christopher Eccleston]] does not reveal his real name and uses the alias [[Claude (Heroes)|'Claude Rains']] due to his ability to turn himself, any personal objects he touches, and other people [[Invisibility|invisible]]; his alias is an obvious homage to Rains who played ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!

six decades. After his American film debut as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Jack Griffin]] in ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) he appeared in classic films such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Kings Row]]'' (both 1942), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).\n\nHe was a [[Tony Award]] winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Rains was considered to be \"one of the screen's great character stars\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\">{{cite web|last=McFarlane|first=Brian|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/546482/|title=Rains, Claude (1889-1967)|publisher=BFI screenoline|accessdate=30 December 2015}} From McFarlane's ''Encyclopedia of British Film'', London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.545</ref> who was, according to the ''All-Movie Guide'', \"at his best when playing cultured villains\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/58546/Claude-Rains/biography|title=Claude Rains|publisher=The New York Times/All-Movie Guide|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> During his lengthy career, he was greatly admired by many of his acting colleagues, such as [[Bette Davis]], [[Vincent Sherman]], [[Ronald Neame]], [[Albert Dekker]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Richard Chamberlain]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 in [[Clapham]], [[London]]. His parents were Emily Eliza ([[n\u00e9e]] Cox) and the stage actor [[Fred Rains|Frederick William Rains]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_mUJebJ4uwC&pg=PA181 |title=International Stars at War|isbn=9781557509659|last1=Wise|first1=James E.|last2=Baron|first2=Scott|year=2002}}</ref> He lived in the slums of London, and, in his own words, on \"the wrong side of the river Thames\".<ref name=\"Soister pg.1\">Soister pg. 1</ref> Rains was one of twelve children, all but three dying of malnutrition when still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. According to his daughter, Jessica Rains, he grew up with \"a very serious [[Cockney accent]] and a [[speech impediment]]\"<ref name=\"Harmetz p. 147\">Harmetz p. 147.</ref> which took the form of a stutter, causing him to call himself \"Willie Wains\".<ref>(J, Rains, interview,2000)</ref> His accent was so strong that his daughter could not understand a word he said when he used it to sing old Cockney songs to her or purposely used it to playfully annoy her. Rains left school after the second grade to sell papers so that he could bring the pennies and halfpennies home for his mother. He sang in the Palm Street Church choir, which also brought him a few pence to take home.\n[[File:Captain Claude Rains.jpg|thumb|left|Rains in his captain's uniform during the First World War]]\n\nBecause his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. It was here where he could watch actors up close as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at the age of 10 in the play ''Sweet Nell of Old Drury''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meredy.com/clauderains/cr-bio.html |publisher=meredy.com |title=The Sublime Claude Rains |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He then slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]] (telling actors when they were due on stage) at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] and later prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts. [[File:Actor, Claude Rains aged 23.jpg|thumb|right|A 23-year-old Rains in one of his early theatre roles, 1912]]\n\nRains decided to go to America in 1913 due to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres; but with the outbreak of World War{{nbsp}}I the following year, he returned to England to serve in the [[London Scottish Regiment]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonscottishregt.org|title=Welcome to The London Scottish Regiment Website|author=Default Admin User|work=londonscottishregt.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412093636/http://www.londonscottishregt.org/|archivedate=12 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> alongside fellow actors [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[Cedric Hardwicke]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|date=2013|title=Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914|publisher=William Collins|isbn=978-0-007-51974-3|page=486}}</ref> In November 1916, Rains was involved in a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas attack]] at [[Vimy]], which resulted in him permanently losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye as well as suffering vocal chords damage.<ref name=BFI>{{cite web |last= Parkinson |first=David |date=7 November 2018 |title=Roll of honour: 15 movie legends who served in the First World War |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/film-people-first-world-war |newspaper=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> He never returned to combat but continue to serve with the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment|Bedfordshire Regiment]]; by the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].<ref name=BFI/>\n\nAfter the war ended, Rains remained in England, where he continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], the founder of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the [[elocution]] books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practicing every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father's voice, said, \"The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary [[Mid-Atlantic accent]]. It was 'his' voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in.\" Jessica Rains speaks of this in the interview on [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s 2004 DVD release of [[Phantom of the Opera]], recorded in 2000. Soon after changing his accent he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At the age of 29, he played the role of Clarkis in his one (and only) silent film, a British film titled ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920).\n\nDuring his early years, Rains also taught at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (RADA), where [[John Gielgud]] and [[Charles Laughton]] were among his students. In an interview for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Gielgud fondly remembered Rains: \n<blockquote>\nI learnt a great deal about acting from this gentleman. Claude Rains was one of my teachers at RADA. In fact he was one of the best and most popular teachers there. He was extremely attractive and needless to say, all the girls in my class were hopelessly in love with him. He had piercing dark eyes and a beautifully throaty voice, although he had, like [[Marlene Dietrich]], some trouble with the letter 'R'. He lacked inches and wore lifts to his shoes to increase his height. Stocky but handsome, Rains had broad shoulders and a mop of thick brown hair which he brushed over one eye. But by the time I first met him in the 1920s he was already much in demand as a character actor in London. I found him enormously helpful and encouraging to work with. I was always trying to copy him in my first years as an actor, until I decided to imitate [[No\u00ebl Coward]] instead.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nRains began his career in London theatre, achieving success in the title role of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] play ''Ulysses S. Grant'', the follow-up to the same playwright's ''[[Abraham Lincoln (play)|Abraham Lincoln]]''. He also portrayed Faulkland in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'', presented at London's Lyric Theatre in 1925. Rains returned to New York in 1927 to appear in what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. He moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' and the dramatisations of ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]'' and [[Pearl S. Buck]]'s novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (as a Chinese farmer).\n\n[[File:Claude Rains Broadway 1929.jpeg|thumb|left|Rains with Miriam Hopkins in ''Camel Through the Needle's Eye'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[New York City|New York]], 1929]]\n\nAlthough he had played the single supporting role in the silent, ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920),<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Rains came relatively late to film acting and while working for the [[Theatre Guild]], he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932) for a New York representative of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of [[James Whale]]'s ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) after his screen test and unique voice were inadvertently overheard from the next room.<ref name=\"Harmetz p. 147\"/><ref>Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&pg=PA102 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2007. p.102</ref> His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of [[Carl Laemmle]], who controlled [[Universal Pictures]] at the time, and had been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role.<ref name=\"Skal48\">Skal and Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT48 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], p.48-9</ref><ref>Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&pg=PA79 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], p.79</ref> According to Rains' daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the [[Dailies|rushes]] of the day's filming \"because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again.\"\n\nRains signed a long term contract with [[Warner Bros.]] on 27 November 1935 with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over 7 years.<ref>David J. Skal, with Jessica Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT62 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2008, p.61-62</ref> He played the villainous role of [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). [[Roddy McDowall]] once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains' only reply was \"an enigmatic smile.\" Rains later revealed to his daughter that he'd enjoyed playing the prince as a [[homosexual]], by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film's co-director [[Michael Curtiz]] with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera.\"<ref>Harmetz p. 190.</ref> On loan to [[Columbia Pictures]], he portrayed a corrupt U.S. senator in ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), for which he received his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For his home studio, Warner Bros, he played Dr. Alexander Tower, who commits murder-suicide to spare his daughter a life of insanity in ''[[Kings Row]]'' (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Renault in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|title character]] in Universal's remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943).\n\nIn her 1987 memoir, ''This 'N That'', [[Bette Davis]] revealed that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]''; ''[[Now, Voyager]]''; ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]''; and ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'') was her favorite co-star.<ref>Davis and Herskowitz 1987, p. 26.</ref> Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed [[Julius Caesar]] in a large-budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw's ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945), filmed in [[UK|Britain]]. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked [[Gabriel Pascal]], the film's director and producer.<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Shipman |first=David |date=1989 |title=The Great Movie Stars: 1, The Golden Years |url= |location=London |publisher=Macdonald |page=487 |isbn=978-0600338178 |author-link=David Shipman (writer)}}</ref> Rains followed it with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) as a refugee [[Nazi]] agent opposite [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Back in Britain, he appeared in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[The Passionate Friends (1949 film)|The Passionate Friends]]'' (1949).\n\n[[File:Claude Rains in Notorious trailer.jpg|thumb|Rains in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]\n\nHis only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of [[Robert Browning]]'s ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', with [[Van Johnson]] as the Piper. The [[NBC]] colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.\n\nRains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series.\nHe ventured into science fiction for [[Irwin Shaw]]'s ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960) and [[Antonio Margheriti]]'s ''[[Battle of the Worlds]]'' (1961). Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), his last film. In CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode \"Incident of Judgement Day\" (1963).\n\nHe additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some [[Bible]] stories for children on [[Capitol Records]], and reciting [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Enoch Arden (Strauss)|setting for narrator and piano]] of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem ''[[Enoch Arden]]'', with the piano solos performed by [[Glenn Gould]]. He starred in ''The Jeffersonian Heritage'', a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.<ref>\"The Jeffersonian Heritage,\" Broadcasting-Telecasting, 8 September 1952, 36 (trade advertisement).</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nJessica Rains remembered her father's work ethic:\n{{quote|He was interested in the process (of film). He loved acting.  When he came to California to do a film, I had to \"hear him his lines\" as he drove me to school every morning, 10 miles. He knew everybody's part. He knew the whole script before he came out (to film). I don't think many people did that.}}\n\nBette Davis in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]] said about Rains:\n{{quote|Well, of course he petrified me. The first time I played with him was in [[Carlota of Mexico|Carlotta]] (''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]''), and I had to make an entrance [into] the King of France's domain for a rehearsal, and he's playing the King of France ([[Napoleon III]]) in rehearsal. As all of us \"other era people,\" we don't just run through lines and say \"turn the camera\", we rehearse beforehand...Anyway Claude and I couldn't, and he was the King of France who loathed Carlotta, and I was a kid and petrified of Mr. Rains, so I thought he hated ''me.'' I didn't know he was playing the character. I thought, he thinks I just stink! What am I going to do? Eventually we worked together quite a lot and became really great friends, really great friends.}}\nDavis later went on to describe him: \"Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant.\" She also praised his performances: \"He was marvelous in ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'' and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn't terribly good, but he was so marvelous and the restaurant scene where he's talking about all the food...brilliant, and of course in ''[[Mr Skeffington|Mr. Skeffington]]'' he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant.\"\n\n[[Richard Chamberlain]] worked with Rains in what would be his second-to-last film, ''[[Twilight of Honor]]''. When interviewed for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Chamberlain said,{{quote|Claude Rains has to be considered one of the finest actors of the 20th century. As soon as you hear that marvelous, unmistakable voice of honey mixed with gravel, he becomes instantly recognizable. And that scornful right eyebrow which could freeze an adversary faster than and more effectively than any physical threat. He stood at a mere 5'6\", yet his enormous talent and immense stage presence made him a giant among his colleagues. During a stage and film career that spanned six decades, Rains encompassed some of the most memorable and exciting characters ever created by an actor. Villains were a Rains specialty, particularly those of a suave and sarcastic nature; and yet when the role called for it, Rains could be remarkably moving and even add a touch of pathos without losing any of his effectiveness.}}\n\nIn ''[[Twilight of Honor]]'' Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain's character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said: {{quote|He was in his seventies then and in failing health, yet he was charming and totally professional on the set. It was clear to us that he loved practicing his craft; he dazzled us all. Claude was an extremely private man--he never discussed his humble beginnings, his six marriages. But get him into a conversation about acting, and he opened up with delightful anecdotes and fascinating stories about his long life as a thespian.\n\nOne day on the set I mentioned to him that 'Notorious' was one of my favorite films, and Claude related with amusement the filming of a particular scene with [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Rains was a very small man and Bergman was quite tall, so in order to shoot them in close-up together (in the key scene) the resourceful [[Alfred Hitchcock]] had a ramp installed, so as Rains approaches Bergman on camera he appears taller than his co-star. Claude found this ramp business a bit embarrassing and very funny.\n\nI got another taste of Claude's witty nature shooting a scene in his [next-to-last] film, in which he had a long piece of dialogue. Generally he had no problem remembering his lines despite getting along in years. However, there was one particularly long scene shot late at night where he was having a lot of trouble with the dialogue, and kept making excuses. And finally he paused and said with a sheepish look \"[[Alibi Ike]], good old Alibi Ike\" (\"Alibi Ike\" being an expression based on a 1935 film of the same name, in which the lead character has a penchant for making up excuses). Of course in the finished film he played the scene flawlessly, as he always did. Claude Rains: truly a class act, on and off screen.}}\n\nMany years after Rains had gone to [[Hollywood]] and become a well-known film actor, [[John Gielgud]] is reputed to have commented, \"He was a great influence on me. I don't know what happened to him. I think he failed and went to America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000024/quotes|title=John Gielgud - Quotes - IMDb|work=imdb.com}}</ref> However, Gielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on [[Bette Davis]].\n\n{{quote|A number of clips from many of her most successful films were shown and I was particularly delighted, when, as soon as Claude Rains appeared in the close-up of one of the clips, the whole audience burst into a great wave of applause.}}Bette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud commented that he once wrote that \"The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures\", but he later went on to say, \"but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage's loss was the cinema's gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I'm so glad of that.\"\n\n==Personal life and death==\nRains became a [[naturalized citizen of the United States]] in 1939. He married six times, and was divorced from the first five of his wives: [[Isabel Jeans]] (married 1913\u20131915); Marie Hemingway (to whom Rains was married for less than a year in 1920); Beatrix Thomson (1924\u20138 April 1935); Frances Propper (9 April 1935 \u2013 1956); and the classical pianist [[Agi Jambor]] (4 November 1959 \u2013 1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death on 31 December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was born on 24 January 1938, the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&pg=PT104 Skal and Rains], p.104</ref>\n\nHe acquired the {{Convert|380|acre|km2|adj=on}} Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in [[West Bradford Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Bradford Township]], [[Pennsylvania]] (just outside [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]]), in 1941.

He spent much of his time between film takes reading up on agricultural techniques to try when he got home. He sold the farm when his marriage to Propper ended in 1956; the building now, as then, is still referred to by locals as \"Rains' Place\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20101114/NEWS/311149969|title=Thinking about Claude Rains and the pastoral Stock Grange Farm|publisher=}}</ref> Rains spent his final years in [[Sandwich, New Hampshire|Sandwich]], [[New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Duckler|first=Ray|title=A Star's Last Act: The great Claude Rains spent his final years in New Hampshire|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=Concord Monitor|date=31 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130913193332/http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his final years, Rains decided to write his memoirs and engaged the help of journalist Jonathan Root to assist him.

He designed his own tombstone which reads \"All things once, Are things forever, Soul, once living, lives forever\".\n\nIn 2010, many of Rains' personal effects were put into an auction at [[Heritage Auctions]], including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters and photographs. Also included in the auction were many volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained many of his press cuttings and reviews from the beginning of his career. The majority of the items were used to help David J. Skal write his book on Rains, ''An Actor's Voice''. In 2011, the ivory military uniform (complete with medals) he wore as Captain Renault in ''Casablanca'' was put up for auction when noted actress and film historian [[Debbie Reynolds]] sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the [[Film memorabilia#1970 MGM auction|1970 MGM auction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/Claude-Rains-Captain-Louis-Renault-ivory-military-suit-from-Casablanca_i10657974|title=Claude Rains \"Captain Louis Renault\" ivory military suit from Casablanca|website=iCollector.com Online Auctions}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nIn 1951, Rains won a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' as well as the [[Delia Austrian medal]] for the same production. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] on four occasions: for ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943), ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]'' (1944) and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). Rains was awarded a Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6400 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on February 8, 1960.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Heroes (TV Series)|Heroes]]'' the character portrayed by [[Christopher Eccleston]] does not reveal his real name and uses the alias [[Claude (Heroes)|'Claude Rains']] due to his ability to turn himself, any personal objects he touches, and other people [[Invisibility|invisible]]; his alias is an obvious homage to Rains who played ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!
