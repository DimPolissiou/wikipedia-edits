Most projectile weapons use the compression or expansion of gases as their motive force.]]\n\n[[Blowgun]]s and [[pneumatic rifle]]s use compressed gases, while most other [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s utilize expanding gases liberated by sudden chemical reactions by [[propellant]]s like [[smokeless powder]]. [[Light-gas gun]]s use a combination of these mechanisms.\n\n[[Railgun]]s utilize electromagnetic fields to provide a constant acceleration along the entire length of the device, greatly increasing the [[muzzle velocity]].\n\nSome projectiles provide propulsion during flight by means of a [[rocket engine]] or [[jet engine]]. In military terminology, a [[rocket]] is unguided, while a [[missile]] is [[guided missile|guided]]. Note the two meanings of \"rocket\" (weapon and engine): an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] is a guided missile with a rocket engine.\n\nAn explosion, whether or not by a weapon, causes the debris to act as multiple high velocity projectiles. An explosive weapon, or device may also be designed to produce many high velocity projectiles by the break-up of its casing, these are correctly termed [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]].\n\n==Delivery projectiles==\nMany projectiles, e.g. [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], may carry an explosive charge or another chemical or biological substance. Aside from explosive payload, a projectile can be designed to cause special damage, e.g. fire (see also [[early thermal weapons]]), or poisoning (see also [[arrow poison]]).\n\n==Sport projectiles==\n[[Image:baseball.jpg|thumb|Ball speeds of {{convert|105|mph|km/h}} have been recorded in [[baseball]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/2010/08/aroldis_chapman.html|title=Aroldis Chapman hits 105 mph|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-08-30|first=Matt|last=Pepin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831185316/http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/2010/08/aroldis_chapman.html|archivedate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n]]\nIn projectile motion the most important force applied to the \u2018projectile\u2019 is the propelling force, in this case the propelling forces are the muscles that act upon the ball to make it move, and the stronger the force applied, the more propelling force, which means the projectile (the ball) will travel farther. See [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]], [[bowling]].\n\n==Kinetic projectiles==\n\n{{See also|Kinetic energy penetrator|Terminal ballistics#Hypervelocity|l2=Terminal ballistics \u2013 Hypervelocity|Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle}}\nA projectile that does not contain an explosive charge or any other kind of payload is termed a ''kinetic projectile'', ''kinetic energy weapon'', ''kinetic energy warhead'', ''kinetic warhead'', ''kinetic kill vehicle'' or ''kinetic penetrator''. Typical kinetic energy weapons are blunt projectiles such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[round shot]]s, pointed ones such as [[arrow]]s, and somewhat pointed ones such as [[bullet]]s. Among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from [[railgun]]s, [[coilgun]]s, and [[mass driver]]s, as well as [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. All of these weapons work by attaining a high [[muzzle velocity]], or initial velocity, generally up to ([[hypervelocity]]), and [[collision|collide]] with their targets, converting their [[kinetic energy]] into destructive shock waves and heat. Other types of kinetic weapons are accelerated over time by a rocket engine, or by gravity. In either case, it is the [[kinetic energy]] of the projectile that destroys its target.\n\nSome kinetic weapons for targeting objects in [[spaceflight]] are [[anti-satellite weapon]]s and [[anti-ballistic missile]]s. Since in order to reach an object in orbit it is necessary to attain an extremely high velocity, their released kinetic energy alone is enough to destroy their target; explosives are not necessary. For example: the energy of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] is 4.6&nbsp;MJ/kg, and the energy of a kinetic kill vehicle with a closing speed of {{cvt|10|km/s|mph|||}} is 50&nbsp;MJ/kg. This saves costly weight and there is no [[detonation]] to be precisely timed. This method, however, requires direct contact with the target, which requires a more accurate [[trajectory]]. Some hit-to-kill warheads are additionally equipped with an explosive directional warhead to enhance the kill probability (e.g. Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] missile or U.S. [[MIM-104 Patriot#MIM-104F (PAC-3)|Patriot PAC-3]]).\n\nWith regard to anti-missile weapons, the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2]] have explosives, while the [[Kinetic Energy Interceptor]] (KEI), [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]] (LEAP, used in [[Aegis BMDS]]), and [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]] do not (see [[Missile Defense Agency]]).\n\nA kinetic projectile can also be dropped from aircraft.

Most projectile weapons use the compression or expansion of gases as their motive force.]]\n\n[[Blowgun]]s and [[pneumatic rifle]]s use compressed gases, while most other [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s utilize expanding gases liberated by sudden chemical reactions by [[propellant]]s like [[smokeless powder]]. [[Light-gas gun]]s use a combination of these mechanisms.\n\n[[Railgun]]s utilize electromagnetic fields to provide a constant acceleration along the entire length of the device, greatly increasing the [[muzzle velocity]].\n\nSome projectiles provide propulsion during flight by means of a [[rocket engine]] or [[jet engine]]. In military terminology, a [[rocket]] is unguided, while a [[missile]] is [[guided missile|guided]]. Note the two meanings of \"rocket\" (weapon and engine): an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] is a guided missile with a rocket engine.\n\nAn explosion, whether or not by a weapon, causes the debris to act as multiple high velocity projectiles. An explosive weapon, or device may also be designed to produce many high velocity projectiles by the break-up of its casing, these are correctly termed [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]].\n\n==Delivery projectiles==\nMany projectiles, e.g. [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], may carry an explosive charge or another chemical or biological substance. Aside from explosive payload, a projectile can be designed to cause special damage, e.g. fire (see also [[early thermal weapons]]), or poisoning (see also [[arrow poison]]).\n\n==Sport projectiles==\n[[Image:baseball.jpg|thumb|Ball speeds of {{convert|105|mph|km/h}} have been recorded in [[baseball]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/2010/08/aroldis_chapman.html|title=Aroldis Chapman hits 105 mph|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-08-30|first=Matt|last=Pepin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831185316/http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/2010/08/aroldis_chapman.html|archivedate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n]]\nIn projectile motion the most important force applied to the \u2018projectile\u2019 is the propelling force, in this case the propelling forces are the muscles that act upon the ball to make it move, and the stronger the force applied, the more propelling force, which means the projectile (the ball) will travel farther. See [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]], [[bowling]].\n\n==Kinetic projectiles==\n\n{{See also|Kinetic energy penetrator|Terminal ballistics#Hypervelocity|l2=Terminal ballistics \u2013 Hypervelocity|Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle}}\nA projectile that does not contain an explosive charge or any other kind of payload is termed a ''kinetic projectile'', ''kinetic energy weapon'', ''kinetic energy warhead'', ''kinetic warhead'', ''kinetic kill vehicle'' or ''kinetic penetrator''. Typical kinetic energy weapons are blunt projectiles such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[round shot]]s, pointed ones such as [[arrow]]s, and somewhat pointed ones such as [[bullet]]s. Among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from [[railgun]]s, [[coilgun]]s, and [[mass driver]]s, as well as [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. All of these weapons work by attaining a high [[muzzle velocity]], or initial velocity, generally up to ([[hypervelocity]]), and [[collision|collide]] with their targets, converting their [[kinetic energy]] into destructive shock waves and heat. Other types of kinetic weapons are accelerated over time by a rocket engine, or by gravity. In either case, it is the [[kinetic energy]] of the projectile that destroys its target.\n\nSome kinetic weapons for targeting objects in [[spaceflight]] are [[anti-satellite weapon]]s and [[anti-ballistic missile]]s. Since in order to reach an object in orbit it is necessary to attain an extremely high velocity, their released kinetic energy alone is enough to destroy their target; explosives are not necessary. For example: the energy of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] is 4.6&nbsp;MJ/kg, and the energy of a kinetic kill vehicle with a closing speed of {{cvt|10|km/s|mph|||}} is 50&nbsp;MJ/kg. This saves costly weight and there is no [[detonation]] to be precisely timed. This method, however, requires direct contact with the target, which requires a more accurate [[trajectory]]. Some hit-to-kill warheads are additionally equipped with an explosive directional warhead to enhance the kill probability (e.g. Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] missile or U.S. [[MIM-104 Patriot#MIM-104F (PAC-3)|Patriot PAC-3]]).\n\nWith regard to anti-missile weapons, the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2]] have explosives, while the [[Kinetic Energy Interceptor]] (KEI), [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]] (LEAP, used in [[Aegis BMDS]]), and [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]] do not (see [[Missile Defense Agency]]).\n\nA kinetic projectile can also be dropped from aircraft. This is applied by replacing the explosives of a regular bomb with a non-explosive material (e.g. concrete), for a precision hit with less [[collateral damage]]. A typical bomb has a mass of {{cvt|900|kg||||}} and a speed of impact of {{cvt|800|kph||||}}. It is also applied for training the act of dropping a bomb with explosives. [http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/10/991007-iraq.htm] This method has been used in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and the subsequent military operations in [[Iraq]] by mating concrete-filled training bombs with [[JDAM]] [[GPS]] guidance kits, to attack vehicles and other relatively \"soft\" targets located too close to civilian structures for the use of conventional [[high explosive]] bombs.\n\nA [[Prompt Global Strike]] may use a kinetic weapon.

in charge of [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]]. Woodhouse played football as a central [[midfielder]], and competed as a [[light-welterweight]] boxer. He is the former British light-welterweight champion. His career in [[the Football League]] spanned across nine seasons, earning four [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 football team]]. Woodhouse's professional boxing record stands at 29 fights 22 wins, 13 of which are by [[knock-out]], and 7 defeats.\n\nHe started his footballing career with [[York City F.C.|York City]]'s centre of excellence before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. In November 2001, he was transferred to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a fee of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1 million, before joining [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in January 2003, on loan for five months. He then joined [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on a free transfer in October 2003. In May 2005, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for \u00a325,000, before joining [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] just eight months later in January 2006.

In September 2006, he won his first professional boxing match, defeating Dean Marcantonio, on points, knocking him down twice in the final round.\n\nHe was convicted of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006.
