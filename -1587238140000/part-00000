The inner side plates feature the WWE logo and are encircled with the meander pattern, while the outer side plates feature a single Spartan helmet facing inward. When this belt design was introduced in 2010, the plates were bronze colored and featured the long-standing WWE scratch logo and the straps were black. In August 2014, the belts, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the scratch logo with WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nIn August 2016, after the reintroduction of the brand split and the creation of the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, the WWE Tag Team Championship was renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship. The belts received an update on December 19 that year to reflect the name change. Featuring the same physical design, the plates were made silver and the straps changed to red, countering the silver plates on blue straps design of the SmackDown Tag Team Championship belts. While most of WWE's other championships have been updated to feature customizable side plates for the champion's logos, the Raw and SmackDown tag titles have yet received this update and also lack a nameplate, which is only featured on the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] belt.\n\n==Reigns==\n{{Main|List of WWE Raw Tag Team Champions}}\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 79 reigns between 62 teams composed of 90 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Cesaro and Sheamus]] have the most reigns at 4, while individually, [[Seth Rollins]] has the most with six. [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]], [[Kofi Kingston]], and [[Xavier Woods]]) have the longest reign at 483 days and are also the only team to hold the championship for over one consecutive year, while [[John Cena]] and [[The Miz]] have the shortest reign as a team at 9 minutes, due to [[The Corre]] invoking their rematch clause immediately after losing the title. As a team, The New Day also have the longest combined reign at 532 days, while Kingston individually has the longest combined reign at 817 days (533 and 818 days, respectively, as recognized by WWE). [[John Cone#Personal life|Nicholas]] is the youngest champion with this title and in WWE history at 10 years old, while [[Billy Gunn]] is the oldest champion at age 50.\n\n[[The Street Profits]] ([[Angelo Dawkins]] and [[Montez Ford]]) are the current champions in their first reign both as a team and individually. They defeated [[Seth Rollins]] and [[Buddy Murphy|Murphy]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Chance match|Last Chance match]]. on March 2, 2020 on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tag team championships in WWE]]\n\n== References ==\n; General\n* {{cite web|title=World Tag Team Championship title history|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2010-09-19}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/raw-tag-team-championship|title=Raw Tag Team Championship title history|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2016-09-05}}\n; Specific\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/raw-tag-team-championship Official Raw Tag Team Title History]\n{{WWE Tag Team Championship}}\n{{WWE Championships}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wwe Tag Team Championship}}\n[[Category:WWE Raw]]\n[[Category:WWE tag team championships]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE}}\n{{Infobox pro wrestling championship\n|name=WWE Raw Tag Team Championship\n|image=WWE Raw Tag Team Championship.png\n|alt=\n|caption=The current Raw Tag Team Championship belt<br/>(2016\u2013present)\n|currentholder= [[The Street Profits]]<br>{{small|([[Angelo Dawkins]] and [[Montez Ford]])}}\n|won= March 2, 2020\n|created=October 20, 2002\n|promotion=[[WWE]]\n|brand=[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]\n|firstchamp=[[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]]\n|mostreigns=As tag team: [[Cesaro and Sheamus]] (4 reigns)<br>As individual: [[Seth Rollins]] (6)\n|longestreign=[[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] (483 days)\n|shortestreign=[[John Cena]] and [[The Miz]] (9 minutes)\n|oldest=[[Billy Gunn]] ({{age in years and days|1963|11|01|2014|01|26}})\n|youngest=[[John Cone#Personal life|Nicholas]] (10 years)\n|heaviest=[[Big Show and Kane]] (808 lbs combined) (Big Show 485 pounds and Kane 323 pounds)\n|lightest=[[Paul London and Brian Kendrick]] (365 lbs combined)\n|pastnames=* WWE Tag Team Championship<br>(2002\u20132009, 2010\u20132016)\n* Unified WWE Tag Team Championship<br>(2009\u20132010)\n* '''WWE Raw Tag Team Championship'''<br>(2016\u2013present)\n|pastlookimages=}}\nThe '''WWE Raw Tag Team Championship''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[World Tag Team Championship|world tag team championship]] created and promoted by the [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[WWE]], defended on their [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]]. It is one of three male tag team championships among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] and the [[NXT Tag Team Championship]] on [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. The current champions are [[The Street Profits]] ([[Angelo Dawkins]] and [[Montez Ford]]), who are in their first reign.\n\nThe championship was originally established as the WWE Tag Team Championship on October 20, 2002, and the team of [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]] were the inaugural champions. It was introduced for the SmackDown brand as a second title for [[tag team]]s in the promotion to complement WWE's original [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]], which became exclusive to Raw. Both titles were [[Championship unification|unified]] in 2009 and were collectively referred to as the \"Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\" while officially remaining independently active until the World Tag Team Championship was formally decommissioned in 2010. As a result of the [[2016 WWE Draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename, and SmackDown created the SmackDown Tag Team Championship as a counterpart title.\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|header = Inaugural Championship Team\n|width = 150\n|image1 = Kurt Angle 2005-08-21.jpg\n|caption1 = [[Kurt Angle]]\n|image2 = Chris Benoit in the Ring.jpg\n|caption2 = [[Chris Benoit]]\n}}\nAfter the company's initial [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in the spring of 2002, the original [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] was reassigned that following summer to appear and be defended exclusively on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand, leaving the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand without a tag team title. As a result, then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] introduced the WWE Tag Team Championship and commissioned it to be the tag team title for the SmackDown brand on October 3, 2002. She stated that the inaugural champions would be determined from an eight-team tournament. On October 20, 2002, the team of [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]] defeated [[Rey Mysterio]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] at [[No Mercy (2002)|No Mercy]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural WWE Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"RawTag\"/>\n\n[[File:Deuce 'N Domino.jpg|thumb|right|One-time champions [[Deuce 'n Domino]] (right and left), shown here with the original design of the championship when it was still known as the WWE Tag Team Championship of [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]]]\nOn October 17, 2007, SmackDown and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] announced a talent sharing agreement that enabled talent from either brand's roster to compete on both brands. As a result, the title became eligible to be contended and defended on both brands.
