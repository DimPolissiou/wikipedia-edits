Two years later, after having been hauled from one foster home to the next, including her uncle's where an older cousin of hers attempted to sexually abuse her from reading her father's novel on sex, Emily lives with June (Chiarain) and Steve (Loui Vangelder), foster parents she feels are not the worst but too suffocating, often rebuffing their attempts at kindness, notably June's. Emily feels June pressures her to be happy when she finds herself incapable of doing so due to her [[clinical depression]]. In the present, she often reflects on her happy earlier childhood (Millie Donnelly, Hunter and Sadie Fitzmaurice, Sarah Minto) with her father, her unconventional homeschooled education with him and how he changed dramatically after the death of her mother, also named Emily (Mullins) on the night of her birthday in a car accident, an event that led to his [[mental breakdown]]; he became obsessive with writing, refusing to eat and sleep and was preoccupied with the concept that humans and the surrounding universe, such as a blade of grass, shared the same molecules. As an ode to her mother, Emily dons an intricate bracelet she used to wear at all times.\n\nEmily is enrolled in a new secondary school and quickly attracts the attention of an awkward half-Irish, half-English classmate Arden (Webster) who is unrequitedly smitten with her, though she is initially standoffish and uninterested in his attempts of a relationship. Contrarily, Emily is outcast by her teachers and bullied by her peers (Hughes) for her oddity and intellectual arrogance, such as refusing to introduce herself on her first day and rebelling against an assignment to dissect a [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] poem \"Ode on Intimations of Immortality\" for its obvious sexual message. On the day of her 16th birthday where Emily is troubled at the absence of a [[birthday card]] from her father, a tradition he has kept since his commitment, she contemplates [[suicide]] at the bottom of the school pool, much to the concern and frustration of her swimming teacher (McCann) who is forced to pull her to safety. Not comprehending her actions, she is further humiliated by her classmates as she is banned from class. Later that afternoon, Arden drops by her home to deliver a present, an old book handed down to him by his Irish grandmother (McCusker), [[Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Emily does not thank him, though accepts the gift.\n\nThereafter, she welcomes him accompanying her on their way home from school. When she returns home however, she grows upset at still finding that no letter from her father has arrived in the mail and despite June's assurance, she has an emotional meltdown. The next morning, she meets Arden at his home during a confrontation with his strict, physically abusive father (Conlon) and sensitive, submissive mother (White) and pleads for him to help her travel to the psychiatric institution and rescue Robert. At first reluctant, Arden eventually agrees as they both skip school. At first, they attempt to hitchhike in the rain with no luck until Arden enlists the help of his Granny to borrow her 70s canary-yellow [[Renault 4]]. After a full day on the road, on the following morning the two stop by a supermarket for breakfast, though Emily manipulates her way into only paying for a bouquet of flowers for Robert while shoplifting the rest, which upsets Arden given he would rather pay \"like normal people\" would, prompting Emily to justify that the money would be more useful towards border crossing and questions what it means to be \"normal.\"\n\nFollowing this incident, Emily grows paranoid of authority, believing they will attempt to stop her of reaching her destination and at one point, orders Arden to drive away from a curious policeman (\u00d3 H\u00e9alai) questioning them for IDs. Camping on the beach for the night, Emily and Arden are ambushed by a local gang. When Arden is beaten in an outnumbered fight and runs towards the car for help, Emily is left vulnerable inside the tent where she is threatened to be [[rape]]d by the gang's leader, telling him coldly, \"Fuck off.\" However, Arden returns having retrieved his deceased grandfather's handgun from the glove compartment, frightening the gang into submission as they flee. A mutual trust therein develops between Emily and Arden as they eventually arrive at the institution.\n\nArden invents a theatrical distraction atop the roof of one of the buildings, entertaining the patients whilst alarming the orderlies as Emily, bouquet in hand, searches for Robert. Coming upon his room however, she finds not her father but Dr. Golding (McGovern) who quietly informs her that her father is no longer at the facility. Inviting her to his office, he explains to her that the hospital does not hold people against their will, that Robert, after sometime, voluntarily admitted himself, a fact that greatly upsets Emily. Destroying the flowers outside, Arden comes to her aid where the two leave to Emily's grandfather's summerhouse, uncertain of their paths. After getting into a disagreement, Arden storms out of the home where Emily attempts to follow him, though meets her father instead unexpectedly. Emily confronts him with her feelings of abandonment, telling him, \"You said nothing could separate us. But you did,\" not understanding why he would intentionally shut her out as she exits and runs towards the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Emily leaps into the water where Arden retrieves her and pulls her to shore, expressing his feelings for her. Emily opens herself up to him and as the two head back towards the summerhouse, they make out in the bathroom. As Emily faces her father again wearing her mother's dress, she appears to forgive him and she agrees to return home to June while her father remains at the summerhouse. Emily's depression seems to lift as she faces the future more optimistically, running into the sea to greet Arden, smiling as he photographs her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Evanna Lynch]] as Emily\n* [[Michael Smiley]] as Robert\n* [[George Webster (actor)|George Webster]] as Arden\n* Sarah Minto as Young Emily\n* [[Deirdre Mullins]] as Emily's Mother\n* Declan Conlon as Arden's father\n* Ali White as Arden's Mother\n* Stella McCusker as Granny\n* [[Martin McCann (actor)|Martin McCann]] a Swimming Teacher\n* [[Cathy Belton]] as Greasy Haired Teacher\n* [[D\u00f3nall \u00d3 H\u00e9ala\u00ed]] as Young Policeman\n* [[Barry McGovern]] as Dr. Golding\n* Rebecca Hughes as Main Bully\n* Laura Matassa as Midwife\n* Ally Ni Chiarain as June\n\n==Production==\nFitzmaurice began writing the script shortly after his 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] premiere of his short film, ''The Sound of People'' and before he was diagnosed with [[Motor neuron disease]]; he learned of his illness the same day him and his wife, Ruth, a radio professional, discovered they were pregnant with their third child. Upon being completely paralyzed by the disease and expected to live for only four more years by his doctors, he completed the script using a Tobii eye gaze computer that monitors and translates the movement of his eyes into words and audio with the assistance of predictive text function.

Even the fact that he\u2019s the father of the philosopher and has all these crazy ideas and attracts this cultish following is very similar to [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] [Luna's father]. What attracts me to all characters is just authenticity and that boldness of self-expression, which I think they both do. Luna does it effortlessly in that she\u2019s who she is and she has no problem with that and she doesn\u2019t ever try to inhibit or change herself. And I think Emily is the same way, slightly more defiantly. I think Emily is a lot angrier at the world and sees so much fakery and pretension among her teenage peers, and I think she rebels against that by being so authentic and so true to herself. I just admire women like that because I, certainly growing up, felt unusual, felt odd, and felt I didn\u2019t really have a place where I fit.

Two years later, after having been hauled from one foster home to the next, including her uncle's where an older cousin of hers attempted to sexually abuse her from reading her father's novel on sex, Emily lives with June (Chiarain) and Steve (Loui Vangelder), foster parents she feels are not the worst but too suffocating, often rebuffing their attempts at kindness, notably June's. Emily feels June pressures her to be happy when she finds herself incapable of doing so due to her [[clinical depression]]. In the present, she often reflects on her happy earlier childhood (Millie Donnelly, Hunter and Sadie Fitzmaurice, Sarah Minto) with her father, her unconventional homeschooled education with him and how he changed dramatically after the death of her mother, also named Emily (Mullins) on the night of her birthday in a car accident, an event that led to his [[mental breakdown]]; he became obsessive with writing, refusing to eat and sleep and was preoccupied with the concept that humans and the surrounding universe, such as a blade of grass, shared the same molecules. As an ode to her mother, Emily dons an intricate bracelet she used to wear at all times.\n\nEmily is enrolled in a new secondary school and quickly attracts the attention of an awkward half-Irish, half-English classmate Arden (Webster) who is unrequitedly smitten with her, though she is initially standoffish and uninterested in his attempts of a relationship. Contrarily, Emily is outcast by her teachers and bullied by her peers (Hughes) for her oddity and intellectual arrogance, such as refusing to introduce herself on her first day and rebelling against an assignment to dissect a [[Woodsworth]] poem \"Ode on Intimations of Immortality\" for its obvious sexual message. On the day of her 16th birthday where Emily is troubled at the absence of a [[birthday card]] from her father, a tradition he has kept since his commitment, she contemplates [[suicide]] at the bottom of the school pool, much to the concern and frustration of her swimming teacher (McCann) who is forced to pull her to safety. Not comprehending her actions, she is further humiliated by her classmates as she is banned from class. Later that afternoon, Arden drops by her home to deliver a present, an old book handed down to him by his Irish grandmother (McCusker), [[Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Emily does not thank him, though accepts the gift.\n\nThereafter, she welcomes him accompanying her on their way home from school. When she returns home however, she grows upset at still finding that no letter from her father has arrived in the mail and despite June's assurance, she has an emotional meltdown. The next morning, she meets Arden at his home during a confrontation with his strict, physically abusive father (Conlon) and sensitive, submissive mother (White) and pleads for him to help her travel to the psychiatric institution and rescue Robert. At first reluctant, Arden eventually agrees as they both skip school. At first, they attempt to hitchhike in the rain with no luck until Arden enlists the help of his Granny to borrow her 70s canary-yellow [[Renault 4]]. After a full day on the road, on the following morning the two stop by a supermarket for breakfast, though Emily manipulates her way into only paying for a bouquet of flowers for Robert while shoplifting the rest, which upsets Arden given he would rather pay \"like normal people\" would, prompting Emily to justify that the money would be more useful towards border crossing and questions what it means to be \"normal.\"\n\nFollowing this incident, Emily grows paranoid of authority, believing they will attempt to stop her of reaching her destination and at one point, orders Arden to drive away from a curious policeman (\u00d3 H\u00e9alai) questioning them for IDs. Camping on the beach for the night, Emily and Arden are ambushed by a local gang. When Arden is beaten in an outnumbered fight and runs towards the car for help, Emily is left vulnerable inside the tent where she is threatened to be [[rape]]d by the gang's leader, telling him coldly, \"Fuck off.\" However, Arden returns having retrieved his deceased grandfather's handgun from the glove compartment, frightening the gang into submission as they flee. A mutual trust therein develops between Emily and Arden as they eventually arrive at the institution.\n\nArden invents a theatrical distraction atop the roof of one of the buildings, entertaining the patients whilst alarming the orderlies as Emily, bouquet in hand, searches for Robert. Coming upon his room however, she finds not her father but Dr. Golding (McGovern) who quietly informs her that her father is no longer at the facility. Inviting her to his office, he explains to her that the hospital does not hold people against their will, that Robert, after sometime, voluntarily admitted himself, a fact that greatly upsets Emily. Destroying the flowers outside, Arden comes to her aid where the two leave to Emily's grandfather's summerhouse, uncertain of their paths. After getting into a disagreement, Arden storms out of the home where Emily attempts to follow him, though meets her father instead unexpectedly. Emily confronts him with her feelings of abandonment, telling him, \"You said nothing could separate us. But you did,\" not understanding why he would intentionally shut her out as she exits and runs towards the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Emily leaps into the water where Arden retrieves her and pulls her to shore, expressing his feelings for her. Emily opens herself up to him and as the two head back towards the summerhouse, they make out in the bathroom. As Emily faces her father again wearing her mother's dress, she appears to forgive him and she agrees to return home to June while her father remains at the summerhouse. Emily's depression seems to lift as she faces the future more optimistically, running into the sea to greet Arden, smiling as he photographs her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Evanna Lynch]] as Emily\n* [[Michael Smiley]] as Robert\n* [[George Webster (actor)|George Webster]] as Arden\n* Sarah Minto as Young Emily\n* [[Deirdre Mullins]] as Emily's Mother\n* Declan Conlon as Arden's father\n* Ali White as Arden's Mother\n* Stella McCusker as Granny\n* [[Martin McCann (actor)|Martin McCann]] a Swimming Teacher\n* [[Cathy Belton]] as Greasy Haired Teacher\n* [[D\u00f3nall \u00d3 H\u00e9ala\u00ed]] as Young Policeman\n* [[Barry McGovern]] as Dr. Golding\n* Rebecca Hughes as Main Bully\n* Laura Matassa as Midwife\n* Ally Ni Chiarain as June\n\n==Production==\nFitzmaurice began writing the script shortly after his 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] premiere of his short film, ''The Sound of People'' and before he was diagnosed with [[Motor neuron disease]]; he learned of his illness the same day him and his wife, Ruth, a radio professional, discovered they were pregnant with their third child. Upon being completely paralyzed by the disease and expected to live for only four more years by his doctors, he completed the script using a Tobii eye gaze computer that monitors and translates the movement of his eyes into words and audio with the assistance of predictive text function. In order to raise production costs for the film, on 8 November 2013, producers set up a thirty-day crowd funding campaign on Indiegogo.

Even the fact that he\u2019s the father of the philosopher and has all these crazy ideas and attracts this cultish following is very similar to [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] [Luna's father]. What attracts me to all characters is just authenticity and that boldness of self-expression, which I think they both do. Luna does it effortlessly in that she\u2019s who she is and she has no problem with that and she doesn\u2019t ever try to inhibit or change herself. And I think Emily is the same way, slightly more defiantly. I think Emily is a lot angrier at the world and sees so much fakery and pretension among her teenage peers, and I think she rebels against that by being so authentic and so true to herself. I just admire women like that because I, certainly growing up, felt unusual, felt odd, and felt I didn\u2019t really have a place where I fit. But I always felt uncomfortable like that, and those women, like Emily and like Luna, they give me the confidence to just fit in that uncomfortable space.<ref>[http://www.mugglenet.com/2017/02/evanna-lynch-talks-with-mugglenet-about-being-true-to-ones-self/ Evanna Lynch Talks with MuggleNet About Being True to One's Self.] ''[[MuggleNet]].'' 11 February 2017.

They help extend shelf life, monitor freshness, display information on quality, improve safety, and improve [[convenience]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Dainelli\n | first =D\n | author2= Nathalie Gontard |author3=Dimitrios Spyropoulos |author4=Esther Zondervan-van den Beuken |author5=Paul Tobback\n | title = Active and intelligent food packaging: legal aspects and safety concerns\n | journal = Trends in Food Science & Technology\n | volume =19\n | issue =1\n | pages = 167\u2013177\n | date =2008\n| doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2008.09.011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe terms are closely related. ''Active packaging'' usually means having active functions beyond the inert passive containment and protection of the product.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Illustrated Glossary of Packaging Terms\n | author = Soroka, W\n | publisher = Institute of Packaging Professionals\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 978-1-930268-27-2\n | page = 3\n}}</ref>    ''Intelligent'' and ''smart'' packaging usually involve the ability to sense or measure an attribute of the product, the inner atmosphere of the package, or the shipping environment.  This information can be communicated to users or can trigger active packaging functions.  [[Programmable matter]], [[smart material]]s, etc. can be employed in packages.\n\nDepending on the working definitions, some traditional types of packaging might be considered as \"active\" or \"intelligent\".  More often, the terms are used with new technologically advanced systems: [[microelectronics]], [[computer applications]], [[nanotechnology]], etc.\n\n==Moisture control==\n\n{{main|Desiccant}}\n\nFor many years, desiccants have been used to control the water vapor in a closed package.  A desiccant is a hygroscopic substance usually in a porous pouch or [[Sachet (package)|sachet]] which is placed inside a sealed package.  They have been used to reduce corrosion of machinery and electronics and to extend the [[shelf life]] of moisture-sensitive foods and drugs.\n\n==Corrosion==\n[[Corrosion inhibitor]]s can be applied to items to help prevent [[rust]] and [[corrosion]].  [[Volatile corrosion inhibitor]]s (VCI) or vapor phase corrosion inhibitors can be provided inside a package in a pouch or can be incorporated in a saturated overwrap of special paper. Many of these are [[Salt (chemistry)|organic salt]]s that condense on the metal to resist corrosion. Some films also have VCI emitting capability.\n\nFilms are available with copper ions in the polymer structure,  These neutralize the corrosive gas in a package and deter rust.\n\nVCIs create a neutral environment in the packaging. It works on the principle of difference in [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] and causes reaction with metals and non-metals, and with moisture to prevent corrosion. There are different forms of VCIs available, such as papers, [[plastic]]s, [[HDPE]] papers, oils, [[foam]]s, chips, [[aluminum foil|aluminum barrier foils]], [[bubble wrap|bubble]], and emitters that can prevent corrosion at many stages.\n\n== Metal chelation ==\n[[File:Conceptual illustration of metal-chelating active packaging technology.jpg|thumb|350x350px|\nSynthesis of Iminodiacetate Functionalized Polypropylene Films and Their Efficacy as Antioxidant Active-Packaging Materials<ref name=\"Lin et al\">{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Zhuangsheng|last2=Roman|first2=Maxine J.|last3=Decker|first3=Eric A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Julie M.|date=2016-06-08|title=Synthesis of Iminodiacetate Functionalized Polypropylene Films and Their Efficacy as Antioxidant Active-Packaging Materials|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=64|issue=22|pages=4606\u20134617|doi=10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01128|pmid=27243793|issn=0021-8561}}</ref>\n]]\n[[trace element|Trace]] [[transition metal]]s in foods, especially [[iron]], can induce [[oxidative degradation]] of many food components, especially lipids, and cause quality changes of the products. Metal-[[chelating]] active packaging materials are made by immobilizing metal-chelating active compounds onto traditional active packaging material. The surface immobilized metal-chelating compounds can scavenge the transition metals from the product and enhance the [[oxidative stability]] of the product.<ref name=\"Lin et al\" /> The metal-chelating active packaging technology is also [[antioxidant]] active packaging that will extend the shelf-life of consumer products by controlling the oxidation. The metal-chelating active packaging technology is known to be able to remove synthetic food preservatives (e.g. [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]]) from the food product. This technology can be used to address the increasing consumer demand for additive free and 'clean' label food products.\n\n==Oxygen control==\n\n[[Oxygen scavenger]]s or oxygen absorbers help remove oxygen from a closed package.  Some are small packets or sachets containing powdered iron: as the iron rusts, oxygen is removed from the surrounding atmosphere.  Newer systems are on cards or can be built into package films or molded structures.<ref>{{cite patent\n | inventor-last = Katsumoto\n | inventor-first= Kiyoshi\n| date = 26 Aug, 1997\n | issue-date =\n | title = Oxygen scavenging layer consisting of oxidizable compound, second, separate layer consisting of oxidation catalyst\n | country-code =US\n | description = \n | patent-number = US 5660761 A\n| url = http://www.google.com/patents/US5660761\n| accessdate = 11 June 2014}}</ref>\nIn addition, the physical characteristics of the packaging itself ([[oxygen transmission rate]] - OTR) can dictate how effective an oxygen absorber can be, and how long it will stay effective. Packaging with a low OTR will let less oxygen in the closed package through the polymer barrier itself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cichello|first=Simon|title=A Guide to Oxygen Absorbers|url=http://www.oxygenabsorber.net/Oxygen%20Absorbers%20Introduction.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827025205/http://www.oxygenabsorber.net/Oxygen%20Absorbers%20Introduction.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==Atmosphere==\n{{main|Modified atmosphere|Modified atmosphere/modified humidity packaging}}\nWith some products, such as [[cheese]], it has long been common to flush the package with [[nitrogen]] prior to sealing: the [[chemically inert|inert]] nitrogen is absorbed into the cheese, allowing a tight [[shrink film]] package. The nitrogen removes oxygen and interacts with the cheese to make the package functional.\n\nMore recently, other mixtures of gas have been used inside the package to extend the shelf life.  The gas mixture depends on the specific product and its degradation mechanisms.  Some package components have been developed that incorporate active chemistry to help maintain certain atmospheres in packages.\n\n[[Oxygen scavenger]]s, [[carbon dioxide generator]]s, ethanol generators, etc. are available to help keep the atmosphere in a package at specified conditions.\n\n==Temperature monitor==\nSome temperature indicators give a visual signal that a specified temperature has been exceeded.  Others, [[Time temperature indicator]]s, signal when a critical accumulation of temperature deviation over time has been exceeded.  When the mechanism of the indicator is tuned to the mechanism of product degradation, these can provide valuable signals for consumers.\n\nDigital [[temperature data logger]]s record the temperatures encountered throughout the shipment.  This data can be used to predict product degradation and help determine if the product is suited for normal sale or if expedited sale is required.  They also determine the time of the temperature excess: this can be used to direct corrective action.\n\n[[Thermochromic ink]]s are sometimes used to signal temperature excess or change.  Some are reversible while others have a permanent change of color. These can be used alone or with other packaging functions such as [[barcode]]s.\n\nThe inks can also signal a desired temperature for consumers.  For example, one type of beer can has ink that graphically shows when an ideal drinking temperature is achieved.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Lingle\n | first = R\n | title = Coors' label shows beer temperature\n | website = \n | publisher = Packaging World\n | date = June 2007\n | url = http://www.packworld.com/package-23406\n | format = \n | doi = \n | accessdate = 8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100311074544/http://www.packworld.com/package-23406| url-status=live| archive-date = 2010-03-11\n }}</ref>\n\n==Controlling package temperatures==\n[[File:Army.mil-2008-03-06-232636.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Self-heating [[field ration]]s for up to 18 soldiers]]\nFor critical vaccines, [[insulated shipping container]]s are passive packaging to help control the temperatures fluctuations seen even with a controlled [[cold chain]].  In addition, gel packs are often used to keep the temperature of the contents within specified acceptable temperature ranges.\n\nSome newer packages have the ability to heat or cool the product for the consumer.  These have segregated compartments where exothermic or endothermic reactions provide the desired effect.<ref>{{Cite web\n |last= \n |first= \n |authorlink= \n |title=Self-heating can \n |website= \n |publisher=Stress Engineering \n |year=2010 \n |url=http://www.stress.com/consumertier3.php?pid=307 \n |format= \n |doi= \n |accessdate=8 April 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154215/http://www.stress.com/consumertier3.php?pid=307 \n|archive-date= 2011-07-16\n }}</ref>\n[[Self-heating can]]s are available for several products.\n\n==Dispensing==\n\nSome packages have [[Closure (container)|closures]] or other dispensing systems that change the contents from a liquid to an [[aerosol]].  These are used for products ranging from precision [[inhaler]]s for medications to spray bottles of household cleaners.\n\nSome dispensing packages for two-part [[epoxy]] adhesives do more than passively contain the two components.  When dispensed, some packages meter and mix the two components so the adhesive is fully functioning at the point of application.\n\nThe ability of a package to fully empty or dispense a viscous liquid is somewhat dependent on the  [[surface energy]] of the inner walls of the container.  The use of [[superhydrophobic]] surfaces is useful but can be further  improved  by using new lubricant-impregnated surfaces.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Smith\n | first =J D\n | first2= Rajeev |last2=Dhiman |first3=Sushant |last3=Anand |first4=Ernesto |last4=Reza-Garduno |first5=Robert E. |last5=Cohen |first6=Gareth H. |last6=McKinley |first7=Kripa K. |last7=Varanasi \n | title = Droplet mobility on lubricant-impregnated surfaces\n | journal = Soft Matter\n | volume =9\n | issue =6\n | pages = 1772\u20131780\n | date =2013\n|doi=10.1039/c2sm27032c \n| hdl =1721.1/79068\n |hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==RFID==\n[[File:Faltschachteln mit integriertem RFID-Tag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|RFID chip built into drug package]]\n[[Radio-frequency identification]] chips are becoming more common with the introduction of [[smart label]]s that are used to [[track and trace]] packages and [[unit load]]s throughout distribution.

They help extend shelf life, monitor freshness, display information on quality, improve safety, and improve [[convenience]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Dainelli\n | first =D\n | author2= Nathalie Gontard |author3=Dimitrios Spyropoulos |author4=Esther Zondervan-van den Beuken |author5=Paul Tobback\n | title = Active and intelligent food packaging: legal aspects and safety concerns\n | journal = Trends in Food Science & Technology\n | volume =19\n | issue =1\n | pages = 167\u2013177\n | date =2008\n| doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2008.09.011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe terms are closely related. ''Active packaging'' usually means having active functions beyond the inert passive containment and protection of the product.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Illustrated Glossary of Packaging Terms\n | author = Soroka, W\n | publisher = Institute of Packaging Professionals\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 978-1-930268-27-2\n | page = 3\n}}</ref>    ''Intelligent'' and ''smart'' packaging usually involve the ability to sense or measure an attribute of the product, the inner atmosphere of the package, or the shipping environment.  This information can be communicated to users or can trigger active packaging functions.  [[Programmable matter]], [[smart material]]s, etc. can be employed in packages.\n\nDepending on the working definitions, some traditional types of packaging might be considered as \"active\" or \"intelligent\".  More often, the terms are used with new technologically advanced systems: [[microelectronics]], [[computer applications]], [[nanotechnology]], etc.\n\n==Moisture control==\n\n{{main|Desiccant}}\n\nFor many years, desiccants have been used to control the water vapor in a closed package.  A desiccant is a hygroscopic substance usually in a porous pouch or [[Sachet (package)|sachet]] which is placed inside a sealed package.  They have been used to reduce corrosion of machinery and electronics and to extend the [[shelf life]] of moisture-sensitive foods and drugs.\n\n==Corrosion==\n[[Corrosion inhibitor]]s can be applied to items to help prevent [[rust]] and [[corrosion]].  [[Volatile corrosion inhibitor]]s (VCI) or vapor phase corrosion inhibitors can be provided inside a package in a pouch or can be incorporated in a saturated overwrap of special paper. Many of these are [[Salt (chemistry)|organic salt]]s that condense on the metal to resist corrosion. Some films also have VCI emitting capability.\n\nFilms are available with copper ions in the polymer structure,  These neutralize the corrosive gas in a package and deter rust.\n\nVCIs create a neutral environment in the packaging. It works on the principle of difference in [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] and causes reaction with metals and non-metals, and with moisture to prevent corrosion. There are different forms of VCIs available, such as papers, [[plastic]]s, [[HDPE]] papers, oils, [[foam]]s, chips, [[aluminum foil|aluminum barrier foils]], [[bubble wrap|bubble]], and emitters that can prevent corrosion at many stages.\n\n== Metal chelation ==\n[[File:Conceptual illustration of metal-chelating active packaging technology.jpg|thumb|350x350px|\nSynthesis of Iminodiacetate Functionalized Polypropylene Films and Their Efficacy as Antioxidant Active-Packaging Materials<ref name=\"Lin et al\">{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Zhuangsheng|last2=Roman|first2=Maxine J.|last3=Decker|first3=Eric A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Julie M.|date=2016-06-08|title=Synthesis of Iminodiacetate Functionalized Polypropylene Films and Their Efficacy as Antioxidant Active-Packaging Materials|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=64|issue=22|pages=4606\u20134617|doi=10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01128|pmid=27243793|issn=0021-8561}}</ref>\n]]\n[[trace element|Trace]] [[transition metal]]s in foods, especially [[iron]], can induce [[oxidative degradation]] of many food components, especially lipids, and cause quality changes of the products. Metal-[[chelating]] active packaging materials are made by immobilizing metal-chelating active compounds onto traditional active packaging material. The surface immobilized metal-chelating compounds can scavenge the transition metals from the product and enhance the [[oxidative stability]] of the product.<ref name=\"Lin et al\" /> The metal-chelating active packaging technology is also [[antioxidant]] active packaging that will extend the shelf-life of consumer products by controlling the oxidation. The metal-chelating active packaging technology is known to be able to remove synthetic food preservatives (e.g. [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]]) from the food product. This technology can be used to address the increasing consumer demand for additive free and 'clean' label food products.\n\n==Oxygen control==\n\n[[Oxygen scavenger]]s or oxygen absorbers help remove oxygen from a closed package.  Some are small packets or sachets containing powdered iron: as the iron rusts, oxygen is removed from the surrounding atmosphere.  Newer systems are on cards or can be built into package films or molded structures.<ref>{{cite patent\n | inventor-last = Katsumoto\n | inventor-first= Kiyoshi\n| date = 26 Aug, 1997\n | issue-date =\n | title = Oxygen scavenging layer consisting of oxidizable compound, second, separate layer consisting of oxidation catalyst\n | country-code =US\n | description = \n | patent-number = US 5660761 A\n| url = http://www.google.com/patents/US5660761\n| accessdate = 11 June 2014}}</ref>\nIn addition, the physical characteristics of the packaging itself ([[oxygen transmission rate]] - OTR) can dictate how effective an oxygen absorber can be, and how long it will stay effective. Packaging with a low OTR will let less oxygen in the closed package through the polymer barrier itself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cichello|first=Simon|title=A Guide to Oxygen Absorbers|url=http://www.oxygenabsorber.net/Oxygen%20Absorbers%20Introduction.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827025205/http://www.oxygenabsorber.net/Oxygen%20Absorbers%20Introduction.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==Atmosphere==\n{{main|Modified atmosphere|Modified atmosphere/modified humidity packaging}}\nWith some products, such as [[cheese]], it has long been common to flush the package with [[nitrogen]] prior to sealing: the [[chemically inert|inert]] nitrogen is absorbed into the cheese, allowing a tight [[shrink film]] package. The nitrogen removes oxygen and interacts with the cheese to make the package functional.\n\nMore recently, other mixtures of gas have been used inside the package to extend the shelf life.  The gas mixture depends on the specific product and its degradation mechanisms.  Some package components have been developed that incorporate active chemistry to help maintain certain atmospheres in packages.\n\n[[Oxygen scavenger]]s, [[carbon dioxide generator]]s, ethanol generators, etc. are available to help keep the atmosphere in a package at specified conditions.\n\n==Temperature monitor==\nSome temperature indicators give a visual signal that a specified temperature has been exceeded.  Others, [[Time temperature indicator]]s, signal when a critical accumulation of temperature deviation over time has been exceeded.  When the mechanism of the indicator is tuned to the mechanism of product degradation, these can provide valuable signals for consumers.\n\nDigital [[temperature data logger]]s record the temperatures encountered throughout the shipment.  This data can be used to predict product degradation and help determine if the product is suited for normal sale or if expedited sale is required.  They also determine the time of the temperature excess: this can be used to direct corrective action.\n\n[[Thermochromic ink]]s are sometimes used to signal temperature excess or change.  Some are reversible while others have a permanent change of color. These can be used alone or with other packaging functions such as [[barcode]]s.\n\nThe inks can also signal a desired temperature for consumers.  For example, one type of beer can has ink that graphically shows when an ideal drinking temperature is achieved.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Lingle\n | first = R\n | title = Coors' label shows beer temperature\n | website = \n | publisher = Packaging World\n | date = June 2007\n | url = http://www.packworld.com/package-23406\n | format = \n | doi = \n | accessdate = 8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100311074544/http://www.packworld.com/package-23406| url-status=live| archive-date = 2010-03-11\n }}</ref>\n\n==Controlling package temperatures==\n[[File:Army.mil-2008-03-06-232636.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Self-heating [[field ration]]s for up to 18 soldiers]]\nFor critical vaccines, [[insulated shipping container]]s are passive packaging to help control the temperatures fluctuations seen even with a controlled [[cold chain]].  In addition, gel packs are often used to keep the temperature of the contents within specified acceptable temperature ranges.\n\nSome newer packages have the ability to heat or cool the product for the consumer.  These have segregated compartments where exothermic or endothermic reactions provide the desired effect.<ref>{{Cite web\n |last= \n |first= \n |authorlink= \n |title=Self-heating can \n |website= \n |publisher=Stress Engineering \n |year=2010 \n |url=http://www.stress.com/consumertier3.php?pid=307 \n |format= \n |doi= \n |accessdate=8 April 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154215/http://www.stress.com/consumertier3.php?pid=307 \n|archive-date= 2011-07-16\n }}</ref>\n[[Self-heating can]]s are available for several products.\n\n==Dispensing==\n\nSome packages have [[Closure (container)|closures]] or other dispensing systems that change the contents from a liquid to an [[aerosol]].  These are used for products ranging from precision [[inhaler]]s for medications to spray bottles of household cleaners.\n\nSome dispensing packages for two-part [[epoxy]] adhesives do more than passively contain the two components.  When dispensed, some packages meter and mix the two components so the adhesive is fully functioning at the point of application.\n\nThe ability of a package to fully empty or dispense a viscous liquid is somewhat dependent on the  [[surface energy]] of the inner walls of the container.  The use of [[superhydrophobic]] surfaces is useful but can be further  improved  by using new lubricant-impregnated surfaces.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Smith\n | first =J D\n | first2= Rajeev |last2=Dhiman |first3=Sushant |last3=Anand |first4=Ernesto |last4=Reza-Garduno |first5=Robert E. |last5=Cohen |first6=Gareth H. |last6=McKinley |first7=Kripa K. |last7=Varanasi \n | title = Droplet mobility on lubricant-impregnated surfaces\n | journal = Soft Matter\n | volume =9\n | issue =6\n | pages = 1772\u20131780\n | date =2013\n|doi=10.1039/c2sm27032c \n| hdl =1721.1/79068\n |hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==RFID==\n[[File:Faltschachteln mit integriertem RFID-Tag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|RFID chip built into drug package]]\n[[Radio-frequency identification]] chips are becoming more common with the introduction of [[smart label]]s that are used to [[track and trace]] packages and [[unit load]]s throughout distribution.

RFID chips are being used in this application also.\n\n[[Electronic article surveillance]] (on the product or on the package) is used to help counter shoplifting.\n\n==Microwave packaging==\n[[Metallised film]]s are used as a [[susceptor]] for cooking in [[microwave oven]]s.

The Saints will be looking to end a 6-year silverware drought this season by competing for the [[Super League XIX]] title as well as the 113th edition of the [[Challenge Cup]]. This season marks Australian [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]]'s second season as head coach of the club, continuing from his first season in 2013 which ended in a 5th-place finish and an early playoff exit courtesy of an 11\u201310 defeat at [[Leeds Rhinos]]. They began their season by taking on last seasons runner-up [[Warrington Wolves]] at the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]], which ended in an 8\u201338 win for Saints. This win sent Saints on a win streak that lasted for eight Super League games before being defeated on 18 April 2014 by arch-rivals [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Langtree Park]] in the annual Good Friday derby match. Easter was a period to forget for the Saints as they were beaten by [[Widnes Vikings]] for their second league defeat in a row, following the Good Friday defeat to bitter rivals Wigan, and then by [[Leeds Rhinos]] in Round 5 of the Challenge Cup meaning the Saints will miss out on the trophy for a sixth year. The Saints bounced back however on 1 May with a 48\u201318 win over the [[London Broncos]]. Saints suffered another Magic Weekend to the [[Warrington Wolves]] on 18 May with the game ending 41\u201324 to the Wolves. Results picked up after the Magic Weekend with two straight wins at home against [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] & [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] however the Saints then traveled to Perpignan where they suffered a humiliating 42\u20130 loss to the [[Catalans Dragons]]. Once again, the Saints bounced back with an impressive win over [[Castleford Tigers]] at Langtree Park and with another outstanding performance in a pulsating game at the [[DW Stadium]] against arch-rivals [[Wigan Warriors]] that ended 12\u201316 in favour of the Saints; the win avenging the Good Friday defeat at Langtree Park. Following this win, Saints suffered a shock 40\u201310 defeat to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] but bounced back with three straight wins before losing to Hull KR's cross-town rivals, [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]], 19\u201312. However, a 40\u201316 win over [[Wakefield Trinity|Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]] & an extremely tight 12\u201313 win over [[Leeds Rhinos]] at Headingly put the Saints in a position where a win against Warrington on 4 September would hand them their first [[League Leaders' Shield]] since the 2008 season; with [[Castleford Tigers]] being the only other team in contention for the top spot. Despite losing their last two games of the regular season, Saints acquired the League Leaders' Shield following [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford's]] failure to beat [[Catalans Dragons]] in their last game of the season; meaning that the Saints took their first piece of silverware since 2008.

The Saints will be looking to end a 6-year silverware drought this season by competing for the [[Super League XIX]] title as well as the 113th edition of the [[Challenge Cup]]. This season marks Australian [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]]'s second season as head coach of the club, continuing from his first season in 2013 which ended in a 5th-place finish and an early playoff exit courtesy of an 11\u201310 defeat at [[Leeds Rhinos]]. They began their season by taking on last seasons runner-up [[Warrington Wolves]] at the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]], which ended in an 8\u201338 win for Saints. This win sent Saints on a win streak that lasted for eight Super League games before being defeated on 18 April 2014 by arch-rivals [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Langtree Park]] in the annual Good Friday derby match. Easter was a period to forget for the Saints as they were beaten by [[Widnes Vikings]] for their second league defeat in a row, following the Good Friday defeat to bitter rivals Wigan, and then by [[Leeds Rhinos]] in Round 5 of the Challenge Cup meaning the Saints will miss out on the trophy for a sixth year. The Saints bounced back however on 1 May with a 48\u201318 win over the [[London Broncos]]. Saints suffered another Magic Weekend to the [[Warrington Wolves]] on 18 May with the game ending 41\u201324 to the Wolves. Results picked up after the Magic Weekend with two straight wins at home against [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] & [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] however the Saints then traveled to Perpignan where they suffered a humiliating 42\u20130 loss to the [[Catalans Dragons]]. Once again, the Saints bounced back with an impressive win over [[Castleford Tigers]] at Langtree Park and with another outstanding performance in a pulsating game at the [[DW Stadium]] against arch-rivals [[Wigan Warriors]] that ended 12\u201316 in favour of the Saints; the win avenging the Good Friday defeat at Langtree Park. Following this win, Saints suffered a shock 40\u201310 defeat to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] but bounced back with three straight wins before losing to Hull KR's cross-town rivals, [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]], 19\u201312. However, a 40\u201316 win over [[Wakefield Trinity|Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]] & an extremely tight 12\u201313 win over [[Leeds Rhinos]] at Headingly put the Saints in a position where a win against Warrington on 4 September would hand them their first [[League Leaders' Shield]] since the 2008 season; with [[Castleford Tigers]] being the only other team in contention for the top spot. Despite losing their last two games of the regular season, Saints acquired the League Leaders' Shield following [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford's]] failure to beat [[Catalans Dragons]] in their last game of the season; meaning that the Saints took their first piece of silverware since 2008. The unlikely success of the 2014 season culminated in a 14\u20136 win over arch-rivals [[Wigan Warriors]] in the [[2014 Super League Grand Final]] at [[Old Trafford]] making Saints the Super League champions for the first time since 2006 in an extremely lively, well-fought contest that saw Wigan player [[Ben Flower]] sent off for a sucker punch on a defenceless [[Lance Hohaia]] in the 2nd minute of the game.<ref>{{citeweb|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/11156623/St-Helens-14-Wigan-Warriors-6-Moment-of-madness-from-Wales-international-Ben-Flower-costs-Wigan-dear.html|title= St Helens 14 Wigan Warriors 6: Moment of madness from Wales international Ben Flower costs Wigan dear|date= 11 October 2014 |work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==2014 transfers==\n\n'''Players In'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:65%; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

They looked to improve upon their 3\u201313 season the year before, and did so after defeating the [[2012 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] in Week 5; their win over the [[2012 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] in Week 16 made this their first winning season since [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|2009]]. The Vikings also made the playoffs for the first time since 2009 with a Week 17 win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] to give them a 10\u20136 regular season record, but were defeated by the same opponents in the Wild Card playoff round the following week. [[Adrian Peterson]] was named the league's [[Most Valuable Player]] after rushing for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of breaking the single-season record held by [[Eric Dickerson]] since [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nOn May 10, 2012, the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] approved a bill for a new stadium for the team that would see a new facility (later named [[U.S. Bank Stadium]]) constructed by 2016 and ensure the Vikings' presence in [[Minneapolis]] through the year 2046.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Minnesota Vikings stadium law heads to governor amid questions over state's financing |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-minnesota-vikings-stadium-law-heads-to-governor-amid-questions-over-states-financing/ |website=CBSNews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> The bill was signed by Governor [[Mark Dayton]] on May 14,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dayton Signs $975M Vikings Stadium Bill |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/14/dayton-to-sign-975m-vikings-stadium-bill/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref> and approved by the [[Minneapolis City Council]] by a vote of 7\u20136 on May 25.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederick |last=Melo |title=Vikings stadium wins Minneapolis City Council's final approval |url=https://www.twincities.com/2012/05/24/vikings-stadium-wins-minneapolis-city-councils-final-approval/ |website=TwinCities.com |publisher=Digital First Media |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=City Council's Final Vote In Favor Of Stadium, 7-6 |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/05/25/mpls-city-council-makes-final-stadium-vote-friday/ |work=CBS Minnesota |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\n[[File:Adrian Peterson broke Vikings franchise rushing record.jpg|thumb|Adrian Peterson rushed to a new career franchise record against Jacksonville in week 1, overtaking [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]]'s 6,818 rushing yards]]\n\n===Pre-draft transactions===\nThe first major transactions of the 2012 offseason were the releases of veteran guards [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]] and [[Anthony Herrera (American football)|Anthony Herrera]], and CB [[Cedric Griffin]] on March 10, as the Vikings began rebuilding their offensive line and secondary. Three days later, the team re-signed perennial backup QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] and DT [[Letroy Guion]] off their unrestricted free agents list. This was followed up with the signing of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' unrestricted free agent TE [[John Carlson (American football)|John Carlson]] on a five-year contract.\n\nThe next week, the team brought in FB [[Jerome Felton]], also an unrestricted free agent, from the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. They then released DT [[Remi Ayodele]] on March 21, but re-signed DT [[Fred Evans (defensive tackle)|Fred Evans]]. March 26 was a big day for signings by the Vikings, with the re-signings of WR [[Devin Aromashodu]] and LB [[Erin Henderson]], as well as the free agent acquisitions of CB [[Zack Bowman]] from the [[Chicago Bears]] and T [[Geoff Schwartz]] from the [[Carolina Panthers]].\n\nApril saw very few transactions go through in anticipation of the [[2012 NFL Draft]] at the end of the month. Nevertheless, the Vikings signed LB [[Marvin Mitchell]] and WR [[Jerome Simpson]], despite the fact that Simpson would miss the first three games of the season for a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\n===Draft===\n{{main|2012 NFL draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|[[Pro Bowl]]er\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The Vikings also made the playoffs for the first time since 2009 with a Week 17 win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] to give them a 10\u20136 regular season record, but were defeated by the same opponents in the Wild Card playoff round the following week.

Three days later, the team re-signed perennial backup QB [[Sage Rosenfels]] and DT [[Letroy Guion]] off their unrestricted free agents list. This was followed up with the signing of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' unrestricted free agent TE [[John Carlson (American football)|John Carlson]] on a five-year contract.\n\nThe next week, the team brought in FB [[Jerome Felton]], also an unrestricted free agent, from the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. They then released DT [[Remi Ayodele]] on March 21, but re-signed DT [[Fred Evans (defensive tackle)|Fred Evans]]. March 26 was a big day for signings by the Vikings, with the re-signings of WR [[Devin Aromashodu]] and LB [[Erin Henderson]], as well as the free agent acquisitions of CB [[Zack Bowman]] from the [[Chicago Bears]] and T [[Geoff Schwartz]] from the [[Carolina Panthers]].\n\nApril saw very few transactions go through in anticipation of the [[2012 NFL Draft]] at the end of the month. Nevertheless, the Vikings signed LB [[Marvin Mitchell]] and WR [[Jerome Simpson]], despite the fact that Simpson would miss the first three games of the season for a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\n===Draft===\n{{main|2012 NFL draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|[[Pro Bowl]]er\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161' work bears a distinct [[Romantic music|romantic]] character, with a strong trend towards [[Nationalism (music)|national]] themes. His main musical authorities and influences were [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Jean Sibelius]]. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 musical contribution is mainly to [[vocal music]] ([[choral music|choral]] and [[art song]]s), but he also composed [[orchestra]]l music, though only one piece, \"Melanholiskais valsis\" (Melancholic waltz) has survived. His only [[opera]], \"Ro\u017eain\u0101s dienas\" (Rose days) remained unfinished after his early death at the age of 34.\n\n==Biography==\nD\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 was born on November 3, 1875, in a rural teacher's family. Both his parents were very musical and facilitated Em\u012bls's first musical education. His father, being an amateur musician and conductor of a local choir, taught his son to play the piano. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attachment to music became stronger after he almost lost his eyesight at the age of 3, as a result of overstraining it while reading. He was also diagnosed allergic to sunlight, so for 5 years he was living in a completely dark room. He could go back to normal life when he was eight. Since then he also was going to school.\n\nD\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 spent his childhood in the country and attended various local schools. During those years he became familiar with the music of [[Beethoven]] and [[Mozart]]. At the age of 16 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 moved to Riga, where he continued his studies in music and composed his first choral piece \"J\u016bs, kalni, j\u016bs, lejas\" (\"You, mountains, you, lowlands\"). This song received favourable mention from the well-known Latvian composer, [[J\u0101zeps V\u012btols]], who had been a pupil of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attendance at the 4th Latvian Song Festival in [[Jelgava]] finally strengthened his determination to become a musician.\n\nIn 1897 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 began study at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but was forced to leave because of an abrupt sickness. He finally entered [[St Petersburg Conservatory]], in the organ class. Due to financial hardship D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 was forced to give music lessons, yet that was not enough to cover his living expenses. In spring 1901, not having finished his studies, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 returned to Riga where he started to work as a music critic, teacher, choir conductor and pianist. \"To work for my nation and its art - that will be my motto!\" - he wrote in one letter at that time.\n\nIn November 1903 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 married Marija Deidere, yet the marriage was not a happy one, partially due to endless material difficulties, also due to the composer's growing addiction to alcohol. The latter was apparently exacerbated by the especially hostile attitude that other Latvian musicians apparently displayed towards him. In 1906 their son [[Volfgangs D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161|Volfgangs]] was born.\n\nIn the beginning of 1908 two orchestral pieces by D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 were performed in Riga, yet these met with fierce negative criticism from other Latvian composers. P. Jurj\u0101ns called him \"a dilettante and a boasting critic\" and even accused him of plagiarism. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 objected and asked for an independent opinion of an authoritative professor [[Alexander Glazunov]], who found the criticisms unfounded. Yet Jurj\u0101ns had obtained a letter from [[Sibelius]] which apparently supported his biting criticism. Having received this strong moral blow, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 decided to destroy all his orchestral works.

D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161' work bears a distinct [[Romantic music|romantic]] character, with a strong trend towards [[Nationalism (music)|national]] themes. His main musical authorities and influences were [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Jean Sibelius]]. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 musical contribution is mainly to [[vocal music]] ([[choral music|choral]] and [[art song]]s), but he also composed [[orchestra]]l music, though only one piece, \"Melanholiskais valsis\" (Melancholic waltz) has survived. His only [[opera]], \"Ro\u017eain\u0101s dienas\" (Rose days) remained unfinished after his early death at the age of 34.\n\n==Biography==\nD\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 was born on November 3, 1875, in a rural teacher's family. Both his parents were very musical and facilitated Em\u012bls's first musical education. His father, being an amateur musician and conductor of a local choir, taught his son to play the piano. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attachment to music became stronger after he almost lost his eyesight at the age of 3, as a result of overstraining it while reading. He was also diagnosed allergic to sunlight, so for 5 years he was living in a completely dark room. He could go back to normal life when he was eight. Since then he also was going to school.\n\nD\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 spent his childhood in the country and attended various local schools. During those years he became familiar with the music of [[Beethoven]] and [[Mozart]]. At the age of 16 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 moved to Riga, where he continued his studies in music and composed his first choral piece \"J\u016bs, kalni, j\u016bs, lejas\" (You, mountains, you, lowlands). This song received favourable mention from the well-known Latvian composer, [[J\u0101zeps V\u012btols]], who had been a pupil of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attendance at the 4th Latvian Song Festival in [[Jelgava]] finally strengthened his determination to become a musician.\n\nIn 1897 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 began study at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but was forced to leave because of an abrupt sickness. He finally entered [[St Petersburg Conservatory]], in the organ class. Due to financial hardship D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 was forced to give music lessons, yet that was not enough to cover his living expenses. In spring 1901, not having finished his studies, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 returned to Riga where he started to work as a music critic, teacher, choir conductor and pianist. \"To work for my nation and its art - that will be my motto!\" - he wrote in one letter at that time.\n\nIn November 1903 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 married Marija Deidere, yet the marriage was not a happy one, partially due to endless material difficulties, also due to the composer's growing addiction to alcohol. The latter was apparently exacerbated by the especially hostile attitude that other Latvian musicians apparently displayed towards him. In 1906 their son [[Volfgangs D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161|Volfgangs]] was born.\n\nIn the beginning of 1908 two orchestral pieces by D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 were performed in Riga, yet these met with fierce negative criticism from other Latvian composers. P. Jurj\u0101ns called him \"a dilettante and a boasting critic\" and even accused him of plagiarism. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 objected and asked for an independent opinion of an authoritative professor [[Alexander Glazunov]], who found the criticisms unfounded. Yet Jurj\u0101ns had obtained a letter from [[Sibelius]] which apparently supported his biting criticism. Having received this strong moral blow, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 decided to destroy all his orchestral works. The well known \"Melanholiskais valsis (Melancholy waltz)\" was restored after his death. \n\nAt the end of the same year D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 started work on opera \"Ro\u017eain\u0101s dienas\", which, however, was left unfinished. The composer died on August 31, 1910, in an accident the causes of which are still the subject of controversy.
