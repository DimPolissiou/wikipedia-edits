The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open.

OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications.

An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open.
