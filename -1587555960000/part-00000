Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including on the surface of [[cereal|cereal grains]], so any dough left to rest leavens naturally.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harold| last=McGee | year=2004 | title=On food and cooking | publisher=Scribner | isbn=978-0-684-80001-1 |page=517}}</ref>\n\nThere were multiple sources of [[leavening]] available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that the [[Gauls]] and [[Iberians]] used the foam skimmed from [[beer]] called [[barm]] to produce \"a lighter kind of bread than other peoples\" such as [[barm cake]]. Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of [[grape]] juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in [[wine]], as a source for [[yeast]]. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough [[Bread starter|starter]], as Pliny also reported.<ref>{{cite book | first=Reay | last=Tannahill | year=1973 | title=Food in History | publisher=Stein and Day | isbn=978-0-8128-1437-8 |pages=68\u201369}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |date=1938 |publisher=Loeb Classics |pages=1.255 |url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL371.255.xml?readMode=recto |quote=Generally however they do not heat it up at all, but only use the dough kept over from the day before; manifestly it is natural for sourness to make the dough ferment}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chorleywood bread process]] was developed in 1961; it uses the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of grain with a lower protein content, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120522022319/http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipes/bread-making/chorleywood-process Chorleywood Industrial Bread Making Process]. allotment.org.uk</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-13670278 bbc.com: \"Chorleywood: The bread that changed Britain\"], 7 Jun 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.fob.uk.com/about-the-bread-industry/history-of-bread-antiquity/history-bread-20th-century/ fob.co.uk: \"History of bread \u2013 20th century\"]</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{main|List of breads}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=350\n|image1=Breadindia.jpg|caption1=Brown bread (left) and whole grain bread\n|image2=Essene Bread Spelt Sproud cut.JPG|caption2=Dark [[sprouted bread]]\n}}\nBread is the [[staple food]] of the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], and in European-derived cultures such as those in the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], and [[Southern Africa]], in contrast to parts of South and East Asia where [[rice]] or [[noodle]] is the staple.

The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours [[Farinograph#Method|absorb]] about 62% [[water]], while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Finley, John H. |author2=Phillips, R.

Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water.

Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The [[protein]] content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread [[dough]] and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12\u201314%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9\u201311%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamelman, Jeffrey  |title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7\u201313 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=978-0-471-16857-7 }}</ref>\n\nWheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups ([[albumin]], [[globulin]], and [[proteose]]s) and two water-insoluble protein groups ([[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by [[kneading]], or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see [[no-knead bread]]), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as [[gluten]]. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to [[autolyse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Gary |last2=Carey |first2=Patrick |last3=Tinton |first3=Terry |last4=Walpole |first4=Steven |title=Professional Chef: Level 2 Diploma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iGHqXWigQ4C&pg=RA17-PA10 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |isbn=978-1-84480-706-2 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Liquids===\nWater, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.

There are two common methods. The first is to use [[baking powder]] or a [[self-raising flour]] that includes baking powder.  The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as [[buttermilk]] and add [[baking soda]]; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas.<ref name=BAC/> Chemically leavened breads are called ''[[quick bread]]s'' and ''[[soda bread]]s''.

This yeast [[Fermentation|ferments]] some of the [[carbohydrate]]s in the flour, including any [[sugar]], producing [[carbon dioxide]]. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced [[baker's yeast]]. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a [[pure culture]].<ref name=BAC/> Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture.

Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to [[Proofing (baking technique)|rise]] one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often \"punch down\" the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an [[oven]].<ref name=BAC/>\n\nMany breads are made from a \"[[straight dough]]\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time;<ref name=BAC/> others are made from a \"[[pre-ferment]]\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: \"[[poolish]]\" or \"pouliche\", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); \"[[biga (bread baking)|biga]]\", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and \"p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e\", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisan bread baking tips: Poolish & biga|url=https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/more-artisan-bread-baking-tips-poolish-biga/|website=Weekend Bakery|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preferments|publisher=King Arthur Flour}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[File:Breaddough1.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (566 / 545)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough1.jpg]]\n| [[File:Breaddough2.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1942 / 1944)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough2.jpg]]\n| [[File:Risen bread dough in tin.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1752 / 1094)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ARisen%20bread%20dough%20in%20tin.jpg]]\n|-\n| Before first rising\n| After first rising\n| After [[proofing (baking technique)|proofing]], ready to bake\n|}</center>[[File:Sour dough loaves03.jpg|thumb|Sourdough loaves]]\n\n===Sourdough===\n{{Main|Sourdough}}\nSourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]].

The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough/> At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mesure|first1=Susie|title=Supermarkets cash in on sourdough bread craze as popularity surges |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supermarkets-cash-in-on-sourdough-bread-craze-as-popularity-surges-a6844101.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2016|date=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).<ref name=BAC/>\n\n===Steam===\nThe rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable.  Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edwards, W.P.|title=The science of bakery products |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |page=68 |isbn=978-0-85404-486-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&pg=PA68|quote=When bread expands in the oven the resulting expansion is known as oven spring.

The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours [[Farinograph#Method|absorb]] about 62% [[water]], while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Finley, John H. |author2=Phillips, R.

Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water.

Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The [[protein]] content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread [[dough]] and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12\u201314%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9\u201311%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamelman, Jeffrey  |title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7\u201313 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=978-0-471-16857-7 }}</ref>\n\nWheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups ([[albumin]], [[globulin]], and [[proteose]]s) and two water-insoluble protein groups ([[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by [[kneading]], or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see [[no-knead bread]]), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as [[gluten]]. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to [[autolyse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Gary |last2=Carey |first2=Patrick |last3=Tinton |first3=Terry |last4=Walpole |first4=Steven |title=Professional Chef: Level 2 Diploma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iGHqXWigQ4C&pg=RA17-PA10 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |isbn=978-1-84480-706-2 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Liquids===\nWater, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough.

They also help to hold the structure together. If too much fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect causes the protein structures to divide.

There are two common methods. The first is to use [[baking powder]] or a [[self-raising flour]] that includes baking powder.  The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as [[buttermilk]] and add [[baking soda]]; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas.<ref name=BAC/> Chemically leavened breads are called ''[[quick bread]]s'' and ''[[soda bread]]s''. This method is commonly used to make [[muffin]]s, [[pancake]]s, American-style [[biscuits]], and quick breads such as [[banana bread]].\n\n===Yeast===\n{{Main|Baker's yeast}}\n[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|Compressed fresh yeast]]\n\nMany breads are leavened by [[yeast]]. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast [[Fermentation|ferments]] some of the [[carbohydrate]]s in the flour, including any [[sugar]], producing [[carbon dioxide]]. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced [[baker's yeast]]. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a [[pure culture]].<ref name=BAC/> Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.<ref name=\"isbn0-387-38563-0-cite4\">{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-387-38563-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe baker's yeast and [[sourdough]] methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to [[Proofing (baking technique)|rise]] one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often \"punch down\" the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an [[oven]].<ref name=BAC/>\n\nMany breads are made from a \"[[straight dough]]\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time;<ref name=BAC/> others are made from a \"[[pre-ferment]]\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: \"[[poolish]]\" or \"pouliche\", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); \"[[biga (bread baking)|biga]]\", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and \"p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e\", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisan bread baking tips: Poolish & biga|url=https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/more-artisan-bread-baking-tips-poolish-biga/|website=Weekend Bakery|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preferments|publisher=King Arthur Flour}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[File:Breaddough1.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (566 / 545)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough1.jpg]]\n| [[File:Breaddough2.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1942 / 1944)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ABreaddough2.jpg]]\n| [[File:Risen bread dough in tin.jpg|{{#expr: (100 * (1752 / 1094)) round 0}}px|link=%3AFile%3ARisen%20bread%20dough%20in%20tin.jpg]]\n|-\n| Before first rising\n| After first rising\n| After [[proofing (baking technique)|proofing]], ready to bake\n|}</center>[[File:Sour dough loaves03.jpg|thumb|Sourdough loaves]]\n\n===Sourdough===\n{{Main|Sourdough}}\nSourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]]. It usually has a mildly sour taste because of the [[lactic acid]] produced during [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] [[fermentation]] by the lactobacilli.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough>{{cite book | first=Alan | last=Davidson | year=1999 | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/756 756\u201357] | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/756 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor1=Gobbetti, Marco |editor2=G\u00e4nzle, Michael |date=2012 |title=Handbook on Sourdough Biotechnology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4899-9189-8}}</ref>\n\nSourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter. The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough/> At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mesure|first1=Susie|title=Supermarkets cash in on sourdough bread craze as popularity surges |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supermarkets-cash-in-on-sourdough-bread-craze-as-popularity-surges-a6844101.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2016|date=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).<ref name=BAC/>\n\n===Steam===\nThe rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable.  Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edwards, W.P.|title=The science of bakery products |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |page=68 |isbn=978-0-85404-486-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&pg=PA68|quote=When bread expands in the oven the resulting expansion is known as oven spring.

Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO<sub>2</sub> generation is stopped.\n\n===Bacteria===\n[[Salt-rising bread]] employs a form of [[bacteria]]l leavening that does not require yeast. Although the leavening action is inconsistent, and requires close attention to the [[incubator (culture)|incubating]] conditions, this bread is making a comeback for its cheese-like flavor and fine texture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~petsonk/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630212428/http://home.comcast.net/~petsonk/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2012 |title=Susan R.

From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, bread made this way was somewhat popular in the United Kingdom, made by the [[Aerated Bread Company]] and sold in its high-street [[Aerated Bread Company#Tea shops and early women's issues|tearooms]].
