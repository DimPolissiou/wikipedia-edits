Her depictions of the terror after the fall of the city won her several major awards, including the Amnesty International Prize and Britain\u2019s Foreign Correspondent of the Year. <ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2000/01/bio-digiovanni</ref>\n\nDuring the war in Kosovo, di Giovanni traveled with the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] into occupied Kosovo and sustained a bombing raid on her unit which left many soldiers dead. Her article on that incident, and many of her other experiences during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkan Wars]], \"Madness Visible\" for ''Vanity Fair'' (2000), won the [[National Magazine Award]] for reporting.<ref name=\"magazine.org\" /> Her article was later expanded into a book for Knopf/Bloomsbury.\n\nIn 1999, she became a contributing editor to Vanity Fair <ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2000/01/bio-digiovanni</ref> and continued to report for both The Times and Vanity Fair in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as extensively in Africa - Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Somalia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda. Later, she reported the Arab Spring, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and finally Syria. Many of her early essays were then compiled in a book published by Bloomsbury, The Place at the End of the World. <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/14/highereducation.news</ref>\n\nIn 2010, di Giovanni was the President of the Jury of the [[Bayeux-Calvados Awards for war correspondents]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Janine di Giovanni, president of the jury |url=http://archives.prixbayeux.org/index.php?id=284&L=1 |publisher=[[Bayeux-Calvados Awards for war correspondents|Prix Bayeux-Calvados des correspondants de guerre]] |date=2010}}</ref> She was a participant in the 2013 World Economic Forum, Davos.\n\nIn 2013 di Giovanni joined Newsweek as Middle East Editor and began working primarily in the Syria, Egypt, Kurdistan, Lebanon and Iraq regions. She also continued to work in North Africa and in South Sudan. <ref>https://www.newsweek.com/authors/janine-di-giovanni}</ref>\n\nShe is a frequent moderator at the UN and the World Economic Forum, as well as the UNESCO and numerous other conferences. Di Giovanni\u2019s inaugural talk at TED, \"What I Saw in the War\" has garnered over 900,000 views.\n\nIn 2014 her article from Harper's Magazine, \"Life during Wartime,\" was chosen by the writer Paul Theroux as one of the essays included in The Best American Travel Writing.\n\nIn 2015, di Giovanni was awarded a Pakis Fellowship from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy to study International Law and Relations. She graduated in March 2016 after completing a thesis on Track II diplomacy in the Syrian civil war.\n\nShe has made two long format documentaries for the BBC. In 2000, she returned to [[Bosnia]] to make ''Lessons from History'', a report on five years of peace after the [[Dayton Accords]]. The following year she went to Jamaica to report on police assassinations of civilians, ''Dead Men Tell No Tales''.\n\nDi Giovanni was the subject of a documentary about women [[war reporters]], ''No Man's Land'' (1993) which followed her working in [[Sarajevo]]. She is one of the journalists featured in another documentary about women war reporters, ''[[Bearing Witness]]'' (2005), by [[Barbara Kopple]], which was shown at the Tribeca film festival and on the A&E network in May 2005.

The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]). In 2008, the NIST published the U.S. version ([http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (BIPM) publication {{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me International d' Unit\u00e9s (SI)}} ([http://www1.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8.pdf BIPM, 2006]).

The Director of the NIST officially recognized this publication, together with [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor and Thompson (2008b)], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).}}\n\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ({{val|0|u=degC}}). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1000&nbsp;litres of water has a mass of about 1000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show that it has a density of {{val|0.999975|0.000001|u=kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05).</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J. Gentry (2006), [http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/SP1038.pdf The International System of Units (SI) \u2013 Conversion Factors for General Use]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527160710/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/SP1038.pdf |date=27 May 2010 }}, NIST Special Publication 1038.</ref> There are two international standard symbols for the litre: L and l.

A [[mnemonic]] for its volume relative to an imperial pint is \"a litre of water's a pint and three quarters\"; this is very close, as a litre is actually 1.75975399&nbsp;pints.\n\nA litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10&nbsp;cm, which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4&nbsp;inches (one-third of a foot). One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27&nbsp;litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592&nbsp;litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27-litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter [[L#Forms_and_variants|\"l\"]]. In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]].</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton). In 1990, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre.<ref name=\"BIPM2006-brochure\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\nPrior to 1979, the symbol <span style=\"font-size:112%\">{{Litre}}</span> came into common use in some countries;{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} for example, it was recommended by [[South African Bureau of Standards]] publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s.

This made the original litre {{val|1.000974}} of today's cubic decimetre. It was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed.\n\nIn 1879, the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures|CIPM]] adopted the definition of the litre, with the symbol '''l''' (lowercase letter L).\n\nIn 1901, at the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1&nbsp;kg of pure [[water]] at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C) under a pressure of 1&nbsp;[[Standard atmospheric pressure|atm]]. This made the litre equal to about {{val|1.000028|u=dm3}} (earlier reference works usually put it at {{val|1.000027|u=dm3}}).\n\nIn 1964, at the 12th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the original definition was reverted to, and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre, as another name for the cubic decimetre, that is, exactly 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=NIST, 2000 |publisher=Ts.nist.gov |accessdate=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210164956/http://ts.nist.gov/weightsandmeasures/publications/appxc.cfm |archivedate=10 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, at the 16th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the alternative symbol '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted.

The abbreviation \"cc\" is still commonly used in many fields, including medical dosage and sizing for [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] [[engine displacement|displacement]].\n\nThe microlitre (\u03bcL) has been known in the past as the [[Lambda (unit)|lambda]] (\u03bb), but this usage is now discouraged.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carl A. |last1=Burtis |first2=David E. |last2=Bruns |year=2014 |title=Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics |edition=7. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323292061 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7XwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |pages=114}}</ref> In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as '''mcL''' on test results.<ref>{{cite web |title=Units of Measurement |url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/appendix/measurement.html |website=Mayo Medical Laboratories |accessdate=23 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[SI]] system, use of prefixes for powers of 1000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}<!-- is this true?? --> In countries where the [[metric system]] was established well before the adoption of the [[SI]] standard, other multiples were already established and their use remains common. In particular, use of the \"centi\" (10<sup>\u22122</sup>), \"deci\" (10<sup>\u22121</sup>), \"deca\" (10<sup>+1</sup>) and \"hecto\" (10<sup>+2</sup>) prefixes are still common.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of [[beverages]] (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in [[Switzerland]] and [[Scandinavia]] and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Belgium]], a \"{{lang|nl|vijfentwintiger}}\" and a \"{{lang|nl|drie\u00ebndertiger}}\" (literally \"twenty-fiver\" and \"thirty-threer\") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL and 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for \"artisanal\" brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the [[SI]] standard was established, common usage more closely follows contemporary [[SI]] conventions. For example, in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} An exception is in pathology, where for instance [[blood lead level]] may be measured in micrograms per decilitre.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1&nbsp;kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAlthough kilolitres, megalitres, and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, for larger volumes of fluids, such as annual consumption of tap water, lorry (truck) tanks, or swimming pools, the [[cubic metre]] is the general unit.

The spelling \"liter\" is predominantly used in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]].{{Efn|The Metric Conversion Act of 1985 gives the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the United States. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]). In 2008, the NIST published the U.S. version ([http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (BIPM) publication {{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me International d' Unit\u00e9s (SI)}} ([http://www1.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8.pdf BIPM, 2006]).

The Director of the NIST officially recognized this publication, together with [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor and Thompson (2008b)], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).}}\n\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ({{val|0|u=degC}}). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1000&nbsp;litres of water has a mass of about 1000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show that it has a density of {{val|0.999975|0.000001|u=kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05).</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

A [[mnemonic]] for its volume relative to an imperial pint is \"a litre of water's a pint and three quarters\"; this is very close, as a litre is actually 1.75975399&nbsp;pints.\n\nA litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10&nbsp;cm, which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4&nbsp;inches (one-third of a foot). One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27&nbsp;litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592&nbsp;litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27-litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter [[L#Forms_and_variants|\"l\"]]. In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]].</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton). In 1990, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre.<ref name=\"BIPM2006-brochure\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\nPrior to 1979, the symbol <span style=\"font-size:112%\">{{Litre}}</span> came into common use in some countries;{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} for example, it was recommended by [[South African Bureau of Standards]] publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s.

The abbreviation \"cc\" is still commonly used in many fields including medical dosage and sizing for [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] [[engine displacement|displacement]].\n\nThe microlitre (\u03bcL) has been known in the past as the [[Lambda (unit)|lambda]] (\u03bb), but this usage is now discouraged.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carl A. |last1=Burtis |first2=David E. |last2=Bruns |year=2014 |title=Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics |edition=7. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323292061 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7XwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |pages=114}}</ref> In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as '''mcL''' on test results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Units of Measurement - Mayo Medical Laboratories|url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/appendix/measurement.html|website=www.mayomedicallaboratories.com|accessdate=23 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[SI]] system, use of prefixes for powers of 1,000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}<!-- is this true?? --> In countries where \nthe [[metric system]] was established well before the adoption of the [[SI]] standard other multiples were already established, their use remains common. In particular, use of the \"centi\" (10<sup>\u22122</sup>), \"deci\" (10<sup>\u22121</sup>), \"deca\" (10<sup>+1</sup>) and \"hecto\" (10<sup>+2</sup>) prefixes are still common.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of [[beverages]] (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in [[Switzerland]] and [[Scandinavia]] and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Belgium]], a \"vijfentwintiger\" and a \"drie\u00ebndertiger\" (literally \"twenty-fiver\" and \"thirty-threer\") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL or 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for 'artisanal' brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the [[SI]] standard was established, common usage more closely follows contemporary [[SI]] conventions. For example, in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} An exception is in pathology, where for instance [[blood lead level]] may be measured in micrograms per decilitre.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1&nbsp;kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAlthough kilolitres, megalitres, and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, for larger volumes of fluids, such as annual consumption of tap water, lorry (truck) tanks, or swimming pools, the [[cubic metre]] is the general unit. It is also generally for all volumes of a non-liquid nature.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Acre-foot]]\n* [[Claude \u00c9mile Jean-Baptiste Litre]]\n* [[Cubic centimetre]]\n* [[Cubic metre]]\n* [[Gallon]]\n* [[Integrated nanoliter system]]\n* [[Kilogram]]\n* [[Pint]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite web |author=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |title=The International System of Units (SI) |year=2006 |url= http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2008-08-18}}\n* Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.

Yugi revives an ancient spirit called {{nihongo|'''Atem'''|\u95c7\u904a\u622f|Yami Y\u016bgi}}. During the series, Yugi forms friendships with the supporting cast, interacts with Atem and learns about his secrets. Besides the manga, Yugi has also appeared in the anime adaptations, films and [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! video games|video games]] based on the franchise.\n\nYugi was created as a weak, young man who is interested in games and becomes a hero when playing them. According to [[Takahashi]], through this trait, Yugi emphasizes the series' themes; friendship and the enjoyment of games. Atem was created as a hero who would appeal to young children through his strong characterization.\n\nCritical reception to Yugi has been mixed; some writers found Yami Yugi to be too dark for the series but others praised the [[character arc|development]] of both Yugi and his lookalike alter-ego. His role in movies, mostly ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions|The Dark Side of Dimensions]]'', was also praised for featuring a more mature version of the character.\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Kazuki takahashi.jpg|thumb|Kazuki Takahashi]]\n\n[[Kazuki Takahashi]] had always been interested in games; he was obsessed with them as a child and is still interested in them as an adult. He considered the player of a game becomes a hero. He decided to base the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' series around such games and used this idea as the premise. Yugi was a weak, childish boy who became a hero when he played games. Friendship is one of the major themes of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!''; Takahashi based the names of the two major characters \"Y\u016bgi\" and \"J\u014dnouchi\" on the word y\u016bj\u014d (\u53cb\u60c5), which means \"friendship\". Henshin, the ability to turn oneself into something or someone else, is something Takahashi believed all children dream of. He considered Yugi's \"henshin\" Dark Yugi, a savvy, invincible games player, to appeal to children.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Takeuchi Cullen, Lisa|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020702174238/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/multimedia/takahashi_int/frameset.exclude.html|title='I've Always Been Obsessed With Games'|magazine=[[Time Asia]]|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=In a game, the player becomes the hero.

For example, the author believes the regular Yugi and [[Katsuya Jonouchi]] (known as [[Joey Wheeler]] in the English anime) to have more potential as characters because they only focus on enjoying games. He felt Yami Yugi and [[Seto Kaiba]] are weaker characters despite the former's heroic traits. As a result, he believes Dark Yugi is at his best when he is being supported by the rest of the cast.<ref name=\"guidebook\">{{cite book|title=\u904a\u2606\u622f\u2606\u738b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u2015\u771f\u7406\u306e\u798f\u97f3|trans-title=Yu-Gi-Oh!

He believes, however, the most important part of their relationship is before Yugi's duel against Marik's alter-ego. Before the game begins, Kaiba passes Yugi a card that could help him in the game. This scene felt like one of the most difficult scenes to write because of the pair's rivalry.<ref name=\"guidebook\"/>\n\nIn the first anime adaption of the manga, [[Megumi Ogata]] voiced the main character and [[Shunsuke Kazama]] replaced her for the following one. [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] was Yugi's and Yami Yugi's voice actor in U.S. anime episodes.

During the manga's first chapter, he tries to complete the {{nihongo|Millennium Puzzle|\u5343\u5e74\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb|Sennen Pazuru}}, one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact, in hopes it will grant his wish of obtaining friends. However, he is bullied by two classmates, Katsuya Jonouchi (Joey Wheeler in the English anime) and Hiroto Honda (Tristan Taylor), with the former stealing a piece. When the school's hall monitor (named Ushio) beats up the two of them, Yugi comes to the bullies' defence and gets beaten up by Ushio. This causes Jonouchi to return the stolen piece to Yugi's grandfather, who later gives Yugi the piece. Yugi completes the Millennium Puzzle which causes him to be possessed by another person , who, according to the book of the dead, who ever solves the Millennium puzzle inherits the shadow games, becomes the guardian of right and passes judgement on evil. The second personality inhabiting Yugi's body, often referred to in the manga by such epithets as the {{nihongo|Game King|\u904a\u622f\u738b|Y\u016bgi\u014d|extra=King of Games in most English translations}}.<ref name=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!

Across the following chapters he also forms bonds with other characters, most notably his crush, Anzu Mazaki (T\u00e9a Gardner in the English anime), who instead develops a crush for Yugi's alter-ego, and Honda. During the story, Yugi meets a teenager named Seto Kaiba obsessed with a card game known as Duel Monsters. He takes the Blue Eyes White-Dragon, which belongs to Sugoroku Mutou (Solomon Mutou in the English dub) from Yugi, who had taken the card to school that day, and swaps it for a fake, Yugi's grandfather; Sugoroku considers the card his most precious treasure he got from a friend. After Kaiba destroys the card and psychologically tortures the grandfather, Yugi and his friends enter Kaiba's Death-T challenge to end the torture. At the end Yugi and Kaiba have a duel, in which Yugi defeats him. This results into a rivalry as Kaiba seeks to have his rematch against both Yugi and Dark Yugi.\n\nShortly after Kaiba's defeat, Yugi receives an invitation to the Duel Monsters tournaments held by Maximillion J. Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in Japanese versions)<!--The VIZ manga uses \"Maximillion J. Pegasus\"-->. In order to lure him out, Pegasus steals Sugoroku's soul with his Millennium Eye. Yugi and Jonouchi go to the tournament, with the latter seeking to use the prize money to use it for an operation to restore his sister's eyesight. Accompanied by Anzu and Honda, Yugi and Jonouchi defeat multiple duelists but Yugi is forced to let himself to be defeated by Kaiba; the soul of Mokuba Kaiba, Seto Kaiba's brother, had also been stolen. With the help of a former rival, Mai Kujaku (Mai Valentine in the English anime), Yugi manages to reach Pegasus' mansion. Following the tournament, Yugi and Yami are able to defeat Pegasus. While Pegasus restores the stolen souls, Yugi gives Jonouchi the prize money for the medical treatment of his sister, Shizuka Kawai (Serenity Wheeler).\n\nSome time after Pegasus' tournament, Dark Yugi learns from a woman named Ishizu Ishtar that he was once a Pharaoh but his memory was erased during a conflict. Shortly after this, Kaiba announces his own tournament \u2013 Battle City \u2013 where every loser in the competition has to give the winner their most valuable card. A group of hunters led by Ishizu's corrupted younger brother, Malik, are set to challenge Yugi, having a vendetta against the Pharaoh. In one duel, Yugi is faced by Osiris, the Sky Dragon<!--The Viz Manga uses English names of the cards-->: one of the three Egyptian God Cards which are recognized as the three strongest cards. Yugi defeats Marik's hunter and earns Osiris. He later uses it to defeat Yami Bakura and once again to confront Kaiba in a rematch, as his rival uses the second God Card: Obelisk the Tormentor. Yugi defeats Kaiba and obtains Obelisk. In the finale, Yugi faces Marik's own darker alter-ego who has the third God Card: The Winged Dragon of Ra. Using a card Kaiba previously passed him, Yugi defeats Marik, obtains Ra and becomes the tournament's champion.\n \n[[File:Atemtrueform.png|thumb|right|Yami Yugi's original Pharaoh appearance while commanding the God Osiris]]\nDuring the final story arc of the manga, Dark Yugi uses the three God Cards to learn of his past. He is transported to an alternate version of his life where he lived as a Pharaoh. During this time, the Pharaoh clashes against Yami Bakura multiple times while Yugi and his friends search for a way to aid him. At the end of the manga, it is revealed that his name as Pharaoh was {{nihongo|Atem|\u30a2\u30c6\u30e0|Atemu}}, who sealed his soul into the Puzzle along with the Great God of Evil, Zorc Necrophades. The group is finally able to defeat Zorc and his avatar, Dark Bakura, once and for all in the memory world (which reenacted the Pharaoh's past) and help Atem pass over into the afterlife.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Dangreen05.jpg|thumb|[[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] has voiced Yugi in all of his U.S. English appearances]]\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\nIn ''Yu-Gi-Oh R'', which takes place following Yugi's victory in the Battle City tournament. Yako Tenma, student and adopted son of [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Maximillion Pegasus|Maximillion Pegasus]], decides to avenge his teacher's defeat at the hands of Yugi, believing him to be responsible for Pegasus' alleged death. Tenma kidnaps T\u00e9a Gardner, prompting Yugi and his friend Joey Wheeler to face Tenma's RA Project and the duel professors.\n\nHe is also present ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters'' where Yugi goes with his friends to find the missing Solomon Moto. In their journey, Yugi realizes that somehow they have been transported into the world of Capsule Monsters.\n\nThe film ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'' follows a new duel between Yugi and Kaiba. However, the latter has been used by an ancient being known as Anubis who aims to kill the Pharaoh.\n\nYugi's next appearance is in the movie ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time]]'' where he joins the duelists Jaden Yuki and Yusei Fudo to defeat the mysterious Paradox.\n\nIn ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions]]'' Yugi and his closest friends are in their final year of High School and are talking about what they will do in the future. They are antagonized by Kaiba who wishes to face the Pharaoh who has left to the afterlife. Nevertheless, in the final duel the Pharaoh makes a brief appearance to assist Yugi in defeating the corrupted Aigami.\n\nThe video game ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories'' follows the Pharaoh's daily life in Egypt until he is sealed into the Millennium Puzzle. Yugi inherits the puzzle and gathers each Millennium item which allows the Pharaoh to deal with his enemies until he keeps peace in his world.\n\nIn ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

He felt Yami Yugi and [[Seto Kaiba]] are weaker characters despite the former's heroic traits. As a result, he believes Dark Yugi is at his best when he is being supported by the rest of the cast.<ref name=\"guidebook\">{{cite book|title=\u904a\u2606\u622f\u2606\u738b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u2015\u771f\u7406\u306e\u798f\u97f3|trans-title=Yu-Gi-Oh!

He believes, however, the most important part of their relationship is before Yugi's duel against Marik's alter-ego. Before the game begins, Kaiba passes Yugi a card that could help him in the game. This scene felt like one of the most difficult scenes to write because of the pair's rivalry.<ref name=\"guidebook\"/>\n\nIn the first anime adaption of the manga, [[Megumi Ogata]] voiced the main character and [[Shunsuke Kazama]] replaced her for the following one. [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] was Yugi's and Yami Yugi's voice actor in U.S. anime episodes.

During the manga's first chapter, he tries to complete the {{nihongo|Millennium Puzzle|\u5343\u5e74\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb|Sennen Pazuru}}, one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact, in hopes it will grant his wish of obtaining friends. However, he is bullied by two classmates, Katsuya Jonouchi (Joey Wheeler in the English anime) and Hiroto Honda (Tristan Taylor), with the former stealing a piece. When the school's hall monitor (named Ushio) beats up the two of them, Yugi comes to the bullies' defence and gets beaten up by Ushio. This causes Jonouchi to return the stolen piece to Yugi's grandfather, who later gives Yugi the piece. Yugi completes the Millennium Puzzle which causes him to be possessed by another person , who, according to the book of the dead, who ever solves the Millennium puzzle inherits the shadow games, becomes the guardian of right and passes judgement on evil. The second personality inhabiting Yugi's body, often referred to in the manga by such epithets as the {{nihongo|Game King|\u904a\u622f\u738b|Y\u016bgi\u014d|extra=King of Games in most English translations}}.<ref name=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!

Across the following chapters he also forms bonds with other characters, most notably his crush, Anzu Mazaki (T\u00e9a Gardner in the English anime), who instead develops a crush for Yugi's alter-ego, and Honda. During the story, Yugi meets a teenager named Seto Kaiba obsessed with a card game known as Duel Monsters. He takes the Blue Eyes White-Dragon, which belongs to Sugoroku Mutou (Solomon Mutou in the English dub) from Yugi, who had taken the card to school that day, and swaps it for a fake, Yugi's grandfather; Sugoroku considers the card his most precious treasure he got from a friend. After Kaiba destroys the card and psychologically tortures the grandfather, Yugi and his friends enter Kaiba's Death-T challenge to end the torture. At the end Yugi and Kaiba have a duel, in which Yugi defeats him. This results into a rivalry as Kaiba seeks to have his rematch against both Yugi and Dark Yugi.\n\nShortly after Kaiba's defeat, Yugi receives an invitation to the Duel Monsters tournaments held by Maximillion J. Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in Japanese versions)<!--The VIZ manga uses \"Maximillion J. Pegasus\"-->. In order to lure him out, Pegasus steals Sugoroku's soul with his Millennium Eye. Yugi and Jonouchi go to the tournament, with the latter seeking to use the prize money to use it for an operation to restore his sister's eyesight. Accompanied by Anzu and Honda, Yugi and Jonouchi defeat multiple duelists but Yugi is forced to let himself to be defeated by Kaiba; the soul of Mokuba Kaiba, Seto Kaiba's brother, had also been stolen. With the help of a former rival, Mai Kujaku (Mai Valentine in the English anime), Yugi manages to reach Pegasus' mansion. Following the tournament, Yugi and Yami are able to defeat Pegasus. While Pegasus restores the stolen souls, Yugi gives Jonouchi the prize money for the medical treatment of his sister, Shizuka Kawai (Serenity Wheeler).\n\nSome time after Pegasus' tournament, Dark Yugi learns from a woman named Ishizu Ishtar that he was once a Pharaoh but his memory was erased during a conflict. Shortly after this, Kaiba announces his own tournament \u2013 Battle City \u2013 where every loser in the competition has to give the winner their most valuable card. A group of hunters led by Ishizu's corrupted younger brother, Malik, are set to challenge Yugi, having a vendetta against the Pharaoh. In one duel, Yugi is faced by Osiris, the Sky Dragon<!--The Viz Manga uses English names of the cards-->: one of the three Egyptian God Cards which are recognized as the three strongest cards. Yugi defeats Marik's hunter and earns Osiris. He later uses it to defeat Yami Bakura and once again to confront Kaiba in a rematch, as his rival uses the second God Card: Obelisk the Tormentor. Yugi defeats Kaiba and obtains Obelisk. In the finale, Yugi faces Marik's own darker alter-ego who has the third God Card: The Winged Dragon of Ra. Using a card Kaiba previously passed him, Yugi defeats Marik, obtains Ra and becomes the tournament's champion.\n \n[[File:Atemtrueform.png|thumb|right|Yami Yugi's original Pharaoh appearance while commanding the God Osiris]]\nDuring the final story arc of the manga, Dark Yugi uses the three God Cards to learn of his past. He is transported to an alternate version of his life where he lived as a Pharaoh. During this time, the Pharaoh clashes against Yami Bakura multiple times while Yugi and his friends search for a way to aid him. At the end of the manga, it is revealed that his name as Pharaoh was {{nihongo|Atem|\u30a2\u30c6\u30e0|Atemu}}, who sealed his soul into the Puzzle along with the Great God of Evil, Zorc Necrophades. The group is finally able to defeat Zorc and his avatar, Dark Bakura, once and for all in the memory world (which reenacted the Pharaoh's past) and help Atem pass over into the afterlife.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Dangreen05.jpg|thumb|[[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] has voiced Yugi in all of his U.S. English appearances]]\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\nIn ''Yu-Gi-Oh R'', which takes place following Yugi's victory in the Battle City tournament.

In their journey, Yugi realizes that somehow they have been transported into the world of Capsule Monsters.\n\nThe film ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

Before he could begin to comprehend what on earth was going on, the beautiful Goddess [[Belldandy]] warped into Keiichi's dorm to grant him a wish. Convinced his older classmates are playing a prank on him as he has no luck with girls, Keiichi wishes for a girl like Belldandy to be by his side forever. Much to his surprise his wish is granted. Ever since, the two have been together. Belldandy's presence attracted a lot of attention not just in the mortal realm. Even though he may seem indecisive and very shy, when it comes to love he is very reliable.\n\nHe is a very skilled mechanic and an exceptional race driver. His abilities are somewhat glossed over in the [[Oh My Goddess! (OVA)|OVA]] series, but are displayed to great effect in the movie. In the manga, he is bestowed the directorship of the Motor Club, which he subsequently passes on to [[Sora Hasegawa]]. At his supposed graduating from college (ch 78, he was one class shy), he started working at the repair shop ''Whirlwind'' owned by the founder of the NIT Motor Club: [[Chihiro Fujimi]].  He picked up the one class and actually graduated many chapters later.\n\nKeiichi has a sister, [[Megumi Morisato]]. As revealed in vol. 23 of the manga, he and his family are originally from the [[Kushiro, Hokkaid\u014d|Kushiro]] subprefecture in northeastern [[Hokkaid\u014d]] (the northern island of Japan). His father [[Keima Morisato|Keima]] is a glassblower with a natural gift for motorcycle maintenance (as well as a fear of being touched by women).  His mother [[Takano Morisato|Takano]] is an avid [[mahjong|mah-jong]] player.\n\n== Personality ==\nSimply put, Keiichi is a nice guy. He tries to be nice to everyone, and doesn't like to see anyone hurt, or hurt anyone himself. He even tries to reason with [[Welsper]], even while the latter is trying to kill him.\n\nHowever, Keiichi isn't stupid because he thinks about doing (though sometimes he can be quite gullible), and can (and will) speak out if the situation calls for it. He is also rather intelligent; for example, once he answered a test full of complex chemical and mechanical questions in two minutes flat while the other students were struggling with more conventional problems.\n\nKeiichi's pure and innocent personality also puts him in the middle of an unusual love relationship. While he understands he loves Belldandy (and she loves him as well), he sometimes has a difficult time expressing his feelings. However, there is no mistaking the bond between them, as he and Belldandy had passed the ultimate test of true love in the ''[[Ah! My Goddess: The Movie]]''. Finally, he also seems to exhibit unadulterated purity in his actions; he helps out others in need, he rarely complains about setbacks, and always attempts to be truthful about any situation. However, Keiichi's 'pure' personality has recently been explained in chapter 285 of the manga. According to Hild, when Keiichi made his first contract with Belldandy, heaven placed a powerful seal on him that completely suppressed all his desires and longings for Belldandy. Faced with a situation where a goddess was now bound to a mortal, heaven placed this seal in order to maintain the 'separation' between gods and men. Urd and Belldandy (and presumably Peorth and Lind, given their rank and knowledge of the Yggdrasil system) were both aware of the seal and its direct subversion of a Class 1 Unlimited Goddess's inability to lie, and were concerned of possible repercussions should Keiichi become aware of it.\n\nKeiichi's sense of fun influences his life in many ways. He relishes creating unusual motor vehicles when presented with a challenge, usually by one of his seniors \u2013 Tamiya, Otaki or Chihiro \u2013 and laughs like crazy during a heated motorbike race against his father.\n\nIn the manga, he can play acoustic guitar, and is a fan of singer [[Matthew Sweet]], possibly due to his quirky upbringing (in the original Japanese, it's [[The Carpenters]]). This is shown in the ''Traveler'' arc in 18, when he befriends a Schr\u00f6dinger's Whale (a being that lives in a 5-dimensional quantum state) that is attracted to a storage room artificially expanded by Skuld to infinite capacity; he teaches the friendly whale some of his songs when he (for Belldandy notes it is male) shows curiosity in CD he's playing. When riding the whale through 3D space, it starts singing ''Millennium Blues'', then whips into 5D spacetime with Keiichi still riding it; whereas this would make some freak out, he has a great time, and they chill in the middle of the room's infinite space singing ''I\u2019ve Been Waiting''. Overnight, the whale learns Sweet's ''Missing Time'' by itself before it disappears (in the original Japanese, the song is ''Only Yesterday''), and when Keiichi realises this, he learns that by giving the endangered whales a call enabling them to locate each other (5D spacetime being even more than infinite than 3D, Schr\u00f6dinger's Whales rarely meet by pure dumb luck), he's inadvertently saved the species.\n\nIn the manga, Keiichi's personality was illustrated when he was able to summon one of the Valkyrie [[Lind (Oh My Goddess!)|Lind]]'s own Angels, Cool Mint. According to Lind, he was able to host the angel with the \"love of goddesses\" which he received due to his innocent personality.

His name is often abbreviated as \"K1\" (1 in the [[Japanese language]] is \"ichi\").\n\n== Description ==\nKeiichi was a 21-year-old student of the [[Nekomi Institute of Technology]] and a member of the NIT Motor Club. Keiichi is portrayed as a typical college student with a notable lack of experience with women.<ref name=\"Newitz\">{{cite journal | last = Newitz | first = Annalee | authorlink=Annalee Newitz | year = 1995  | title = Magical Girls and Atomic Bomb Sperm: Japanese Animation in America | journal = [[Film Quarterly]] | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 2\u201315  | doi = 10.1525/fq.1995.49.1.04a00020 }}</ref> One day Keiichi accidentally dialed the [[Goddess Relief Office]]. Before he could begin to comprehend what on earth was going on, the beautiful Goddess [[Belldandy]] warped into Keiichi's dorm to grant him a wish. Convinced his older classmates are playing a prank on him as he has no luck with girls, Keiichi wishes for a girl like Belldandy to be by his side forever. Much to his surprise his wish is granted. Ever since, the two have been together. Belldandy's presence attracted a lot of attention not just in the mortal realm. Even though he may seem indecisive and very shy, when it comes to love he is very reliable.\n\nHe is a very skilled mechanic and an exceptional race driver. His abilities are somewhat glossed over in the [[Oh My Goddess! (OVA)|OVA]] series, but are displayed to great effect in the movie. In the manga, he is bestowed the directorship of the Motor Club, which he subsequently passes on to [[Sora Hasegawa]]. At his supposed graduating from college (ch 78, he was one class shy), he started working at the repair shop ''Whirlwind'' owned by the founder of the NIT Motor Club: [[Chihiro Fujimi]].  He picked up the one class and actually graduated many chapters later.\n\nKeiichi has a sister, [[Megumi Morisato]]. As revealed in vol. 23 of the manga, he and his family are originally from the [[Kushiro, Hokkaid\u014d|Kushiro]] subprefecture in northeastern [[Hokkaid\u014d]] (the northern island of Japan). His father [[Keima Morisato|Keima]] is a glassblower with a natural gift for motorcycle maintenance (as well as a fear of being touched by women).  His mother [[Takano Morisato|Takano]] is an avid [[mahjong|mah-jong]] player.\n\n== Personality ==\nSimply put, Keiichi is a nice guy. He tries to be nice to everyone, and doesn't like to see anyone hurt, or hurt anyone himself. He even tries to reason with [[Welsper]], even while the latter is trying to kill him.\n\nHowever, Keiichi isn't stupid because he thinks about doing (though sometimes he can be quite gullible), and can (and will) speak out if the situation calls for it. He is also rather intelligent; for example, once he answered a test full of complex chemical and mechanical questions in two minutes flat while the other students were struggling with more conventional problems.\n\nKeiichi's pure and innocent personality also puts him in the middle of an unusual love relationship. While he understands he loves Belldandy (and she loves him as well), he sometimes has a difficult time expressing his feelings. However, there is no mistaking the bond between them, as he and Belldandy had passed the ultimate test of true love in the ''[[Ah! My Goddess: The Movie]]''. Finally, he also seems to exhibit unadulterated purity in his actions; he helps out others in need, he rarely complains about setbacks, and always attempts to be truthful about any situation. However, Keiichi's 'pure' personality has recently been explained in chapter 285 of the manga. According to Hild, when Keiichi made his first contract with Belldandy, heaven placed a powerful seal on him that completely suppressed all his desires and longings for Belldandy. Faced with a situation where a goddess was now bound to a mortal, heaven placed this seal in order to maintain the 'separation' between gods and men. Urd and Belldandy (and presumably Peorth and Lind, given their rank and knowledge of the Yggdrasil system) were both aware of the seal and its direct subversion of a Class 1 Unlimited Goddess's inability to lie, and were concerned of possible repercussions should Keiichi become aware of it.\n\nKeiichi's sense of fun influences his life in many ways. He relishes creating unusual motor vehicles when presented with a challenge, usually by one of his seniors \u2013 Tamiya, Otaki or Chihiro \u2013 and laughs like crazy during a heated motorbike race against his father.\n\nIn the manga, he can play acoustic guitar, and is a fan of singer [[Matthew Sweet]], possibly due to his quirky upbringing (in the original Japanese, it's [[The Carpenters]]). This is shown in the ''Traveler'' arc in 18, when he befriends a Schr\u00f6dinger's Whale (a being that lives in a 5-dimensional quantum state) that is attracted to a storage room artificially expanded by Skuld to infinite capacity; he teaches the friendly whale some of his songs when he (for Belldandy notes it is male) shows curiosity in CD he's playing. When riding the whale through 3D space, it starts singing ''Millennium Blues'', then whips into 5D spacetime with Keiichi still riding it; whereas this would make some freak out, he has a great time, and they chill in the middle of the room's infinite space singing ''I\u2019ve Been Waiting''. Overnight, the whale learns Sweet's ''Missing Time'' by itself before it disappears (in the original Japanese, the song is ''Only Yesterday''), and when Keiichi realises this, he learns that by giving the endangered whales a call enabling them to locate each other (5D spacetime being even more than infinite than 3D, Schr\u00f6dinger's Whales rarely meet by pure dumb luck), he's inadvertently saved the species.\n\nIn the manga, Keiichi's personality was illustrated when he was able to summon one of the Valkyrie [[Lind (Oh My Goddess!)|Lind]]'s own Angels, Cool Mint. According to Lind, he was able to host the angel with the \"love of goddesses\" which he received due to his innocent personality. Because of the love from the three goddesses for Keiichi, he was more than capable to handle controlling the angel.\n\nLater on, Keiichi also temporarily and involuntarily hosted the familiar/angel hybrid Blue Lance (then unnamed). She chose Keiichi as her host because he was the only person who referred to her as an \"angel\" and not as a \u201cformer devil\". Belldandy complimented him that it was natural for him to not even notice it.\n\nThe English child voices of Keiichi and Belldandy in the last OVA episode were created by the actors using helium.<ref>OVA episode 5 DVD commentary</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Oh My Goddess}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morisato, Keiichi}}\n[[Category:Oh My Goddess! characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional mechanics]]\n", "name_user": "47.31.170.229", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiichi_Morisato"}

She was born into a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral Takashi Hayase.<ref name=\"AnimEigo_Char\"/> Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, Riber Fruhling, in the [[UN Spacy]]. However, this dream ended when Riber died during the destruction of the returning U.N. Spacy fleet from the ''Salla'' [[Mars]] Base (where he was stationed) by hostile Anti-U.N. terrorist forces (with a stolen U.N. Spacy space cruiser).<ref>[http://macross.anime.net/wiki/2005 Official Information of Riber's Death and the loss of all the Mars Base Salla Personnel]</ref><ref name=\"Riber\">{{cite web|title=Translation & Cultural Notes |url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 |work=The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes |publisher=[[AnimEigo]] |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2009-04-26 |quote=The story of Misa and Riber's romance and the tragedy of the Mars Base crew is retold in the novel ''Misa Hayase: White Reminiscences'' written by Oonogi Hiroshi. The crew died after they evacuated the base and were attacked by Anti-United Nations forces en route back to Earth. The flashback between Misa and Riber takes place in the beginning of 2004, about two years after the couple first met. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212437/http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t |archivedate=2008-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers' Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the [[SDF-1 Macross]]. Her rank was First Lieutenant at the beginning of the series. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer [[Claudia LaSalle]] became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. However, this mindset changed after she met the young pilot [[Hikaru Ichijyo]], who at that time was in love with the soon-to-be superstar [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]]. The relationship between Misa and Hikaru slowly evolved throughout the series. In the beginning, Misa and Hikaru had a difficult superior-subordinate relationship, starting with Hikaru calling her \"old woman\" (''obasan'') when he saw her for the first time on his Valkyrie's screen, which, much to Misa's chagrin, resultsed in his [[senpai]] [[Roy Focker]] having a good laugh. However, the intensity of their relationship gradually softened after going through a series of crises and intimate moments together: Hikaru rescued Misa from the Mars base before the base exploded ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 7: Bye Bye Mars]]); they had their first \"mission kiss\" while demonstrating \"Protoculture\" to the Zentradi people ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 11: First Contact]]) and later managed to escape together ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 12: Big Escape]]); they accidentally shared an evening together while trapped in the transformed Macross and revealed to each other their respective lovelorn stories (Episode 21: Micro Cosmo).\n\nWhile they were still unsure of their own feelings, both felt deep loneliness after Misa departed Macross to Earth, trying to persuade the United Government to enter peace negotiations with the Zentradi troops. Clumsy at communicating his feelings, Hikaru sent Misa the message \"Wish you return to Macross safely\" using the [[Morse code]] ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 24: Goodbye, Girl]]).\n\nAt the end of the Space War I, Hikaru ventured into the ruined Alaska base on Earth and rescued the sole survivor Misa. After their reunion, Hikaru told Misa that even though they were probably the only survivors on earth, he was happy as long as the partner was Misa ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 27: Love Flows By]]).\n\nAfter Space War I, the love triangle of Misa-Hikaru-Minmay underwent many turns and Misa was deeply hurt by Hikaru's lingering feeling for Lynn Minmay. However, Hikaru eventually realized that he could not live without Misa after the heartbroken Misa confessed her love for him while bidding farewell to him.\n\nThe two got married on October 10, 2011 and their first daughter Ichijo Miku \u4e00\u6761\u672a\u6765 was born a year later.<ref name=\"FlashBack\">Best Hit Series: ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012 Graffiti''. Y910. Shougakukan. Japan, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Misa and Hikaru were appointed as the Commander of the new ''[[SDF-2 Megaroad-01]]'' ship and the Capitan of the ship's escorting Valkyrie group, inaugurating the space colonization chapter in the Macross history.\n\nIn 2016, Megaroad-01 lost contact with Earth and Misa, Hikaru, Miku and the ship's crew and citizens (including Lynn Minmay, who remained as their friend and also boarded the ship) were declared missing.\n\nIn the world of [[Macross Delta]], signals were received from the long lost Megaroad-01. A mysterious \"Lady M\"&nbsp;(\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3M&nbsp;''Redi Emu'') from Megaroad-01, whose identity was never revealed in the TV series, loomed large behind the scenes. What is known that this mysterious figure had been sponsoring researches on songs/Protoculture since Space War I, and eventually created the ultimate songtress&nbsp;Mikumo Guynemer. Given the grand vision, political influence, and competence of Lady M in dealing with the New United Government and initiating the researches, the most likely candidate is&nbsp;Misa, the Commander of Megaroad-01 and the one who deciphered the lyrics of the song \"[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Do You Remember Love]].\" The true identity of Lady M will be revealed in&nbsp;''Macross Delta The Movie: Passionate Walk\u016bre''&nbsp;(release date February 9, 2018).\n\n==Additional notes on the character==\n[[Image:FB2012 Misa.jpg|left|thumb|Misa Hayase as she appears in ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012'']]\n\nMisa's character is the total opposite of the sweet, flighty, insecure Minmay. She's a strong-willed, determined and down-to-earth type of woman, completely immersed in doing her duty; at the same time, these traits had made her unable to maintain romantic relationships, although, as seen in the series, she lets her feelings interfere with her work.\n\nMisa's best friend is officer [[Claudia LaSalle]], who knows Misa from their days at the military academy. She is her confidante and advisor in her personal life.<ref>Character of Macross: Claudia LaSalle. Pages 120 and 121. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10.</ref>\n\nAccording to an article in ''[[Animerica]]'' magazine, Shoji Kawamori's original idea for the ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross|Macross]]'' series was an all-female crew for the battleship with a female captain at the helm. After the idea was revamped for its final presentation, the female captain idea was reworked and became the template for Misa's character.<ref>The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: The Making of Macross. Pages 203-246. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10.</ref>\n\nWhile the ''Macross''-related film ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' tells a different take of events from the original series, Misa's character and relationship with Hikaru is portrayed in similar fashion as in the original.\n\nIn the American re-working of the series that became known as ''[[Robotech]]'' her name was changed to Lisa Hayes and her ethnicity was changed to a [[Caucasian American]].\n\n==Legacy==\nCatherine Glass of ''[[Macross Frontier]]'' physically resembles Misa Hayase, and is also shown to have trouble keeping up with a decent love life. Unlike Misa, Catherine and her love interest are supporting characters, rather than leading characters.\n\nSheryl Nome from ''[[Macross Frontier]]''  also resembles Misa Hayase. Both of them are strong willed and down to earth women. In the manga adaptation of the series, there is a small tribute that has her wearing Misa's clothes (to match Ranka who wears Minmay's and Alto who is dressing as Hikaru).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.macross.co.jp/ Official Macross website]{{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://macross.anime.net/characters/i/index.html#ichijyo_misa Misa Hayase] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081103050755/http://macross.anime.net/wiki/1997 Events in the year 1997 in the Macross chronology] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081227003018/http://macross.anime.net/wiki/2010 Events in the year 2010 in the Macross chronology] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060425145600/http://www.macrossnexus.com/ Macross Nexus]\n\n{{Macross series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayase, Misa}}\n[[Category:Female characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional female majors]]\n[[Category:Fictional military brats]]\n[[Category:Macross characters|Hayase, Misa]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the character from [[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]|the derived character in ''[[Robotech]]''|Lisa Hayes}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=March 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name         = Misa Hayase\n| series       = Macross\n| image        = [[File:Scene from Robotech.jpg|230px]]\n| caption      =\n| first        = Episode 1 - \"Boobytrap\"<ref name=\"AnimEigo_Char\">{{cite web|title=Character Notes |url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#2 |work=The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes |publisher=[[AnimEigo]] |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2009-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212437/http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t |archivedate=2008-12-30 }}</ref>\n| creator      =\n| voiced by    = [[Mika Doi]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/><ref name=\"AnimEigo_Voice\"/><ref name=\"Official\"/><ref name=\"Dub\"/>\n| nationality  = Japanese-American\n| relatives    = [[Hikaru Ichijyo]] ''(Husband)''<br />Takashi Hayase ''(Father)''<br />Sakiko Hayase ''(Mother)''<br />Miku Ichijyo ''(Daughter)''\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Misa Hayase'''|\u65e9\u702c \u672a\u6c99|''Hayase Misa''}} is one of the central [[fictional character]]s of the ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross|Macross]]'' Japanese anime series.<ref name=\"Character\">Character of Macross: Misa Hayase.

She was born into a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] family with a hundred-year military lineage and was the only daughter of Admiral Takashi Hayase.<ref name=\"AnimEigo_Char\"/> Misa also had aspired to enter the military since childhood. This dream was bolstered by a desire to join her boyfriend and first love, Riber Fruhling, in the [[UN Spacy]]. However, this dream ended when Riber died during the destruction of the returning U.N. Spacy fleet from the ''Salla'' [[Mars]] Base (where he was stationed) by hostile Anti-U.N. terrorist forces (with a stolen U.N. Spacy space cruiser).<ref>[http://macross.anime.net/wiki/2005 Official Information of Riber's Death and the loss of all the Mars Base Salla Personnel]</ref><ref name=\"Riber\">{{cite web|title=Translation & Cultural Notes |url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 |work=The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes |publisher=[[AnimEigo]] |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2009-04-26 |quote=The story of Misa and Riber's romance and the tragedy of the Mars Base crew is retold in the novel ''Misa Hayase: White Reminiscences'' written by Oonogi Hiroshi.

The flashback between Misa and Riber takes place in the beginning of 2004, about two years after the couple first met. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212437/http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t |archivedate=2008-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating first in her class at the UN Spacy Officers' Academy, she earned a bridge post aboard the [[SDF-1 Macross]]. Her rank was First Lieutenant at the beginning of the series. She and fellow SDF-1 bridge officer [[Claudia LaSalle]] became close friends. As Misa herself admits, her mind is constantly preoccupied with duty. However, this mindset changed after she met the young pilot [[Hikaru Ichijyo]], who at that time was in love with the soon-to-be superstar [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]]. The relationship between Misa and Hikaru slowly evolved throughout the series. In the beginning, Misa and Hikaru had a difficult superior-subordinate relationship, starting with Hikaru calling her \"old woman\" (''obasan'') when he saw her for the first time on his Valkyrie's screen, which, much to Misa's chagrin, resultsed in his [[senpai]] [[Roy Focker]] having a good laugh. However, the intensity of their relationship gradually softened after going through a series of crises and intimate moments together: Hikaru rescued Misa from the Mars base before the base exploded ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 7: Bye Bye Mars]]); they had their first \"mission kiss\" while demonstrating \"Protoculture\" to the Zentradi people ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 11: First Contact]]) and later managed to escape together ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 12: Big Escape]]); they accidentally shared an evening together while trapped in the transformed Macross and revealed to each other their respective lovelorn stories (Episode 21: Micro Cosmo).\n\nWhile they were still unsure of their own feelings, both felt deep loneliness after Misa departed Macross to Earth, trying to persuade the United Government to enter peace negotiations with the Zentradi troops. Clumsy at communicating his feelings, Hikaru sent Misa the message \"Wish you return to Macross safely\" using the [[Morse code]] ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 24: Goodbye, Girl]]).\n\nAt the end of the Space War I, Hikaru ventured into the ruined Alaska base on Earth and rescued the sole survivor Misa. After their reunion, Hikaru told Misa that even though they were probably the only survivors on earth, he was happy as long as the partner was Misa ([[List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes|Episode 27: Love Flows By]]).\n\nAfter Space War I, the love triangle of Misa-Hikaru-Minmay underwent many turns and Misa was deeply hurt by Hikaru's lingering feeling for Lynn Minmay. However, Hikaru eventually realized that he could not live without Misa after the heartbroken Misa confessed her love for him while bidding farewell to him.\n\nThe two got married on October 10, 2011 and their first daughter Ichijo Miku \u4e00\u6761\u672a\u6765 was born a year later.<ref name=\"FlashBack\">Best Hit Series: ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012 Graffiti''.

Japan, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Misa and Hikaru were appointed as the Commander of the new ''[[SDF-2 Megaroad-01]]'' ship and the Capitan of the ship's escorting Valkyrie group, inaugurating the space colonization chapter in the Macross history.\n\nIn 2016, Megaroad-01 lost contact with Earth and Misa, Hikaru, Miku and the ship's crew and citizens (including Lynn Minmay, who remained as their friend and also boarded the ship) were declared missing.\n\nIn the world of [[Macross Delta]], signals were received from the long lost Megaroad-01. A mysterious \"Lady M\"&nbsp;(\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3M&nbsp;''Redi Emu'') from Megaroad-01, whose identity was never revealed in the TV series, loomed large behind the scenes. What is known that this mysterious figure had been sponsoring researches on songs/Protoculture since Space War I, and eventually created the ultimate songtress&nbsp;Mikumo Guynemer. Given the grand vision, political influence, and competence of Lady M in dealing with the New United Government and initiating the researches, the most likely candidate is&nbsp;Misa, the Commander of Megaroad-01 and the one who deciphered the lyrics of the song \"[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Do You Remember Love]].\" The true identity of Lady M will be revealed in&nbsp;''Macross Delta The Movie: Passionate Walk\u016bre''&nbsp;(release date February 9, 2018).\n\n==Additional notes on the character==\n[[Image:FB2012 Misa.jpg|left|thumb|Misa Hayase as she appears in ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012'']]\n\nMisa's character is the total opposite of the sweet, flighty, insecure Minmay. She's a strong-willed, determined and down-to-earth type of woman, completely immersed in doing her duty; at the same time, these traits had made her unable to maintain romantic relationships, although, as seen in the series, she lets her feelings interfere with her work.\n\nMisa's best friend is officer [[Claudia LaSalle]], who knows Misa from their days at the military academy. She is her confidante and advisor in her personal life.<ref>Character of Macross: Claudia LaSalle. Pages 120 and 121. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10.</ref>\n\nAccording to an article in ''[[Animerica]]'' magazine, Shoji Kawamori's original idea for the ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross|Macross]]'' series was an all-female crew for the battleship with a female captain at the helm. After the idea was revamped for its final presentation, the female captain idea was reworked and became the template for Misa's character.<ref>The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: The Making of Macross. Pages 203-246. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Y2800. Minori Library, Japan. 1983, October 10.</ref>\n\nWhile the ''Macross''-related film ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' tells a different take of events from the original series, Misa's character and relationship with Hikaru is portrayed in similar fashion as in the original.\n\nIn the American re-working of the series that became known as ''[[Robotech]]'' her name was changed to Lisa Hayes and her ethnicity was changed to a [[Caucasian American]].\n\n==Legacy==\nCatherine Glass of ''[[Macross Frontier]]'' physically resembles Misa Hayase, and is also shown to have trouble keeping up with a decent love life. Unlike Misa, Catherine and her love interest are supporting characters, rather than leading characters.\n\nSheryl Nome from ''[[Macross Frontier]]''  also resembles Misa Hayase. Both of them are strong willed and down to earth women. In the manga adaptation of the series, there is a small tribute that has her wearing Misa's clothes (to match Ranka who wears Minmay's and Alto who is dressing as Hikaru).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.macross.co.jp/ Official Macross website]{{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://macross.anime.net/characters/i/index.html#ichijyo_misa Misa Hayase] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081103050755/http://macross.anime.net/wiki/1997 Events in the year 1997 in the Macross chronology] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081227003018/http://macross.anime.net/wiki/2010 Events in the year 2010 in the Macross chronology] at the *[http://macross.anime.net/ Macross Compendium]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060425145600/http://www.macrossnexus.com/ Macross Nexus]\n\n{{Macross series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayase, Misa}}\n[[Category:Female characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional female majors]]\n[[Category:Fictional military brats]]\n[[Category:Macross characters|Hayase, Misa]]\n", "name_user": "47.31.170.229", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misa_Hayase"}

Later, Chapin visited the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] and saw two stuffed specimens with similar feathers labeled as the 'Indian peacock' which he later discovered to be the Congo peacock, a completely different species.

The male has a similar display to that of other species of peafowl, though the Congo peacock actually fans its tail feathers while other peacocks fan their upper tail [[covert feather]]s. The Congo peafowl is monogamous, though detailed mating information from the wild is still needed. The peacock of the species has a high-pitched \"''gowe''\" calling noise while the peahen emits a low \"''gowah''\".

It occurs in both primary and secondary forest in [[Salonga National Park]]. Secondary signs of its presence like droppings and feathers were more frequently encountered in regenerating secondary forest than in primary forest. In secondary forest, its droppings were found close to watercourses, where trees were smaller and plant diversity lower than in primary forest.<ref name=\"Mulotwa\">{{cite journal |last1=Mulotwa |first1=M. |last2=Louette |first2=M. |last3=Dudu |first3=A. |last4=Upoki |first4=A. |last5=Fuller |first5=R.

Dr. Chapin noticed that the native Congolese headdresses contained long reddish-brown feathers that he couldn't identify with any previously known species of bird. Later, Chapin visited the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] and saw two stuffed specimens with similar feathers labeled as the 'Indian peacock' which he later discovered to be the Congo peacock, a completely different species. In 1955 Chapin managed to find seven specimens of the species .
