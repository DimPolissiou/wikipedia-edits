Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/|title=Foucault, Michel: Political Thought {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe work [[The Blank Slate]] of Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \"money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\" which \"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\" However, they are not a support of the Social Constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}</ref> In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the [[Tabula rasa]] theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions.\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:<ref name=\"Alsop_Theorizing\">{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}</ref>\n# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;\n# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.\n\n===Gender===\n{{main|Gender}}\nHistorically gender was used as means describing the distinction between the biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity.<ref name=\"Marecek, Crawford & Popp\">{{cite book | last1 = Marecek | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Crawford | first2 = Mary | last3 = Popp | first3 = Danielle | chapter = On the construction of gender, sex, and sexualities | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-009 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 192&ndash;216 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref> According to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\"<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]\n:* {{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Doing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA3 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 3&ndash;25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>{{rp|126}}\n\nAs a social construct, gender is considered an achieved status by feminist theory, typically (though not exclusively) one which is achieved very early in childhood. The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

Levant]] and Kathleen Alto write: {{quote |A recent synthesis of meta-analytic studies of gender differences provides strong evidence for a social construct understanding of gender. Ethan Zell and colleagues examined more than 20,000 findings from 12 million participants comparing men and women on topics ranging from risk-taking to body image.

This is not to imply that participation in gender performativity can not correspond to pressure to fulfill a gender role, nor that fulfillment of a gender role can not satisfy the desire for gender performativity. The distinction refers primarily to context and motivation, rather than particular behaviors and consequences- which are often closely linked.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=December 1988|title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?origin=crossref|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=519|doi=10.2307/3207893}}</ref>\n\nIn some subdomains of feminism, such as [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] feminism, gender is a major though not solitary axis along which factors of oppression are considered, as expressed by Dr Berkowitz, who wrote \"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

The term inherently lacks qualification of what does or does not constitute gender identity. Primarily, as its actualization is entirely internalized it prevents external parameterization or communication as those are external social behaviors. In a work titled Social Cognitive Theory of Gender Development and Differentiation by Doctors of Psychology, Kay Bussey and Alburta Bandura published in [[Psychological Review]] and [[Citation|academically cited]] approximately 2817 times<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-11924-002|title=APA PsycNet|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> (and thousands more in the citations to secondary literature on which the analysis is based), the pair review a variety of explanations for the modes and mechanism contributing to the cultivation of childhood gender identity. The first of which is a psychoanalytic theory stating:<blockquote>Initially, both boys and girls are believed to identify with their mothers. However, at between 3 and 5 years of age this changes, and children identify with the same-sex parent. Identification with the same-sex parent is pre-sumed to resolve the conflict children experience as a result of erotic attachment to the opposite-sex parent and jealousy toward the same-sex parent. This attachment causes children much anxiety as they fear retaliation from the same-sex parent.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bussey|first=Kay|last2=Bandura|first2=Albert|date=1999|title=Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=106|issue=4|pages=676\u2013713|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|issn=1939-1471}}</ref></blockquote>The principle contention being that gender differentiation in children is motivated by sexual attraction to the parent, as well as negative emotion, fear, and anxiety regarding threats or retaliation from the same-sex parent. In this, they also describe this as resulting in \"boys' castration anxieties.\" and \"[girls facing] resentment over being de-prived of a penis, inferior, and fear retaliation from the mother for their designs on their father.\" Bussey and Bandura do not provide in their research any study of the frequency of these fears or anxieties, nor any multi-varied analysis of peripheral factors to these feelings erotic or neurotic. Additionally, no description is provided of the methodology by which Bussey and Bandura derived any data from children to reach the conclusions of precisely the feelings being experienced during adolescent development, nor how children of age 5 were able to articulate their feelings at being \"deprived of a penis\". Additionally, no analysis or method is provided explaining how any of this information could be collected in testing the theory nor how the data could be assembled such as to provide a clinical model of childhood development.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n\nThey continue, providing cognitive-developmental analysis of their findings proposing that \"Gender identity is postulated as the basic organizer and regulator of children's gender learning\" and that \"children develop the stereo-typic conceptions of gender from what they see and hear around them\". Their works asserts that after children develop this concept, they also develop \"gender constancy\u2014the belief that their own gender is fixed and irreversible\". Children then act in a way that fulfills their conception, as cognitive consistency is gratifying. This model does not account for the fluidity of gender asserted by persons like American Psychologist [[Lisa M. Diamond]] who explains is not a stable, fixed trait \u2013 rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Butterworth|first2=Molly|date=2008-09|title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links Over Time|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=5-6|pages=365\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> This model directly contravenes both the notion of gender identity being individual and internal, by explaining its source as social behavior and its manifestation as a a desire for congruence with a received notion of gender. It is unclear whether this contradiction occurs as an inconsistency in terminology or as a contradiction of two claims.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOther proposed models include that of the Gender Schema Theory, which conjectures that the development of gender identity, is a process of self identification which must precede the ability for \"children to label themselves and others as males or females\". Bussey and Alburta note its similarity to the cognitive-developmental analysis, but do not clarify how these similarities manifest. They differ, however, in that the Gender Schema theory proposes the development of gender as a tool for developing children to better categorize and define the social behaviors around them, and contributes to the development of a growing and expanding model. Additionally, the cognitive-developmental analysis asserts that in a developing child the concept of gender is immutable once established, however the Gender Schema theory does not require this assumption, instead leaving the possibility that a developing child may refine and curtail their gendered differentiation according to experiences as they develop and thus produce a more nuanced and individual model than may have been initially received during early and uncontextualized adolescent experiences.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nFourth, Bussey and Bandura discuss the biological theory of gender differentiation. The various theories which follow this track as described include that gender differentation is motivated as a social manifestation of ancestrally inherited differences concerning \"mate preferences, reproductive strategies, parental investment in offspring, and the aggressive nature of males.\" In their analysis of these theories, these differences are discussed exclusively in the context of the males strategic advantage in mating multiple partners, as well as the capacity of males for coercive force in obtaining a mate. This context is an unusual one, and no elucidation is provided as to how or why this particular lens of understanding proto-civilization social dynamics of evolving humans was selected. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of humans back the the [[most recent common ancestor]] implies that the rate of reproductive success among females was significantly higher than males, in a journal published by the [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Favre|first=Maroussia|last2=Sornette|first2=Didier|date=2012-10|title=Strong gender differences in reproductive success variance, and the times to the most recent common ancestors|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002251931200313X|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=310|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.026}}</ref>. Additionally, further study relating to Darwins original work on sexual selectivity has indicated humans as a model species for analysis of sexual selection, specifically female sexual selection <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Ratterman|first2=Nicholas L.|date=2009-06-16|title=Mate choice and sexual selection: What have we learned since Darwin?|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/10001|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=Supplement 1|pages=10001\u201310008|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901129106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19528643}}</ref> as Darwin observed in On the Origins of Species that in most species sexually assertive males competed among themselves for the selection of choosy drab and coy female mates describing the process of both battle and pursuit as follows:<blockquote>The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not please or excite her; and when pursued, as so incessantly occurs, by several males, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with, or at least temporarily pairing with, some one male.</blockquote>Darwin and others after him however noticed the ornamentation of females to imply a difference in the human species, but this theory was largely ignored until recent contemporaries continue the work. This theory is further reinforced by the rapid evolutionary departure from chimpanzees, among whom females are not sexually selective and with lesser childhood burdens. It is for these reasons that a model of battle, rape, and a lack of male investment in offspring is inconsistent with prevailing scientific literature despite being a published work reflecting on the gender distinctions which derive as a result of ancestral sexual dynamics on an evolutionary timescale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/71284223|title=On the origins of species : by means of natural selection or the presevation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=2006|publisher=Folio Society|oclc=71284223}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the work of Bandura and Bussey, despite its prolific citation and endeavour to detail the mechanisms of of gender identity as a fact of childhood development, it is internally inconsistent, and contradictory to other relevant works on the topic and riddled with indications of bias or ulterior motives. See the presentation of Gender Schema as the only theory which presents gender differentiation as being of utility to the development of a child, and is still yet claimed as similar to the model which presents gender differentiation as an immutable and parasitic side effect of social imposition.\n\nThe study features intense, concentration on the sexual eroticism of children, and the existence of intense neurotic emotion in response to the absence or mutilation of same and opposite sex genitalia, but all this lacking any information as to how this information was extricated from subjects analyzed, or measure to prevent psychological projection onto malleable adolescent subjects in an environment where the subject matter is contended to be explicitly predicated on volatile neurotic emotional response to sexual social pressure from adult figures. Additionally, it lacks analysis of controls for selection bias or parental factors and is yet the first theory presented and analyzed by a child gender developmental study.\n\nThe work concerning evolutionary biological theories adopts a very specific lens, which describes the ancestral social paradigm as one predicated upon, rape, violence, and abandonment of females by their male counterparts which not only is absent all socio-cultural analysis and focused on hormonal patterns; but is also a model which directly contravenes the prevailing literature on sexual selectivity, evolution, and proto-civiliaztional social dynamics in humans. Additionally, it stands in contradiction to itself and other works which cite it, by the repeated conflation of bilogical sex, male and female, with gender, gender identity, and their confluence at the concepts of man and woman. \n\nThe broadly encompassing comprehensive work of Babdura and Bussey in their summary analysis reflect a complete internal inconsistency of the body of work it represents- which includes dozens of other oft cited studies referenced within itself- as well as total incongruence with prevailing scientific theory on adjacent subjects of biology in a form that is prolific and continuously cited decades after publication.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Sexuality/sexual orientation====\nIn recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is discovering and accepting their own sexuality/sexual orientation.

LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref>\n\n=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====\n\nGender is constructed for an individual based on the gendered interactions that the individual has with others, as well as, the other identities or roles they may hold. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every kind of social relationship where inequality is present.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".{{rp|96}}\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = A\u00edda | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = Signs: Women in Culture and Society| volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&ndash;855 | doi =  10.1086/494546| jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]</ref> Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\".<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref> For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women.

West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives.

In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained \u2013 \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\".<ref name=\"Mumby\">{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv }}</ref> In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby<ref name=\"Mumby\"/> argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior.

They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\" />{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent.

Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}</ref> that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis.

This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]], which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.<ref name=\"Martino\">{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}</ref> Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.<ref name=\"Martino\" /> This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. In their study, \"Correlates and Consequences of Peer Victimization: Gender Differences in Direct and Indirect Forms of Bullying,\" Lopez, Esbensen & Brick state that \"boys were more likely to experience direct or physical forms of bullying and girls were more likely to report being teased or joked about.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carbone-Lopez |first1=Kristin |last2=Esbensen |first2=Finn-Aage |last3=Brick |first3=Bradley T. |title=Correlates and Consequences of Peer Victimization: Gender Differences in Direct and Indirect Forms of Bullying |journal=Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice |date=2010 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=343 |doi=10.1177/1541204010362954 }}</ref> This can be interpreted as females typically harassing other females in more of a mental, emotional, and psychological torment while males take more of a physical and aggressive approach.

Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students.\n\n===Adolescent view of adulthood===\n\nGender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \"maleness and to power to domination\u201d, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 | language = en | url = https://archive.org/details/femalemasculinit00judi | isbn = 9780822322436 | url-access = registration }}</ref> In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = \"I always felt I had to prove my manhood\": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | pmc=4265897}}</ref> These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.\n\nAdolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and \"unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\">{{cite book | last = Mortimer | first = Jeylan | title = Working and growing up in America | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780674016149 }}</ref> Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation.  In the book ''Working and Growing Up in America'', Jeylan T. Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\" /> This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv }}</ref> This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\n===Depression===\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to \"cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Susman | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Pubertal timing, depression, and externalizing problems: a framework, review, and examination of gender differences | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 717&ndash;746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x | date = September 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> One of these psychological problems is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is [[psychological well-being]].

Higher levels of [[testosterone]] are associated with increased [[aggression]] in boys and girls, whereas higher [[estrogen]] for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\"/> The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students.

As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to [[psychological well-being]] during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"Winefield\">{{cite journal | last1 = Delfabbro | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = Winefield | first2 = Anthony H. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Hammarstr\u00f6m | first4 = Anne | last5 = Winefield | first5 = Helen | title = Body image and psychological well-being in adolescents: the relationship between gender and school type | journal = [[The Journal of Genetic Psychology]] | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&ndash;83 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.517812 | pmid = 21452753 | date = 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> In the article \"Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type\", Helen Winfield explains that an adolescent's high school experience is closely linked to their perceived [[body image]].

These psychological problems can manifest into eating disorders causing serious lifelong problems.<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> Due to these findings, it is shown that these body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]], expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.  Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G.

Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/|title=Foucault, Michel: Political Thought {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe work [[The Blank Slate]] of Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \"money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\" which \"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\" However, they are not a support of the Social Constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}</ref> In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the [[Tabula rasa]] theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions.\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:<ref name=\"Alsop_Theorizing\">{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}</ref>\n# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;\n# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.\n\n===Gender===\n{{main|Gender}}\nHistorically gender was used as means describing the distinction between the biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity.<ref name=\"Marecek, Crawford & Popp\">{{cite book | last1 = Marecek | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Crawford | first2 = Mary | last3 = Popp | first3 = Danielle | chapter = On the construction of gender, sex, and sexualities | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-009 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 192&ndash;216 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref> According to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\"<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]\n:* {{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Doing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA3 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 3&ndash;25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>{{rp|126}}\n\nAs a social construct, gender is considered an achieved status by feminist theory, typically (though not exclusively) one which is achieved very early in childhood. The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

The term inherently lacks qualification of what does or does not constitute gender identity. Primarily, as its actualization is entirely internalized it prevents external parameterization or communication as those are external social behaviors. In a work titled Social Cognitive Theory of Gender Development and Differentiation by Doctors of Psychology, Kay Bussey and Alburta Bandura published in [[Psychological Review]] and [[Citation|academically cited]] approximately 2817 times<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-11924-002|title=APA PsycNet|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> (and thousands more in the citations to secondary literature on which the analysis is based), the pair review a variety of explanations for the modes and mechanism contributing to the cultivation of childhood gender identity. The first of which is a psychoanalytic theory stating:<blockquote>Initially, both boys and girls are believed to identify with their mothers. However, at between 3 and 5 years of age this changes, and children identify with the same-sex parent. Identification with the same-sex parent is pre-sumed to resolve the conflict children experience as a result of erotic attachment to the opposite-sex parent and jealousy toward the same-sex parent. This attachment causes children much anxiety as they fear retaliation from the same-sex parent.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bussey|first=Kay|last2=Bandura|first2=Albert|date=1999|title=Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=106|issue=4|pages=676\u2013713|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|issn=1939-1471}}</ref></blockquote>The principle contention being that gender differentiation in children is motivated by sexual attraction to the parent, as well as negative emotion, fear, and anxiety regarding threats or retaliation from the same-sex parent. In this, they also describe this as resulting in \"boys' castration anxieties.\" and \"[girls facing] resentment over being de-prived of a penis, inferior, and fear retaliation from the mother for their designs on their father.\" Bussey and Bandura do not provide in their research any study of the frequency of these fears or anxieties, nor any multi-varied analysis of peripheral factors to these feelings erotic or neurotic. Additionally, no description is provided of the methodology by which Bussey and Bandura derived any data from children to reach the conclusions of precisely the feelings being experienced during adolescent development, nor how children of age 5 were able to articulate their feelings at being \"deprived of a penis\". Additionally, no analysis or method is provided explaining how any of this information could be collected in testing the theory nor how the data could be assembled such as to provide a clinical model of childhood development.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n\nThey continue, providing cognitive-developmental analysis of their findings proposing that \"Gender identity is postulated as the basic organizer and regulator of children's gender learning\" and that \"children develop the stereo-typic conceptions of gender from what they see and hear around them\". Their works asserts that after children develop this concept, they also develop \"gender constancy\u2014the belief that their own gender is fixed and irreversible\". Children then act in a way that fulfills their conception, as cognitive consistency is gratifying. This model does not account for the fluidity of gender asserted by persons like American Psychologist [[Lisa M. Diamond]] who explains is not a stable, fixed trait \u2013 rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Butterworth|first2=Molly|date=2008-09|title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links Over Time|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=5-6|pages=365\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> This model directly contravenes both the notion of gender identity being individual and internal, by explaining its source as social behavior and its manifestation as a a desire for congruence with a received notion of gender. It is unclear whether this contradiction occurs as an inconsistency in terminology or as a contradiction of two claims.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOther proposed models include that of the Gender Schema Theory, which conjectures that the development of gender identity, is a process of self identification which must precede the ability for \"children to label themselves and others as males or females\". Bussey and Alburta note its similarity to the cognitive-developmental analysis, but do not clarify how these similarities manifest. They differ, however, in that the Gender Schema theory proposes the development of gender as a tool for developing children to better categorize and define the social behaviors around them, and contributes to the development of a growing and expanding model. Additionally, the cognitive-developmental analysis asserts that in a developing child the concept of gender is immutable once established, however the Gender Schema theory does not require this assumption, instead leaving the possibility that a developing child may refine and curtail their gendered differentiation according to experiences as they develop and thus produce a more nuanced and individual model than may have been initially received during early and uncontextualized adolescent experiences.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n\n\nFourth, Bussey and Bandura discuss the biological theory of gender differentiation. The various theories which follow this track as described include that gender differentation is motivated as a social manifestation of ancestrally inherited differences concerning \"mate preferences, reproductive strategies, parental investment in offspring, and the aggressive nature of males.\" In their analysis of these theories, these differences are discussed exclusively in the context of the males strategic advantage in mating multiple partners, as well as the capacity of males for coercive force in obtaining a mate. This context is an unusual one, and no elucidation is provided as to how or why this particular lens of understanding proto-civilization social dynamics of evolving humans was selected. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of humans back the the [[most recent common ancestor]] implies that the rate of reproductive success among females was significantly higher than males, in a journal published by the [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Favre|first=Maroussia|last2=Sornette|first2=Didier|date=2012-10|title=Strong gender differences in reproductive success variance, and the times to the most recent common ancestors|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002251931200313X|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=310|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.026}}</ref>. Additionally, further study relating to Darwins original work on sexual selectivity has indicated humans as a model species for analysis of sexual selection, specifically female sexual selection <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Ratterman|first2=Nicholas L.|date=2009-06-16|title=Mate choice and sexual selection: What have we learned since Darwin?|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/10001|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=Supplement 1|pages=10001\u201310008|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901129106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19528643}}</ref> as Darwin observed in On the Origins of Species that in most species sexually assertive males competed among themselves for the selection of choosy drab and coy female mates describing the process of both battle and pursuit as follows:<blockquote>The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not please or excite her; and when pursued, as so incessantly occurs, by several males, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with, or at least temporarily pairing with, some one male.</blockquote>Darwin and others after him however noticed the ornamentation of females to imply a difference in the human species, but this theory was largely ignored until recent contemporaries continue the work. This theory is further reinforced by the rapid evolutionary departure from chimpanzees, among whom females are not sexually selective and with lesser childhood burdens. It is for these reasons that a model of battle, rape, and a lack of male investment in offspring seems inappropriate for an article reflecting on the gender distinctions which derive as a result of ancestral sexual dynamics on an evolutionary timescale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/71284223|title=On the origins of species : by means of natural selection or the presevation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=2006|publisher=Folio Society|oclc=71284223}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the work of Bandura and Bussey, despite its prolific citation and endeavour to detail the mechanisms of of gender identity as a fact of childhood development, it is internally inconsistent, and contradictory to other relevant works on the topic and riddled with indications of bias or ulterior motives. See the presentation of Gender Schema as the only theory which presents gender differentiation as being of utility to the development of a child, and is still yet claimed as similar to the model which presents gender differentiation as an immutable and parasitic side effect of social imposition.\n\nThe study features intense, concentration on the sexual eroticism of children, and the existence of intense neurotic emotion in response to the absence or mutilation of same and opposite sex genitalia, but all this lacking any information as to how this information was extricated from subjects analyzed, or measure to prevent psychological projection onto malleable adolescent subjects in an environment where the subject matter is contended to be explicitly predicated on volatile neurotic emotional response to sexual social pressure from adult figures. Additionally, it lacks analysis of controls for selection bias or parental factors and is yet the first theory presented and analyzed by a child gender developmental study.\n\nThe work concerning evolutionary biological theories adopts a very specific lens, which describes the ancestral social paradigm as one predicated upon, rape, violence, and abandonment of females by their male counterparts which not only is absent all socio-cultural analysis and focused on hormonal patterns; but is also a model which directly contravenes the prevailing literature on sexual selectivity, evolution, and proto-civiliaztional social dynamics in humans. Additionally, it stands in contradiction to itself and other works which cite it, by the repeated conflation of bilogical sex, male and female, with gender, gender identity, and their confluence at the concepts of man and woman. \n\nThe broadly encompassing comprehensive work of Babdura and Bussey in their summary analysis reflect a complete internal inconsistency of the body of work it represents- which includes dozens of other oft cited studies referenced within itself- as well as total incongruence with prevailing scientific theory on adjacent subjects of biology in a form that is prolific and continuously cited decades after publication.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Sexuality/sexual orientation====\nIn recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is discovering and accepting their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan|first=Jill M. and Caitlin L.|date=December 2016|title=Queering Chapter Books with LGBT Characters for Young Readers: Recognizing and Complicating Representations of Homonormativity|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=37|issue=6|pages=846\u2013866|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete|doi=10.1080/01596306.2014.940234}}</ref> The authors characterize this style of representation as \"homonormative\", and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a trans man or that they were simply pretending.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDiamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviewing women that fall into a sexual minority group over the course of ten years.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine \"stance\" and started to question her gender identity.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Reply - (re)doing difference | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA95 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 95&ndash;104 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>\n\nThe perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender. Heterosexuality is assumed for those individuals who appear to act appropriately masculine or appropriately feminine.

LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref>\n\n=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====\n\nGender is constructed for an individual based on the gendered interactions that the individual has with others, as well as, the other identities or roles they may hold. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every kind of social relationship where inequality is present.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".{{rp|96}}\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = A\u00edda | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = Signs: Women in Culture and Society| volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&ndash;855 | doi =  10.1086/494546| jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]</ref> Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\".<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref> For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women. White women are accountable for their gendered display as traditionally subservient to white men while women of color may be held accountable for their gendered performance as sexual objects and as [[wikt:recalcitrant|recalcitrant]] and [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] women in relations with white men. West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives. In other words, individual perceptions of \"\"knowledge\" or reality...must be the central focus.\"<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|url=http://perflensburg.se/Berger%20social-construction-of-reality.pdf|title=The social construction of reality : a treatise in the sociology of knowledge|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|publisher=Penguin|year=1966|isbn=9780141931630|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThese performances normalize the essentialism of sex categories. In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained \u2013 \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\".<ref name=\"Mumby\">{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv }}</ref> In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby<ref name=\"Mumby\"/> argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.).\n\n====Accountability====\n\nPeople hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\" />{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|24}}\n\n[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}</ref> that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121\u2013127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|pmid=21257109|issn=1054-139X}}</ref> Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.\n\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Julia|date=Fall 1992|title=AIDS, Stigma, and Narratives of Containment|journal=American Imago|volume=49|issue=3|pages=293\u2013310|jstor=26304009}}</ref>\n\nQueer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as \"failure\" on the part of their character.

This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]], which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.<ref name=\"Martino\">{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}</ref> Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.<ref name=\"Martino\" /> This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset.

Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity.

Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique \u2013 no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations.

{"title_page": "Symplectic integrator", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''symplectic integrator (SI)''' is a [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical integration scheme]] for [[Hamiltonian system]]s. Symplectic integrators form the subclass of [[geometric integrator]]s which, by definition, are [[canonical transformation]]s. They are widely used in [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[discrete element method]]s, [[particle accelerator|accelerator physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[quantum physics]], and [[celestial mechanics]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nSymplectic integrators are designed for the numerical solution of [[Hamilton's equations]], which read\n:<math>\\dot p = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad \\dot q = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p},</math>\nwhere <math>q</math> denotes the position coordinates, <math>p</math> the momentum coordinates, and <math>H</math> is the Hamiltonian. \nThe set of position and momentum coordinates <math>(q,p)</math> are called [[canonical coordinates]].\n(See [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] for more background.)\n\nThe time evolution of [[Hamilton's equations]] is a [[symplectomorphism]], meaning that it conserves the symplectic [[two-form]] <math>dp \\wedge dq</math>. A numerical scheme is a symplectic integrator if it also conserves this two-form.\n\nSymplectic integrators possess, as a conserved quantity, a Hamiltonian which is slightly [[perturbation theory|perturbed]] from the original one. By virtue of these advantages, the SI scheme has been widely applied to the calculations of long-term evolution of chaotic Hamiltonian systems ranging from the [[Kepler problem]] to the classical and semi-classical simulations in [[molecular dynamics]].\n\nMost of the usual numerical methods, like the primitive [[Euler integration|Euler scheme]] and the classical [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods|Runge\u2013Kutta scheme]], are not symplectic integrators.\n\n== Methods for constructing symplectic algorithms ==\n=== Splitting methods for separable Hamiltonians ===\n\nA widely used class of symplectic integrators is formed by the splitting methods.\n\nAssume that the Hamiltonian is separable, meaning that it can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\nH(p,q) = T(p) + V(q). \\qquad\\qquad (1)\n</math>\n\nThis happens frequently in Hamiltonian mechanics, with ''T'' being the [[kinetic energy]] and ''V'' the [[potential energy]].\n\nFor the notational simplicity, let us introduce the symbol <math>z=(q,p)</math> to denote the canonical coordinates \nincluding both the position and momentum coordinates. Then, the set of the Hamilton's equations given in the introduction can be expressed in a single expression as\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{z}=\\{z,H(z)\\}, \\qquad\\qquad (2)\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\{\\cdot, \\cdot\\}</math> is a [[Poisson bracket]]. Furthermore, by introducing an operator <math>D_H \\cdot = \\{\\cdot, H\\}</math>, which returns a [[Poisson bracket]] of the operand with the [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]], the expression of the Hamilton's equation can be further simplified to\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{z}=D_H z.\n</math>\n\nThe formal solution of this set of equations is given as a [[matrix exponential]]:\n\n:<math>\nz(\\tau)=\\exp(\\tau D_H)z(0). \\qquad\\qquad (3) \n</math>\nNote the  positivity of <math> \\tau D_H </math> in the matrix exponential.\n\nWhen the Hamiltonian has the form of eq. (1), the solution (3) is equivalent to\n\n:<math>\nz(\\tau) = \\exp[\\tau (D_T + D_V)]z(0). \\qquad\\qquad (4)\n</math>\n\nThe SI scheme approximates the time-evolution operator <math>\\exp[\\tau (D_T + D_V)]</math> in the formal solution (4) by a product of operators as\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\exp[\\tau (D_T + D_V)] & = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\exp(c_i \\tau D_T)\\exp(d_i \\tau D_V) + O(\\tau^{k+1}) \\\\\n&= \\exp(c_1 \\tau D_T)\\exp(d_1 \\tau D_V)\\dots\\exp(c_k \\tau D_T)\\exp(d_k \\tau D_V) + O(\\tau^{k+1}),\n\\end{align} \\qquad\\qquad (5)\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>c_i</math> and <math>d_i</math> are real numbers, <math>k</math> is an integer, which is called the order of the integrator, and where <math>\\sum_{i=1}^k c_i = \\sum_{i=1}^k d_i = 1</math>. Note that each of the operators <math>\\exp(c_i \\tau D_T)</math> and <math>\\exp(d_i \\tau D_V)</math> provides a [[symplectic map]], so their product appearing in the right-hand side of (5) also constitutes a symplectic map.\n\nSince <math>D_T^2 z = \\{\\{z,T\\},T\\} = \\{(\\dot{q}, 0),T\\} = (0,0)</math> for all <math>z</math>, we can conclude that\n\n:<math>\nD_T^2 = 0. \\qquad\\qquad (6)\n</math>\n\nBy using a Taylor series, <math>\\exp(a D_T)</math> can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\n\\exp(a D_T) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(a D_T)^n}{n!}, \\qquad\\qquad (7)\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> is an arbitrary real number. Combining (6) and (7), and by using the same reasoning for <math>D_V</math> as we have used for <math>D_T</math>, we get\n\n:<math>\\left\\{\\begin{align}\n \\exp(a D_T) &= 1 + a D_T, \\\\\n \\exp(a D_V) &= 1 + a D_V.\n\\end{align}\\right. \\qquad\\qquad (8)\n</math>\n\nIn concrete terms, <math>\\exp(c_i \\tau D_T)</math> gives the mapping\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n q \\\\ p\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\mapsto\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n q + \\tau c_i \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p}(p)\\\\\n p\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nand <math>\\exp(d_i \\tau D_V)</math> gives\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n q \\\\ p\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\mapsto\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n q \\\\\n p - \\tau d_i \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q}(q)\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nNote that both of these maps are practically computable.\n\n==== Examples ====\nThe simplified form of the equations (in executed order) are:\n\n:<math>q_{i+1} = q_{i} + c_{i} \\frac{p_{i+1}}{m}t</math>\n:<math>p_{i+1} = p_{i} + d_{i} F(q_{i}) t</math>\n\nAfter converting into Lagrangian coordinates:\n\n:<math>x_{i+1} = x_{i} + c_{i} v_{i+1} t</math>\n:<math>v_{i+1} = v_{i} + d_{i} a(x_{i}) t</math>\n\nWhere <math>F(x)</math> is the force vector at <math>x</math>, <math>a(x)</math> is the acceleration vector at <math>x</math>, and <math>m</math> is the scalar quantity of mass.\n\nSeveral symplectic integrators are given below.

A numerical scheme is a symplectic integrator if it also conserves this two-form.\n\nSymplectic integrators possess, as a conserved quantity, a Hamiltonian which is slightly [[perturbation theory|perturbed]] from the original one. By virtue of these advantages, the SI scheme has been widely applied to the calculations of long-term evolution of chaotic Hamiltonian systems ranging from the [[Kepler problem]] to the classical and semi-classical simulations in [[molecular dynamics]].\n\nMost of the usual numerical methods, like the primitive [[Euler integration|Euler scheme]] and the classical [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods|Runge\u2013Kutta scheme]], are not symplectic integrators.\n\n== Methods for constructing symplectic algorithms ==\n=== Splitting methods for separable Hamiltonians ===\n\nA widely used class of symplectic integrators is formed by the splitting methods.\n\nAssume that the Hamiltonian is separable, meaning that it can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\nH(p,q) = T(p) + V(q). \\qquad\\qquad (1)\n</math>\n\nThis happens frequently in Hamiltonian mechanics, with ''T'' being the [[kinetic energy]] and ''V'' the [[potential energy]].\n\nFor the notational simplicity, let us introduce the symbol <math>z=(q,p)</math> to denote the canonical coordinates \nincluding both the position and momentum coordinates.

Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region.

By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''.

According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well.

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and a nearby [[Thermal bath|spa]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 2,604 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], Srebrenica was the site of a [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of more than 8,000 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern [[wikt:srebro|srebro]] \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''. Prag: Verl. der K\u00f6n. B\u00f6hmischen Ges. der Wiss., 1879</ref> During the 14th century, many German miners moved into the area.<ref>Mihailo Dini\u0107: ''Za istoriju rudarstva u srednjevekovnoj Srbiji i Bosni'', S. 46</ref>  There were often armed conflicts about Srebrenica because of its mines. According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"}}\n\n====British Army Documents Declassified in 2019====\n\nThe British National Archives in Kew released the documents dating back to July 1995 which deal with communication between British military and political actors during the Bosnian war. \n\nSeveral of the reports appear to blame the Bosniak Army (BiH) for provoking the Srebrenica attack. British intelligence doubted that Pale (Bosnian Serb headquarters) had any plans to overrun Srebrenica. Instead, the manoeuvre came as a response due to repeated Bosniak Army (BiH) attacks on BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) supply lines.\n\n{{quotation|The recent BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) attack on Srebrenica enclave was prompted by constant BiH (Bosniak Army) attacks over the previous 3 months on BSA supply route to the south of the enclave.

{"title_page": "List of Gargoyles characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nIn the animated television series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' and the spinoff comic books ''[[Gargoyles (SLG comic)]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (SLG comic)|Gargoyles: Bad Guys]]'', '''Gargoyles''' are a species of winged humanoid creatures that are the focus of the show.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gargoyles==\nSeveral clans of gargoyles exist worldwide, and each clan has distinct cultural and morphological characteristics. All gargoyle clans are alike in that each has a particular item, area, or concept that they strive to protect. They are fierce warriors and are incredibly powerful and resilient; their appearance and ferocity often means that humans vilify them as demons and monsters. Most of the world's gargoyle clans do not peacefully co-exist with humans.\n\nGargoyles are particularly notable for entering a sort of stone [[hibernation]], called \"stone sleep\", during the day, during which they resemble Gothic statues. During daylight, they can quickly heal from injury and illness, and are protected from most natural threats. However, this state makes them easy targets for destruction by their enemies and humans who hate them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> The character Anton Sevarius postulated that, in this hibernation, they absorb solar radiation that allows them to store energy; otherwise, he concluded, the strenuous activity of gliding would require a nutritional intake equivalent to eating three cows a day.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> Damage during stone sleep can be fatal to a gargoyle. If a gargoyle dies during its hibernation, its body will remain stone.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/>\n\nGargoyles, despite having large wings, can only fly by [[Gliding flight|gliding]] on [[Vertical draft|updrafts]] and on the [[wind]]. They have sharp claws that can dig into any kind of solid surface, and they can use these to climb vertical surfaces.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> They are also excellent swimmers.\n\nWhile not inherently immortal, gargoyles can be extremely long-lived, a result of stone sleep\u2014which slows or halts their aging process until they wake again the following night. Even in old age, they are not as frail and incapacitated as other creatures. Because they spend half their day asleep as stone, they age at half the rate of a human, thus living twice as long.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 44 Grief\"/>\n\n===The Manhattan Clan===\nThe '''Manhattan Clan''' are the [[protagonist]]s of the series.\n\n* '''[[Goliath (Gargoyles)|Goliath]]''' (voiced by [[Keith David]])&nbsp;\u2013 Goliath is the leader of the Manhattan Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> Goliath is named for the [[Goliath|Biblical giant]] by the people of Castle Wyvern because of his stature at 6&nbsp;ft. 10&nbsp;in. (208&nbsp;cm) and a weight of 400&nbsp;lbs. (181&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> By the end of the second season, Goliath has started a romantic relationship with Elisa Maza.\n* '''Hudson''' (voiced by [[Ed Asner]])&nbsp;\u2013 Hudson was an Elder and former leader of the Wyvern Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> He now serves as an advisor to Goliath and the rest of the Manhattan Clan. Hudson took his name from the [[Hudson River|river]] after Elisa explained almost everything has a name.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/>\n* '''Brooklyn''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 The [[rufous]]-skinned, white-haired Brooklyn serves as the clan's second-in-command<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 30 Upgrade\"/> with a somewhat sarcastic and impetuous attitude, but has a talent for [[military tactics|tactics]]. Brooklyn is named for the [[Brooklyn|New York borough]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> He harbors bitter hatred against [[Demona]] after she tricked him. Forty seconds after being whisked away in time by The [[Phoenix Gate]] (but 40 years later, from Brooklyn's perspective), Brooklyn was returned to his correct time, older and with a family.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Lexington''' (voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]])&nbsp;\u2013 Lexington was the smallest of the clan and a technical wizard. Lexington is named from the [[Lexington Avenue|avenue]], which itself [[Lexington Avenue#History|gained that name in 1836]].<ref name=\"STREETBOOK\">Henry Moscow:''The Street Book''.

He holds a soft spot for baby Alex; in the third season, he is shown to act as a sort of babysitter and spoils him with new toys. Following the series' run on television and the release of the SLG ''Clan-Building'' Gargoyles comics, Weisman himself has hinted that Lexington may be of same-sex preference, but unrecognized by the character himself at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=8065 |title=Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles! |page=8065 |last1=Weisman |first1=Greg |date=May 5, 2005  |website=s8.org |publisher=Station Eight |access-date=April 10, 2016 |quote=\"Greg responds...'I think the blurb you quoted MIS-represented what I said at that Gathering.

Broadway is named for the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|street]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> Broadway has developed a strong dislike of [[guns]] and a great appreciation for old movies (particularly detective ones),<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 8 Deadly Force\"/> as well as a newfound and rapidly developing appreciation for reading and literary works.  He later develops a relationship with Angela.\n* '''Bronx''' (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bronx is a dog-like gargoyle beast. Bronx is named for the [[The Bronx|New York borough]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> He often stays with Hudson within the clan's residence, keeping him company while watching television.\n* '''Angela''' (voiced by [[Brigitte Bako]])&nbsp;\u2013 Angela is the daughter of Goliath<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 40 Monsters\"/> and Demona.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/> She was raised on Avalon like a human, thus making her more willing to trust others,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> and joined the Manhattan clan in the middle of the second season. Angela is so named because of her [[angel]]ic nature,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> Angela literally meaning \"She-Angel\".  She later develops a relationship with Broadway, after letting \"the trio\" (Broadway, Brooklyn and Lexington) know she does not tolerate nicknames being used for her.\n* '''Fu-Dog'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fu-Dog is a green-skinned leonine gargoyle beast, closely resembling a [[Chinese guardian lions|Chinese statuary lion]] in appearance from the [[Shangdu|Xanadu]] Clan in China who, at some unspecified time, joins Brooklyn on his journey through the time-stream. He is fiercely loyal to Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Katana'''&nbsp;\u2013 Katana comes from the Ishimura Clan during feudal era Japan, and is Brooklyn's sky-blue hued mate, with a similar but smaller beak when compared to her mate. Named for the [[Katana|most famous form of Japanese sword]], she joined him on his Timedancer journey. During their adventures, she and Brooklyn had an egg which hatched into Nashville. She has a second egg, Egwardo, which she is very protective of, as shown by her carrying it (before it hatches in 1998) with her everywhere in a compact backpack.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Nashville'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nashville is the son of Brooklyn and Katana. He closely resembled Brooklyn, but had Katana's pale blue skin color and bluish-black hair. He is called '''Gnash''' for short.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Egwardo'''&nbsp;\u2013 Egwardo is a yet-to-be-hatched gargoyle egg. Its parents were Brooklyn and Katana.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>  Egwardo hatched as a female in 1998, and was given the name \"Tachi\", possibly named for the [[Tachi|predecessor of the sword her mother is named for]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=6538\n| title = Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles!\n| page = 6538\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = December 3, 2003\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n* '''Othello''' (voiced by [[Michael Dorn]])&nbsp;\u2013 Othello was a rookery brother to Goliath who is shown to be hot-headed.

Eventually, each personality is transferred to a separate robotic body.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 62 Possession\"/>  Since the Coldstone robotic body only had one voice box, Coldstone was always voiced by Dorn, regardless of the personality in control; however, in \"Legion\" Coldstone's tone changed whenever Desdemona was in control.\n\n===Iago/Coldsteel===\n'''Iago''' or '''Coldsteel''' is Othello's enemy.  He convinced Othello that Desdemona was secretly pursuing a relationship with Goliath.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 16 Legion\"/>  He was eventually transferred into the robot shell of Coldsteel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 62 Possession\"/>  Upon Demona's reactivation of the Coldstone robot, Iago took control of the body, until Othello was convinced to help Goliath and clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 26 High Noon\"/>  In 1996, Coldsteel aided Xanatos and Coyote 5.0. in retrieving the Stone of Destiny, in exchange for removing a tracking device from his body.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> The name Iago was used only in the script and credits.<ref name=\"greg 3563\"/> Voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]].\n\n===Demona===\n{{Main|Demona}}\n'''Demona''' (voiced by [[Marina Sirtis]]) - Goliath's former mate<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and Angela's biological mother;<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/> who is no longer frozen in stone by daylight  like the others, thanks to Puck's pre-Gathering intervention.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 18 The Mirror\"/> She has been continuously alive for a millennium, because of a magical pact with [[Macbeth (Gargoyles)|Macbeth]] granted to them by the series' version of the [[List of Gargoyles characters#The Weird Sisters|Three Witches]], giving both of them nearly-irrevocable immortality. Demona developed a hatred of all humans, making her an enemy of the clan. She was named by Macbeth, after her [[Demon|demonic]] fighting skills,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Demona literally meaning \"She-Demon\". Over the centuries that she has been alive, Demona was the enemy of the Canmore family, who all took on the moniker of The Hunter; because of this, Demona was indirectly responsible for the destruction of the Manhattan Clan's clock tower home.\n\n===Avalon Clan===\nThe '''[[Avalon Clan]]''' are the gargoyle eggs of Castle Wyvern that were protected by Princess Katharine, Tom, and the Magus. The eggs were taken to [[Places in Disney's Gargoyles|Avalon]], where they hatched and grew to adulthood.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> Members of the clan include Gabriel (the son of Coldstone and Coldfire), Ophelia, the gargoyle beast Boudicca, and other unnamed members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 55 Ill Met By Moonlight\"/> Katharine and Tom raised them as their own children, and thus gave each a name to be told apart from each other, so the Avalon Clan holds great respect for them.\n\n===London Clan===\nThe '''London Clan''' are a prosperous [[England|English]] clan resembling the creatures of [[heraldry]]. The London Clan roosted at a country estate called Knight's Spur.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> They also ran a magic shop in [[London]] to supplement their income, and until the mid-1990s (the timeframe of the ''Gargoyles'' series) had abandoned their mission of protection. Their names were derived from the heraldic creatures they were based on: Leo ([[lion]]), Leo's mate Una ([[unicorn]], and the clan's leader), Griff ([[griffin]]),<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 43&nbsp;M.I.A.\"/> Staghart ([[White stag#Symbolism|stag]], [http://gargwiki.net/Staghart rumored to have a close friendship with Lexington]), Constance ([[Pig|sow]]), Old Pog ([[hippogriff]]) as the clan's eldest member, Lunette ([[winged unicorn]], as she is Leo and Una's daughter, born the same year as Brooklyn's son Nashville) and 189 other members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\n===Clan Ishimura===\n'''Clan Ishimura''' was a gargoyle clan in [[Japan]] and the only clan thus far that lived in harmony with humans, teaching them ''[[Bushido]]'', (lit. the \"Way of the Warrior\"), since feudal times. It includes Kai, (lit. \"The [[Ocean]]\" or \"The [[Sea]]\"), the Clan leader, Sora, (lit. \"The [[Sky]]\" or \"The [[Heaven]]s\"), Yama (lit. \"The [[Mountain]]\"), who was banished from the clan for criminal activity \u2014 resulting in his joining Robyn Canmore's ''Redemption Squad'' unit in the future to atone for his own  misdeeds \u2014 and many other unnamed members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 53 Bushido\"/> In the ''Gargoyles'' comic series issue \"The Lost\", it is revealed that the gargoyles of Japan are properly called [http://gargwiki.net/Tengu tengu], as a possible inspiration for [[Tengu|Japan's folkloric creatures]] with similar physical characteristics.\n\n===Guatemala Clan===\nThe '''Guatemala Clan''' members are protectors of the Guatemalan rainforest and associated with the [[Kaqchikel people]]'s culture. The four surviving gargoyles of the clan wore special talismans linked to a special occultly-enchanted artifact called the Mayan Sun Amulet, that let them avoid their stone sleep. Their names are [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words for precious [[gemstones]]\u2014 the red-skinned, legless Zafiro ([[sapphire]]) as the clan's leader, with a unique feather-winged appearance reminiscent of the Mayan deity [[Kukulkan]] but with human-form arms, or possibly one of the cuoatl, specifically [[Quetzalcoatl]], the winged serpent; the green-skinned Jade (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0251\u02d0|d|e\u026a}} {{respell|HAH|day}}, as it would be pronounced in Spanish) with a facial appearance reminiscent of Goliath; and the blue-skinned females Turquesa ([[turquoise]]); and Obsidiana ([[obsidian]]), who has developed skills as an herbalist (similar to Maya [[ethnobotanist|ethnobotany]]) with medicinal plants of the rain forest, in healing physical injuries. Due to malicious business actions initiated in 1993 by the Cyberbiotics Corporation's Preston Vogel in and near the clan's rain forest protectorate (see below), a sizable number of the Guatemala Clan's earlier gargoyle membership was destroyed in stone slumber only a few years before the \"Avalon World Tour\" visit to them by Goliath, Angela, Elisa and Bronx; without the Guatemala Clan's rookery of gargoyle eggs ever being discovered in the tragic event.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 51 The Green\"/>\n\n===Labyrinth Clan===\nThe '''Labyrinth Clan''' lived underground, protecting the homeless individuals who also lived there.\n\n====The Mutates====\nThe '''Mutates''' were created when Sevarius combined animal genes with humans in an attempt to create gargoyle-like creatures for Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> They rebelled against Xanatos,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> and now protect the homeless in the underground facility known as the Labyrinth.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 39 Kingdom\"/> They also take care of the clones. All the Mutates resembled humanoid cats with bat-like wings on their backs (giving them enough strength to glide), and had the ability to store and discharge electricity, due to having electric eel DNA and the associated storage organ to naturally accumulate an electric charge.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/>\n;Talon\n:'''Talon''' became the leader of the Mutate Clan; originally, he was against leadership as he preferred everyone being equal, but took control when Fang attempted mutiny. Resembled a black panther hybrid. Talon was originally Derek Maza, Elisa Maza's younger brother. He took a job as a pilot for David Xanatos, with a series of events leading to his mutation. The mutate Maggie Reed is shown to love him, and the feeling is mutual.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> Voiced by [[Rocky Carroll]].\n;Fang\n:'''Fang''' was originally a member of the Mutate Clan but eventually betrayed them. He resembled a puma hybrid with bat wings. Fang was a human named Fred Sykes before Sevarius mutated him. He found several laser rifles and used them and a pair of human followers to attempt to take over the Labyrinth where the mutates lived.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 39 Kingdom\"/> He later joined forces with Thailog and Demona.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 48 Pendragon\"/> He is a loud mouthed bully who likes dominating those weaker than himself,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> which causes Yama to become antagonistic towards him as both Yama and Fang are eventual members of Robyn Canmore's ''Redemption Squad''. He is voiced by [[James Belushi]].\n;Claw\n:'''Claw''' is a strong-but-silent Mutate.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> The transformation process rendered him [[Speech disorder|mute]], brought on by either physical damage or psychological trauma (it is never specified). Resembled a tiger hybrid.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> Claw is shown to be a coward, doing what he is told out of fear; however, he has brief moments of bravery.\n;Maggie Reed\n:'''Maggie Reed''' is an innocent young homeless woman who was tricked by Sevarius, she was the most desperate to find a cure for her condition. Brooklyn had a crush on her for a time,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> but she fell in love with Talon/Derek.  Maggie was listed in the show's credits as ''Maggie the Cat'', an allusion to the female lead in the play ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. Maggie was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]. Maggie resembled a lion hybrid.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> In the comic continuation, it was revealed that she was pregnant with Talon's child.\n\n=====Non-combat Mutates=====\nTo continue with his experiments in mutating, Sevarius and Fang abducted four residents of the Labyrinth.\n;Thug\n:'''Thug''' was in charge of guarding Fang's cell, before he was freed by Sevarius.  Mutated into a human [[crocodile]].  He took the two kids back to the Labyrinth.\n;Tasha\n:'''Tasha''' was a woman who was mutated into a human [[armadillo]].  She committed suicide after discovering that Sevarius had no intent to cure them.\n;Benny\n:'''Benny''' is a boy who was mutated into a human [[woodlouse]].\n;Erin\n:'''Erin''' is a girl who was mutated into a human [[turtle]].  She is Benny's older sister.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\nBoth Benny and Erin are modeled after Greg Weisman's kids.

Their intellects were originally deliberately stunted to make them obedient to Thailog, but with Thailog's supposed death they regained their freedom. Talon offered to take the clones with him to the Labyrinth to educate them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 61 The Reckoning\"/>  Issues 3 to 5 of the comic depict Thailog later going to Castle Wyvern to persuade the clones to rejoin him, as they still had not developed free will at that time. After a battle with Goliath and his clan, most of the clones decide to return to the Labyrinth, at the insistence of Delilah. Only Brentwood decides to remain with Thailog.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\n* '''Malibu''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) - Malibu is the clone of Brooklyn. There are hints to a possible relationship between Malibu and Delilah (much to the disappointment of Brooklyn, before his initial meeting with his own future mate Katana).<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n* '''Brentwood''' (voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]]) - Brentwood is the clone of Lexington. Unlike the other clones, he decides to remain with Thailog, viewing him to be smart. He was the only clone, however, to stay out of the fight between the clans. Brentwood parallels with the evil Lexington from ''Future Tense''. (Lex comments on his decision, saying \"You're really making me look bad.\")<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n* '''Hollywood''' (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) - Hollywood is the clone of Broadway.\n* '''Burbank''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) - Burbank is the clone of Hudson. Much like Hudson, Burbank carries a weapon, in his case, a mace. and lacks the injured left eye Hudson still possesses.\n* '''Delilah''' (voiced by [[Salli Richardson]]) - Delilah is not an exact clone; she is a [[wiktionary:binary clone|binary clone]] of Demona and Elisa's DNA, programmed to be a servile concubine for Thailog, replacing Demona. Delilah is voiced by [[Salli Richardson]]. Goliath went to the Labyrinth requesting Delilah's company for a Halloween dance (as Elisa had broken up with him). After Thailog crashes the party, Delilah is given the choice to remain with Thailog or go back to The Labyrinth. After deciding to leave Thailog, she asked the other clones to make the same choice, and was joined by all of them except for Brentwood. Delilah was angry that Goliath tried to use her as a replacement for Elisa when they temporarily broke up. Goliath had explained to Elisa that he could never feel anything for Delilah, because Gargoyles mate for life.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n:In the unmade spinoff, ''Gargoyles 2198'', Delilah's eponymous descendant would have been a main character, close friends with Samson (the grandson of Broadway and Angela, resembling Goliath).<ref name=\"2198faq\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/faq.php?s=gargs2198\n| title = Gargoyles FAQ: Gargoyles 2198\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n* '\"Anton\"' also called Little Anton - Made by Sevarius using the DNA from all the gargoyles.\n\nThe clones differ from the originals by their colors, and some features like horns or teeth.  To gain a physical advantage, Malibu, Brentwood, Hollywood and Burbank were aged to be in their biological 20s: older than the young trio, yet younger than Hudson.\n\nThe clones' names are places in [[Los Angeles]], contrasting with and spoofing (as chosen by Demona) their counterpart protagonists' New York City placenames.\n\n===Thailog===\n'''Thailog''' (''Thailog'' is the reverse spelling of \"Goliath\") was a [[cloning|clone]] of Goliath created by Anton Sevarius and educated by David Xanatos, (via a \"[[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] [[education]] program\"), giving him many of Xanatos's [[personality]] traits. He would prove to be both a [[genius]] and a persistent enemy. Thailog debuts in season 2, in ''Double Jeopardy'', which aired in November 1995.  Like Goliath, he was also voiced by [[Keith David]]. A \"monster\", in Xanatos' words. Goliath's body and Xanatos' mind. \n\nDeciding that he would never be free under Xanatos' thumb, Thailog planned his own [[kidnapping]] by Sevarius, blackmails Xanatos for 20 million dollars for his safe return, and, after meeting his genetic source, Goliath, for the first time, seemingly perishes in an explosion.  Xanatos later guesses that Thailog had planned to fake his death all along, leaving him both free of Xanatos, and free to spend the 20 million without interference.  Xanatos realizes that he has created a monster, one as strong as Goliath, and as smart as, (if not smarter than), himself.\n\nUnder the name \"''Alexander Thailog''\", Thailog would later form a [[partnership]]/relationship with Demona, (business-wise they formed a company, called \"''Nightstone Unlimited''\"), but was planning to let her and Macbeth die, in order to inherit both their fortunes. (Demona, in her human form, planned to marry Macbeth and then claim that he was dead in order to inherit his fortune, Thailog planned to kill Macbeth and Demona and as her sole business partner, her Banker, he would inherit their combined fortunes).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/>  Both of them later commissioned Sevarius to create a clan of clones, which he eventually betrayed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/>\n\nThailog eventually \"dies\", (or, more accurately, lapses into a permanent stone sleep), in the third season of the animated series, but Thailog is depicted as alive in the canonical SLG Comic Book.\n\nThe dynamics between Thailog and Xanatos somewhat mirror that of [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[cloning|clone]] of [[Superman]] in ''Vatman'', in [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (season 1)|season one]] of [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]], which aired in March 1994.\n\n==Humans==\nIn addition to the gargoyles, human characters figure prominently in the series, both as allies and enemies of the gargoyles.\n\n===Residents of Castle Wyvern 954-994===\n\n====Princess Katharine====\n'''Princess Katarine''' is the leader of Castle Wyvern (and, by default, the Scottish clan of gargoyles) during the 990s. Katharine was at first prejudiced against the clan, but after they saved her life, she vowed to protect the clans' unhatched eggs<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and raise them on Avalon.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> She was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]].\n\n====Katherine's parents====\n;Prince Malcolm\n:'''Prince Malcolm''' was Katharine's father, the previous lord of Wyvern Castle, Hudson's good friend, and brother to [[Kenneth II of Scotland|King Kenneth]]. He formed a co-existence alliance with the gargoyles who had been there for centuries, and built Castle Wyvern. Goliath, Demona, and Hudson saved his life from an attack by the Archmage. He also inadvertently inspired hatred of gargoyles at Wyvern, particularly in Princess Katharine\u2014he told her that the gargoyles would get her if she didn't stay in bed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> He was apparently deceased by the time of the Viking attack in 994.  Voiced by [[Roger Rees]].\n;Princess Elena\n:'''Princess Elena''' is Katherine's mother.  She married Prince Malcolm in 975, and intended to give him the Phoenix Gate as a dowry (until it was stolen by Demona).  Voiced by Kath Soucie.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/>\n\n====The Magus====\n'''The Magus''' was a court magician of Castle Wyvern and Katharine's top advisor. It was the Magus who cast the spell that imprisoned Goliath's clan in stone, believing that the Viking Hakon had murdered the Princess and blaming the gargoyles for her death. He later discovered that Princess Katharine had been rescued by Goliath; unable to restore the gargoyles (as Hakon had burned the page with his counterspell), he agreed to place Goliath under the same spell, so that he might one day be reunited with his clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> The Magus guided Princess Katharine and the eggs to Avalon, and harbored unrequited feelings for the princess for many years. He died after using a great deal of energy to defeat the Weird Sisters.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n====Tom the Guardian====\nIn 10th-century Scotland, Tom was a peasant boy at Wyvern Castle, who was eager to make friends with the gargoyles, especially the future-named Lexington & Brooklyn, despite his mother's objections. He also accompanied Princess Katherine and the gargoyle eggs to Avalon, where he took on the role of Guardian, protecting the eggs & training the young gargoyles when they hatched. While living on Avalon, the adult Tom became Katharine's confidante, and eventually her husband.\n\n====Mary====\n'''Mary''', Tom the Guardian's mother, was fiercely anti-gargoyle like Katharine,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> but had a change of heart as she, too, vowed to protect the eggs. Along with Finnella, she did not go to Avalon, instead choosing to stay on Earth and guard the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'', stating that, \"a woman alone might run into trouble: two women can cause plenty of it\".<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> When a Timedancing Brooklyn arrived in Scotland in 997, Mary recognized him as one of the gargoyles from Goliath's clan.  Together, the three of them joined Constantine's enemies, led by King Kenneth III.  She and Finella would continue guarding the ''Grimorum'' while leaving 997 with Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>  In October 1996, Mary (or a woman resembling her) attended a Halloween party atop The Eyrie Building.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n\n====The Archmage====\n'''The Archmage''' was an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and an enemy of the gargoyle clan at Castle Wyvern. He was defeated by Goliath,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> but his future self saved him from his fall in a perpetual time paradox\u2014as his future self existed in the 1990s, and rescued his past self, without any explanation for how the loop began. The Archmage continues to live through this loop, despite his later defeat, after rescuing himself in the past.\n\nThe Archmage was encouraged to conquer the world, but first had to retrieve the trio of occult objects he most desired, the \"three keys to power\" in the series, comprising: the ancient book of magic spells named the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'', the Phoenix Gate and the Eye of Odin; as well as to conquer Avalon as a base of operations. His future self secured an alliance with the Weird Sisters to watch out for the mystical artifacts, as well as guide the destinies of Demona and Macbeth, advising them to bend Oberon's law of non-interference.\n\nThe \"Future Archmage\" brought his past self nearly a thousand years into the future, where his past self swallowed the ''Grimorum'' in order for the spellbook to be brought onto the island (\"human magic\" is not allowed on Avalon by law; consuming it created a \"legal loophole\"), thus making him very powerful. However, he was defeated by Goliath, who stripped him of the Eye of Odin, causing the ''Grimorum'' to turn the Archmage into a pile of dust.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/>  During some unspecified time, the enhanced Archmage undertook additional time travel, thus meeting a Timedancing Brooklyn.<ref name=\"greg archives 24\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/archives.php?lid=24\n| title = Ask Greg Archives: Timedancer\n| page = 24\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = December 17, 2009\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref> He was voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]].\n\n====The Captain of the Guard====\n'''The Captain of the Guard''' was the head of Castle Wyvern's [[garrison]] in 994. Resentful of the lack of appreciation that he and the gargoyles received for defending the castle, he struck a deal with Demona and the Vikings to have the castle [[Looting|sacked]], forcing out the humans and leaving only him and the gargoyles. The plan included sabotage, such as severing bowstrings, but backfired when the Viking leader Hakon shattered most of the gargoyles during the day after the siege, prompting Goliath and the survivors (Hudson, Brooklyn, Broadway, Lexington and Bronx) to go after the Vikings for revenge. The Captain was killed along with Hakon in 994, when they fell off a cliff,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> but their spirits remained trapped in the area as punishment for their actions. When Goliath returned to the Wyvern site a thousand years later, the Captain and Hakon, in spirit form, attempted to steal Goliath's [[Energy (esotericism)|lifeforce]] and thus free themselves from the area. He stopped midway, after realizing his guilt for his treachery, and instead turned on Hakon. Having atoned for his sins, his spirit was set free to rest in peace.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 37 Shadows of the Past\"/> Voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]].\n\n===Residents of New York===\n\n====Elisa Maza====\n'''[[Elisa Maza]]''' is a NYPD detective, friend of the Gargoyles,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and later love interest for Goliath.

He is eternally bound to Demona and is forced to live in conflict with her forever; neither one can die until one simultaneously kills the other.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Initially an enemy of the gargoyles, he later becomes their ally. He tried to claim the sword Excalibur for himself but did not succeed in doing this. After being impressed with Macbeth's skills and honorable behavior King Arthur offered him a place in the New Round Table. Macbeth, while honored, refused this offer because he felt he could not submit to Arthur's rule as he was a [[self-made man]]. But, Macbeth offered his services should there ever be a crisis. He sometimes uses the alias Lennox Macduff (after two characters in the Shakespeare play). He was voiced by [[John Rhys-Davies]].\n\n=====Macbeth's family=====\n;[[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]]\n:'''Duncan''' was the ancient king of Scotland, Macbeth's foe, and the second to wear the Hunter mask. He secretly ordered the death of Macbeth's father, and destroyed the few remaining gargoyles in Scotland. It was because of Duncan that the Weird Sisters forged the spell between Macbeth and Demona.

Canmore is banished to England, but returns to Scotland as a grown man for revenge. Like his father before him, Canmore takes up the mask of the Hunter and declares war upon the gargoyles.

He was killed, along with the Captain of the Guard, when they fell off a cliff, but their spirits remained trapped in the area as punishment for their actions.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> When Goliath returned to the Wyvern site a thousand years later, the Captain and Hakon, in spirit form, attempted to steal Goliath's [[Energy (esotericism)|lifeforce]] to free themselves from the area. Hakon's spirit reappeared throughout the series, trying to take revenge on Goliath.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 37 Shadows of the Past\"/> Before his death, Hakon apparently fathered children who became the ancestors of Pack member Wolf. His spirit later bonded to his ax. After the ax was destroyed by Hudson, his spirit dissolved.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 59 Vendettas\"/> He was voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].\n\n===Finella===\n'''Finella''' is a Scottish princess from 995. Finella was conned into helping Constantine set a deadly trap for King Kenneth upon Constantine's promise to marry her. Less than pleased at his betrayal and engagement to another, Finella helped Princess Katharine and the Magus get the eggs to Avalon and escape from Constantine, who wanted to marry Princess Katherine in order to secure his claim to the throne and destroy the eggs.  Finella did not follow Katharine and company onto Avalon, instead choosing to guard the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'' with help from Tom's mother Mary.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/>\n\nIn 997, while Timedancing, Brooklyn arrived to save Finella and Mary from one of Constantine's soldiers.  Together, the three of them joined Constantine's enemies, led by King Kenneth III.  The book was taken from Finella, during the fight, by Constantine's sorcerer, Brother Valmont.  After it was retrieved by Brookyln, Finella and Mary continued guarding the ''Grimorum'', leaving 997 with Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nIn October 1996, Finella (or a woman resembling her) attended a [[Halloween]] party atop The Eyrie Building.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\nShe was loosely based on the real historical character [[Finnguala]], and was voiced by [[Sheena Easton]].\n\n===Arthur Pendragon===\n'''Arthur Pendragon''' was once the legendary and Future King of Britain. Pendragon was based on the legend of [[King Arthur]]. He was awakened by Elisa to help fight the Archmage in Avalon. Though he had neither [[Merlin]] nor his knights nor the famed sword [[Excalibur]], he fought Macbeth and won. He then decided to explore the modern world on his own,  so as not draw attention to himself.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> Arriving in England, he was joined by the English gargoyle Griff, and battled Macbeth\u2014with the help of the Manhattan Clan\u2014to reclaim Excalibur. After defeating Macbeth and reclaiming Excalibur, he set off along with Griff on a journey to find Merlin.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 48 Pendragon\"/>\n\n===The Hunters/Quarrymen===\nDescendants of King [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]], the '''Hunters''' are fighters from a series of [[Legacy hero#Legacy villain|hereditary villains through time]] that have sworn under the Hunter Mask to hunt down [[Demona]] and destroy all gargoyles. The current generation (consisting of Jason, Jon, and Robyn) come to New York after hearing of gargoyle encounters.  However, Jason and Robyn Canmore eventually come to realize that not all gargoyles are the threat to humanity that Demona is, and drop the Hunter cause.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 63-65 Hunter's Moon, Part 1-3\"/> Their brother Jon, initially apprehensive, develops a deep hatred for the gargoyles, drops the Hunter persona, and changes his name to John Castaway. As Castaway, he leads an anti-gargoyle group reminiscent of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] called the '''Quarrymen'''.\n\nJason was recovering in the hospital<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> while Robyn was recruited into ''The Redemption Squad'' to lead it.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\nThe three modern Hunters are Jason (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]), Jon (voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]]), and (formerly) Robyn Canmore (voiced by [[Sheena Easton]]).\n\n====Banquo and Fleance====\n'''Banquo''' (a man) and '''Fleance''' (a woman) are two mercenaries who worked for Macbeth. They helped him retrieve the first Scrolls of Merlin<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 17 A Lighthouse in the Sea of Time\"/> and the sword Excalibur.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 48 Pendragon\"/>  They later left his service to work for the Quarrymen.  Their first mission as Quarrymen had them, and Castaway, pursuing Goliath and Elisa to the destroyed Clocktower.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> Banquo and Fleance are named after the characters [[Banquo]] and [[Fleance]] in Shakespeare's play ''[[Macbeth|The Tragedy of Macbeth]]''.\n\n===Minor human characters===\n;[[Cuchulainn]]\n:The legendary demi-god hero of Ireland, '''Cuchulainn''' is encountered by Goliath and his allies reincarnated as an Irish teenager named Rory Dugan. He reverts to his heroic form when Rory's own girlfriend Molly reveals herself to be his old enemy, the Banshee, in disguise, especially when she further transforms herself into [[Irish mythology in popular culture#Crom Cruach|the gigantic, centipede-like \"death worm\" ''Cromm-Cruach'']]. For a time, Cuchulainn mistakes Bronx for the legendary [[Hound of Ulster]].  He was voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]].\n;Nick (Natsilane)\n:A Native American youth of the Pacific Northwest, '''Nick''' (born '''[[Natsilane]]''', presumably named for or descended from the legendary hero) initially rejects his heritage for the realities of the modern world. He later encounters Goliath, Angela, and Bronx, and comes to accept the existence of the supernatural. He takes up the cause of his tribe and does battle with the trickster spirit Raven.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 38 Heritage\"/> He was voiced by [[Gregg Rainwater]].\n;Max Loew\n:A direct descendant of [[Rabbi Loew]], '''Max''' reanimates the powerful [[Golem]] to protect the people of [[Prague]]. When the Golem is insincerely hijacked by '''Halcyon Reynard''' as a replacement for his frail body, Max enlists the help of '''Goliath''', '''Angela''' and '''Elisa''' to recover it. Though it is never explicitly stated in the episode, Max and the people the Golem was created to protect are implicitly [[Jewish]]. It is not stated whether Max is a citizen of the [[Czech Republic]] or an American visiting Prague. Max was voiced by [[Scott Weil]].\n;The [[Emir]]\n:Mentioned by name in two episodes, but not seen in person until the episode ''Grief'', the '''Emir''' was an Egyptian dignitary hired by Xanatos to capture [[#Minor Children of Oberon|Anubis]], in yet another attempt to obtain immortality. However, the Emir planned on using Anubis to resurrect his dead son, who he felt was unfairly taken away from him in a \"pointless car accident\". Jackal hijacked the ceremony, but the Emir was able to usurp Anubis's power back. As the avatar of death, the Emir finally realized the role death plays in the world and that it cannot be meddled with, as much has humans want to. He reversed everything Jackal had done as the avatar, and sacrificed himself to free Anubis. He was voiced by [[Tony Shalhoub]].\n;Travis Marshall\n:'''Travis Marshall''' is a television anchor reporter at WVRN who also hosts the TV program ''Nightwatch''. He is voiced by [[Charles Hallahan]].\n;Maria Chavez\n:'''Maria Chavez''' was the Captain of NYPD's 23rd precinct and Elisa Maza's superior.

After causing Goliath and Elisa problems in Prague, he moves to New York to take on Tony Dracon. Voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].\n;Taro\n:'''Taro''' is a Japanese businessman who threatened to expose the Ishimura Clan to the world through a \"gargoyle theme park\" he had constructed for the task on the outskirts of Ishimura; this \"theme park\" also functioned as a prison-like facility for any gargates within it for the purposes of public display, which ran against the Ishimura Clan's wishes (their Clan already had a long-established, strongly positive relationship with Ishimura's human population). As a result, Yama took on Taro and defeated him in one-on-one combat. Voiced by [[James Saito]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 53 Bushido\"/> \n;Shaman\n:An [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigine]] wise man, who became Dingo's spiritual advisor when the latter decided to wipe the slate clean regarding his past.  He was aware of Dingo's armor, and of the existence of Gargoyles. He also helped Dingo and Goliath reach the [[Dreamtime]] to communicate and reason with Matrix.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 46 Walkabout\"/>  He also suggested that both Dingo and Matrix should join The Redemption Squad.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>  He was voiced by [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]].\n\n==The Third Race/Oberon's Children==\nThe '''Third Race''', also known as '''Oberon's Children''', were magical, shapeshifting, and often fickle creatures and fairies from around the world. They were not all literally descended from Oberon, but he was their leader and he governed all of the Third Race under a strictly-enforced set of rules. They possessed incredible powers, were apparently immortal, but had a fatal weakness to any form of iron in proximity to them. Regardless, as long as they were in the real world, Oberon forbade them from interfering in human events. However, many of the Third Race (particularly the Weird Sisters), as well as humans and gargoyles, have realized that Oberon's laws can be bent even if they cannot be broken.\n\n===Oberon===\n'''[[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]''' was the lord of Avalon. He possessed [[god]]like powers and was the most powerful being in the whole series. Very arrogant and impudent, it was by his edict that Avalon was abandoned and the Third Race forced to live with humanity, partially due to Titania's habit of interfering directly in mortal affairs. Oberon later himself left Avalon to join them. He was also responsible for ''The Gathering,'' in which the Third Race left the rest of the world and congregated in Avalon.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> He was voiced by [[Terrence Mann]].\n\n===Titania===\n'''[[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]]''' was Oberon's (recently remarried) wife and Queen of Avalon. Posing as the human Anastasia during part of her 1,000-year exile, she was the ex-wife of Halcyon Renard, and Fox's biological mother. A highly skilled manipulator, she aided the [[Manhattan Clan|Manhattan]]<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> and [[Avalon Clan]]s on several occasions, frequently keeping Oberon in check and teaching him some humility. She was voiced by [[Kate Mulgrew]].\n\n===The Weird Sisters===\n'''[[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]]''' &ndash; '''Phoebe''', '''Selene''', and '''Luna''' &ndash; were a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of powerful magic users named after three [[Greco-Roman]] goddesses of the [[Moon]] and based on the witches from Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]''. The sisters appeared sporadically throughout early episodes in various guises, but eventually revealed their hand in looking after Demona and Macbeth, being the ones who linked their fates and made them immortal.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Their overarching motivation, however, is to aid the Archmage in gaining revenge upon Katherine, Tom, and the Magus,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> who had outwitted them and gained entry to Avalon in spite of Oberon's ban. Following the Archmage's defeat, the Weird Sisters generally stopped stirring up trouble and were content to serve Oberon again following his return. They were last seen forcibly bringing the Banshee before Oberon at the Gathering.\n\nThe blond-haired sister is named [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], who embodies [[Divine grace|grace]]. The black-haired sister is named [[Selene]], who embodies [[Revenge|vengeance]]. And the silver-haired one is named [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and who embodies [[fate]]; all three are named for moon goddesses of classical mythology. All three sisters were voiced by [[Kath Soucie]].\n\n===Puck/Owen===\n'''[[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]''' was a trickster fairy. His magic was the reason why [[Demona]] became human during the day, instead of turning to stone.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 18 The Mirror\"/> It was eventually discovered that he was Owen Burnett, having made a deal with [[David Xanatos|Xanatos]] to serve him faithfully. Because of this deal and his affinity for humans, he was banished from Avalon and had the use of his powers \"hard-limited\" by Oberon. Since the Gathering, Puck could only use his powers within Oberon's strictly imposed limits: meaning they were only usable when Puck was teaching or protecting his employer's son, Alexander Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> In the third season, this was shown to be a drawback; Owen was rendered unconscious when Alexander was kidnapped by the Quarrymen, leaving Puck unable to save the boy. He was voiced by [[Brent Spiner]].\n\n===Minor children of Oberon===\nThe rest of the Children of Oberon were [[fairies]], [[Deity|gods]], and other various creatures from cultures and mythologies worldwide that lived in [[Places in Disney's Gargoyles|Avalon]] until they were all expelled by Oberon. They were forcibly called back to Avalon by him one thousand years later in an event known as ''The Gathering''.\n\n;[[Anansi]]\n:'''Anansi''' is a spider trickster of African myth. He can literally spin spells using his web, which is also his weakness; if his web is taken apart, Anansi is powerless. His magic can change the shape of living creatures.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 47 Mark of the Panther\"/> Voiced by [[LeVar Burton]]\n;[[Anubis]]\n:'''Anubis''' is the ancient Egyptian Jackal Lord and avatar of death. Those who became his avatar and used his powers could reduce or advance the ages of others, but few were worthy enough to wield it. Voiced by [[Tony Jay]]\n;[[Banshee]]\n:'''Banshee''' is an Irish fairy with a powerful wailing scream, and the modern archenemy of [[Irish mythology in popular culture#C\u00fa Chulainn|Cu Chulainn]]. Goliath, Eliza and Angela encountered her on their adventure to Ireland.  She objected to The Gathering and was forcibly brought to Avalon by the Weird Sisters before being attacked by Odin for her insolence. Oberon silences Banshee by sealing her mouth.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> - Voiced by [[Sheena Easton]]\n;[[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]]\n:'''Coyote''' is a Native American trickster spirit. He primarily appeared as the younger self of Elisa's father, though he can also take the form of a [[whirlwind]]. Xanatos captured him with his latest coyote robot in an attempt to force Coyote to grant him and Fox (and by extension, their then-unborn son Alex) immortality.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 54 Cloud Fathers\"/>\n;[[Grandmother]]\n:'''Grandmother''' is an elderly wisewoman of great power. Raven has said they are cousins. After Raven is defeated (again, ritually), Grandmother revitalizes the island with magical water formed from her hair.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 38 Heritage\"/>\n;The [[Lady of the Lake]]\n:'''The Lady of the Lake''' is the patron of King Arthur and keeper of Excalibur during his time of absence. (Although several Ladies appear in Arthurian myth, it is unclear which, if any, the ''Gargoyles'' character is intended to be.)<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 48 Pendragon\"/>\n;[[Odin]]\n:'''Odin''' is the All-Father of Norse mythology. The Eye of Odin, a magical item that featured prominently in the series, is his actual eye as known of in Norse lengend, preserved as a jewel-like magical artifact on Avalon in the distant past, and amicably returned to him by Goliath in the \"Avalon World Tour\" story arc's episode entitled ''Eye of the Storm''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/archives.php?lid=91 |title=Gargoyles - Ask Greg Archives - Odin - \" This day in Gargoyles' Universe History...May 21st...1996\" |last=Weisman |first=Greg |date=May 21, 2007 |website=s8.org |publisher=Station Eight |access-date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Goliath challenges Odin, and the two \"gods\" do battle.

Originally meant to replace the gargoyles, Xanatos used them for his own personal army.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> He also wore a battle suit modeled in their likeness.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 10 The Edge\"/>  An iron version of the Steel Clan was made to fight against Oberon.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/>  Xanatos later used an Iron and Steel Clan robot to aid Coldsteel and Coyote 5.0 in retrieving the Stone of Destiny.\n\n===The New Olympians===\n'''The New Olympians''' were a group of fantastical sentient beings resembling creatures and gods from [[Greek Mythology]]. They had traveled to the island of New Olympus after being driven there by fearful humans in [[Classical Antiquity]], and their descendants were able to remain hidden through advanced cloaking technology. Several of them shared names with characters from mythology, although they were not intended to be identified with those characters, unlike some [[children of Oberon]]. According to Gargoyles creator Greg Weisman, they are descended from Oberon's children, though the show makes no mention of this, and there is also a resident gargoyle clan on the island.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nThey were led by a winged man named [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] (voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]), and their Chief of Security was a [[Minotaur]] named Taurus (voiced by [[Michael Dorn]]). A robot named [[Talos]]\u2014an upgraded version of the Talos first constructed by [[Daedalus]] and also voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]\u2014is a high-level advisor. A villainous shapeshifter named [[Proteus]] (voiced by [[Roddy McDowall]]) seemed to be the island's worst criminal. Other named members of the race included [[Helios]] (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]), [[Echidna (mythology)|Ekidna]] (voiced by Charity James), and [[Chiron|Kiron]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). In the last two instances, the use of the letter \"k\" in the spelling was intended by the show's creators to differentiate the characters from their mythological namesakes.\n\nThe New Olympians appeared during the \"Avalon World Tour\" story arc in the episode ''The New Olympians'', in which [[Elisa Maza]] arrived on the island along with her three \"gargoyle\" companions (Goliath, his daughter Angela, and Bronx). Because of their experiences with the human race\u2014Taurus at one point specifically mentions the murder of his ancestor by [[Theseus]]\u2014the New Olympians harbored a strong hatred against Elisa and humans in general. This inverts the show's usual premise, in which many humans are prejudiced against creatures such as gargoyles. After an encounter with Proteus, Elisa managed to convince some New Olympians\u2014particularly Taurus\u2014that not all humans are evil.\n\nA spinoff show, itself entitled ''The New Olympians'', was planned; the ''Gargoyles'' episode featuring the characters was a \"[[backdoor pilot]]\". A series [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] was produced, revealing that the new series' storyline would have revolved around the New Olympians revealing themselves to humanity in front of the United Nations. The pitch, which is shown at [[The Gathering (Gargoyles)|Gathering conventions]], introduced several new characters and hinted at a [[Romeo and Juliet]]-style romance between Sphinx (a New Olympian female) and Terry Chung (a human male). Although the series was never picked up, Greg Weisman has said that elements would have been included in the main ''Gargoyles'' series had it continued.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Terry Chung appears as a trick or treater in the ''Gargoyles'' comic issue number four, which places the beginning of ''New Olympians'' at least a decade after the 2006 issues.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  He appears with during New Year's Eve of 1996 with his first cousin Tri Chung.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/><ref name=\"greg 10963\"/>\n\nProteus escapes to New York to exact his revenge. Taurus leaves New Olympus to pursue him.  This is not considered canon by Weisman.<ref name=\"Goliath Chron 12\"/>\n\n===Nokkar===\n'''Nokkar''' was a [[Border guard|sentinel]] and member of the [[N'Kai]] (interstellar [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] who oppose the [[Space-Spawn]] empire), Nokkar waited on [[Easter Island]] to protect the [[Earth]]. While there, he was revered as a [[god]] by the [[natives]], and the [[Moai|Easter Island Statues]] were modeled after him. He once captured Goliath and Angela, believing them to be [[Space-Spawn]] in disguise. Until the quartet of the \"Avalon World Tour\" visit Easter Island, Nokkar does not yet know of the Earth's gargoyle population, and is resultingly confused, thinking that they are with the aliens he is guarding against. In addition, Nokkar has never had any contact with any of the residents of Avalon, the children of Oberon, or any of the New Olympians. He was voiced by [[Avery Brooks]].\n\n===Tazmanian Tiger===\n'''Tazmanian Tiger''' was a supervillain who robbed a bank in [[Sydney]].  His actions caught the attention of Dingo and Matrix (both of whom were Australia's crimefighters). He wore a skin tight costume and mask. His gloves had a set of razor sharp claws that were able to damage Matrix. He was assisted by two [[thylacine]]s named Benjamin and Natasha.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n==Organizations and groups==\n\n===The Illuminati===\nIn the ''Gargoyles'' universe, '''[[Illuminati|The Illuminati]]''' were a secret society started by [[Sir Percival]], the [[Fisher King]], that controlled and manipulated a large portion of the world, including politics and organized crime. Xanatos was a member of the Illuminati, which aided him in making his fortune (through a predestination paradox\u2014Xanatos had instructed himself to travel through time).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/> Bluestone was inducted into the society after gangster Mace Malone's failed attempt to capture Goliath.  Matt's former partner in the FBI, Martin Hacker, was also a member of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/> Thailog joined as a new member at some unspecified time, and was the first gargoyle known to be part of the Society.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  The Society was last seen headed by Peredur fab Ragnal.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nEach member was of a certain numerical rank. When two members of the society encountered each other in private, they would share their rank.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\n====Peredur fab Ragnal====\n'''Peredur fab Ragnal''' is introduced in the trade paperback for the comic, as the story introducing him was not published as a single issue.  He was the leader of The Illuminati, and, through Quincy Hemmings, ordered Xanatos to steal The Stone of Destiny while it was being returned to Scotland.  To his disappointment, there were 3 stones which the Spirit of Destiny inhabited, but from it he learned that Arthur had reawakened.  Since Arthur was not supposed to awaken for another 200 years, Peredur decides to hold a meeting of the higher-echelon members, since this development could affect their (unspecified) plans.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Ragnal does not appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Jude Law]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\"/>\n\n====Fleur====\n'''Fleur''', originally known as \"Blanchefleur\", is introduced in the trade paperback edition of the comic, as the story introducing her was not published as a single issue.  She is Peredur's wife, and met Xanatos in a warehouse after he apparently stole the Stone of Destiny.  She discovered that Arthur Pendragon awakened after eavesdropping on a message that the Stone conveyed to Peredur.  Like Duval, Fleur was also important to Peredur, but Fleur has had an occasionally contentious relationship with Duval,<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> and envisioned actress [[Rhona Mitra]] to voice the character for potential animation.\n\n====Matt Bluestone====\n'''Matt Bluestone''' is a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] and a [[Detective Sergeant]] in the [[NYPD]].  He was a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who was assigned to be Elisa's partner after the shooting incident.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 8 Deadly Force\"/> The NYPD 23rd [[police precinct|Precinct]]'s Captain, Maria Chavez, thought it was too dangerous for Elisa to be working on her own after she was shot, and assigned Bluestone as her new partner so that she would have someone covering her back\u2014despite Elisa's adamant protests that she did not need a partner. Bluestone is a big believer in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], especially the [[Illuminati]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 10 The Edge\"/>  He was one of the few humans who were friends with the Manhattan Clan. The Illuminati were impressed enough with Matt persistence that they made him a member; ironically, this works in his favor in trying to expose them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/> He was voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]].\n\n====Martin Hacker====\n'''Martin Hacker''' was Matt Bluestone's former partner in the FBI<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 19 The Silver Falcon\"/> and an Illuminati operative, Hacker's job was to intentionally mislead Matt away from the Illuminati. When this failed, it was Martin who conferred membership onto Matt on the behalf of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/>\n\nAfter Manhattan discovers the existence of gargoyles, Hacker checks in on Matt Bluestone and John Castaway, as well as giving Xanatos an invitation to the White House from the Illuminati.  While meeting all three of them, he claims a different objective from The Illuminati. With Matt Bluestone, he claims that the Illuminati agree that people aren't ready to encounter gargoyles. With Xanatos, he says the Illuminati feel it is time for humans and gargoyles to meet. As for John Castaway, he claimed that the Illuminati agree that the gargoyles should be destroyed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  He was voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]].\n\n====Norman Ambassador====\nThe unnamed '''Norman Ambassador''' escorted Princess Elena to Castle Wyvern in 975.  Both were attacked by the Archmage's bandits and rescued by Xanatos (who followed Demona into the past).  Out of gratitude, and due to being a fellow Illuminatus, he allowed Xanatos and his family to join them at Wyvern.  He also took a couple of envelopes with him at Xanatos' request\u2014one containing a rare coin to give to a younger David Xanatos in 1975; the other containing details on how the coin was obtained, thus inspiring himself to travel back in time.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/>\n\n====Mace Malone====\n'''Mace Malone''' was a leading gangster in the 1920s who was recruited into the Illuminati because of his underworld dealings.  In 1924, the crime syndicates became aware of their vulnerability to the Illuminati, resulting in Mace having to disappear.  He had a long life due to rejuvenation drugs.  His habit of visiting Flo Dane alerted Matt Bluestone to his presence, who saw a photo with Mace wearing a society emblem and received confirmation of his suspicions from Mace's stepson Jack.  As a result, Matt was offered membership if he brought a gargoyle to the abandoned Hotel Cabal, an Illuminati base.  Though Matt brought Goliath, he secretly filled Goliath in on Mace's plan and left a hotel key for Goliath to escape.  Mace, however, lost his key in the confusion and became trapped in the hotel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/>\n\n====Mr. Duval====\n'''Mr. Duval''' is first mentioned in the ''Gargoyle: The Goliath Chronicles'' episode \"The Journey\" (adapted into the first two issues of the SLG comic series).  Duval tried to call Xanatos, but Xanatos shows no interest in receiving the call.  Hacker tells Xanatos that the call was an invitation to the White House for an Illuminati assignment.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\nFor unspecified reasons, Duval's left eye and arm are replaced with cybernetic attachments, and he has an unexplained disdain for Blanchefleur.  He is also very important to Peredur.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Duval does not appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Eddie Marsan]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=11829\n| page = 11829\n| title = Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles!\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = August 24, 2009\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Shari====\n'''Shari''' is a teenage girl introduced in the ''[[Gargoyles (SLG comic)]]'' comics series.  She appeared as a new resident of The Labyrinth, and was introduced to the Mutates and Clones.  After Thailog came to reclaim the clones, Shari left to warn Goliath, but was lying.  Her name was revealed as she arrived at Nightstone Unlimited, applying to be Thailog's executive assistant. Before Thailog attacked her, however, he spotted an Illuminati pendant around her neck and welcomed her as a member of the Illuminati\u2014which he had recently joined as a lower-echelon member.\n\nThailog soon demanded a story from Shari, and so she told him of a lost tale from The Avalon World Tour.  How she learned of that adventure was not specified.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\nShari went on to relate the legend of the Stone of Destiny to Thailog. She appeared to be more than she seemed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\n====Quincy Hemings====\n'''Quincy Hemings''' made his first appearance in the SLG comic. He is a Chief Steward at the [[White House]].  Xanatos meets him at the White House, and mistakes him for Duval due to their shared rank number.  Hemings mentioned being on staff since the administration of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and being in his current position since the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration.  He gave Xanatos an assignment from The Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> The assignment required Xanatos to retrieve the Stone Of Destiny.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Hemings doesn't appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Morgan Freeman]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\" />\n\n====Falstaff====\n'''Falstaff''' (went by the name '''John Oldcastle''') was a father figure to Dingo, but for reasons unknown, strangled Dingo's mother.  Upon the arrival of The Redemption Squad at his island base (which is really a ship), Falstaff insisted that The Illuminati are the good guys, determined to save the world, and allowed The Redemption Squad to speak to Fiona Canmore and Thailog, so they can vouch for the Illuminati.  The Redemption Squad claimed to want membership, but Falstaff was aware of their bluff and sent his associates to fight the Squad.  After the fight, he departed, but not before sinking the ship.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n=====Falstaff's associates=====\n;Bardolf\n:Breathes fire.\n;Pistol\n:Gun fighter.\n;Points\n:Swordsman.\n;Mistress Doll\n:Contortionist.\n;Mistress Quickly\n:She is the only one apprehended by The Redemption Squad.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n====Fiona Canmore====\n'''Fiona Canmore''' is a former Hunter who ran into Demona in Paris in 1920.  She stopped her plans to kill all the humans with the aid of Team Atlantis.<ref name=\"Team Atlantis - The Last\"/>  As of 1996, she was retired from the hunt and was part of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>  In the ''Team Atlantis'' episode (which, while unproduced, was scripted and voice-recorded), she was voiced by Sheena Easton.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=188\n| title = Search Ask Greg: Gathering 2002 Ramble: Saturday\n| date = July 10, 2002\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Known members and ranking====\nThe following characters are part of the Illuminati at the following ranks:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The company was seemingly at the forefront of advanced technology such as genetics, robotics, and weaponry. Xanatos Enterprises also included Gen-U-Tech, Pack Media Studios, and the Scarab Robotics corporation, all of which Xanatos used against the gargoyles and to further his goals one way or another.\n\n====David Xanatos====\n{{Main|David Xanatos}}\n'''David Xanatos''' is a billionaire, nemesis, and later ally of the gargoyles, Xanatos' name is reminiscent of [[David]]\u2014the Biblical king who defeated Goliath\u2014and [[Thanatos]] from Greek mythology. He broke the spell that imprisoned the gargoyles, and frequently attempted to manipulate or control them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> He was voiced by [[Jonathan Frakes]].\n\n====Owen Burnett====\n'''Owen Burnett''' was Xanatos' aide who is later revealed to be the immortal trickster [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]. Puck took on an appearance similar to that of Preston Vogel, Halcyon Renard's personal aid; he decides to \"out-Vogel Vogel\".<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> When Xanatos deduced his identity, Puck offered him the choice of receiving either the immortality he craved or a lifetime of Puck's service as Owen; to Puck's surprise, Xanatos chose the latter, confident that he would obtain immortality through other means and thus have Owen's services for eternity. For his part, Puck kept to the bargain in part for the novelty of assisting such an unorthodox mortal trickster; as he explained, \"\"The Puck has played many roles, but never that of [[straight man]].\"  The Owen persona eventually got his left hand turned to stone (the result of a spell gone wrong), and per Oberon's order, lost his magic powers except when he was training or protecting Alexander Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n====Anton Sevarius====\n'''Anton Sevarius''' was a [[free agent]] [[geneticist]] who mostly worked for the villains of the series, from David Xanatos to Demona. Known for his hammy play on the \"[[mad scientist]]\" stereotype, Sevarius was brilliant, but also devious and immoral. His experiments led to the creation of the [[Mutate (Gargoyles)|Mutates]]<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> and Goliath's evil clone [[Thailog]] (whom he also worked for at one point), as well as Thailog's gargoyle clones. He also helped Demona create a virus capable of destroying all human life on Earth (how he hoped to survive her plan is unknown, although he probably had anti-virus prepared for himself). In his final appearance, Sevarius used the DNA of all the Manhattan clan to create a giant gargoyle named Little Anton in order to destroy Goliath and his friends; however, it ended up petrified by the virus just like the Clone clan was suffering from. Little Anton's \"death\" was the only time Sevarius showed any concern for someone. He was voiced by [[Tim Curry]].<ref>{{Cite news\n| url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1927272,00.html\n| title = The Guardian profile: Tim Curry\n| accessdate= 2008-03-26\n| first = Mark\n| last = Brown\n| date = 2006-10-20\n| newspaper = The Guardian\n| publisher = Guardian News and Media\n| quote = And to understand why he has done dozens of cartoon voices (he is Dr Doom in Fantastic Four and Dr Anton Sevarius in Gargoyles) you need to travel to the city he adopted as home in the 80s, Los Angeles.}}</ref>\n\n===Cyberbiotics Corporation===\n'''Cyberbiotics Corporation''' was a rival in all ways to Xanatos Enterprises, led by Halcyon Renard and Preston Vogel. Xanatos attempted several times to bankrupt Cyberbiotics, even using Renard's estranged daughter Fox to do so.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> Cyberbiotics was based both from a skyscraper on a fictional island in New York Harbor known as the \"Cyberbiotics Tower\", and from either of two successive, massive, somewhat [[helicarrier]]-like [[airship]]s named the \"Fortress\", sometimes accompanied by or supplanted with (for smaller missions) any one of a number of smaller \"hoverships\". The first of these massive \"Fortress\" airships was inadvertently destroyed by the Manhattan Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/>\n\n====Halcyon Renard====\n'''Halcyon Renard''' was an elderly businessman who is [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Cyberbiotics, father of Fox, ex-husband to Anastasia, and rival to David Xanatos. He is confined to a powered reclining version of a wheelchair for unknown reasons; the chair is weaponized for his self-defense needs, along with other devices. After confronting Goliath about his role in destroying his first airship, he formed a friendship with the Manhattan Clan's leader after the pair worked together to save the second airship. It's suggested in \"The Cage\", that Halcyon lent a lab to Goliath so Dr. Sevarius could create a cure for the Labyrinth Clan. Halcyon's family name, ''renard'', is the French word for fox. Like Xanatos, he briefly flirted with immortality \u2014 with Renard's method being different, as he intended to transfer his own consciousness into a [[Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague|golem]], the legendary protector of the Ashkenazim living in [[Prague]] during Renaissance times, and still in existence in the late 20th century within the ''Gargoyles'' storyline. This form of what turned out to be a selfishly-acquired form of \"immortality\" did not go well for Renard, until Goliath managed to change Halcyon's mind for the better, convincing him to leave the Golem's lithic body behind. Unlike Xanatos, Halcyon was more conscientious of his actions, adhering strongly to his own well-developed ideals of personal [[integrity]] and near-complete [[sincerity]] for both himself, his firm's employees and others he had contact with. Indeed, one of the things that help the elderly man and the Manhattan Clan's leader bond and become friends is that Renard challenged Goliath to accept responsibility for his part in destroying the first airship. Goliath apparently grew to respect the older man because of his strong adherence to his own morals. It is worth noting that Renard and his assistant, Preston Vogel participated in a desperate attempt to stop Oberon from abducting his grandson, Alexander and taking the child to Avalon. When Vogel gently challenged his employer as to his reasons; noting that Renard hated his son in law and didn't trust his own daughter due to her lack of morals; Renard answered frankly, that he was doing it for his grandson and no one else. He was far less Machiavellian and malevolent than Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> He was voiced by [[Robert Culp]].\n\n====Preston Vogel====\n'''Preston Vogel''' was Renard's aide who was considered by Puck to be the most \"wooden man on the earth.\" Puck modeled his mortal form after Vogel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> Unlike Owen Burnett, Vogel was not as loyal to his boss, and had fewer scruples when it came to the means he used to get things done, such as hiring members of The Pack, Jackal, and Hyena; levelling a rainforest and killing a sizable number of the Guatemala Clan's gargoyles in 1993;<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 51 The Green\"/> or betraying Renard.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> Voiced by [[Peter Scolari]].\n\n===Gargoyles Task Force===\nThe '''Gargoyles Task Force''' was formed during Part 3 of ''Hunter's Moon'' to find and counter or capture the gargoyles.  They followed the gargoyles to St. Damien's Cathedral.  Due to Matt's surreptitious stalling, in hopes the clan could escape, they were unable to apprehend the clan.  Issue three of the comic introduced the Task Force.\n\n====Members====\n{{Div col}}\n* Agent Martin Hacker (F.B.I.

During Halloween of 1996, he asked Elisa out to the Halloween party atop The Eyrie Building.  Though she refused at first, she accepted after temporarily breaking up with Goliath (due to wanting a normal life). She ended up choosing Goliath, however.

She deduced Demona's human identity, and shot The Clocktower hoping to kill Goliath and Clan.  Though she saw the light after Jason's atonement,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 63-65 Hunter's Moon, Part 1-3\"/> Robyn was maintaining her identity as '''The Hunter''' while serving The Director.  The nature of her recruitment has yet to be revealed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/> She was voiced by Sheena Easton.\n\n====Dingo====\n'''Dingo''' (real name '''Harry Monmouth''') <ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/> was a former member of The Pack, Dingo remained with the team after Fox's departure but \u2014unlike Wolf, Jackal, and Hyena\u2014<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 14 Leader of the Pack\"/> refused to undergo physical enhancements, instead adopting a battle suit. He grew increasingly disturbed by his teammates' transformation after their supposed \"upgrade,\" feeling that they had abandoned their humanity and become \"a freak show\".<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 30 Upgrade\"/> He eventually left the team in disgust, returning to his native Australia and hoping to atone for his misdeeds.  He later linked with an advanced artificial-intelligence program, named ''Matrix'' to enhance his battle armor in order to become a crimefighter.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 46 Walkabout\"/>\n\nHe reluctantly joined The Squad, since it was the only way he could be cleared of  criminal charges in the United States.  He tended to bicker with Hunter.  He prevented an angered Yama from killing Fang.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>  Voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].\n\n====The Matrix====\n'''The Matrix''' was a [[nanomachine]] program created by Fox and her mother Anastasia Reynard as part of a world domination bid by Xanatos. However, the machines became sentient and threatened to overrun the planet (an allusion to the so-called [[grey goo]] scenario in speculative science fiction). With the help of a local [[shaman]], Goliath and Dingo convinced the nanomachines to form a humanoid shape that merged with Dingo's armor suit. Calling itself \"The Matrix\", the merged entity pledged to protect and defend Australia.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 46 Walkabout\"/>  He was coerced into joining The Squad as an alternative to deactivation;  he chose to join as doing so would help to maintain law and order.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/> Voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]\n\nSeries creator Greg Weisman had major plans for The Matrix; it was to have grown strong enough to power the planet.<ref name=\"2198faq\"/>\n\n====Yama====\n(Lit. \"The [[Mountain]]\")  Former member of the Ishimura Clan,  '''Yama''' briefly aided the businessman Taro in making the existence of his clan public (albeit for peaceful intentions).  Though he fought against Taro after learning his true motive, Yama was banished from the clan until he-himself feels that he has regained his lost honor.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 53 Bushido\"/>  His mate, Sora, wanted him to ask her to go with him, but was turned down, as Yama felt that she would also share in his shame.  He was attacked shortly thereafter by Dingo, Matrix, and Robyn.  After the fight, Robyn approached Yama to recruit him into The Redemption Squad.  She stated that he would have a chance for atonement, and that refusing to join would expose his clan to the world.  He joined begrudgingly (as he was not thrilled about working with someone who hunted gargoyles).<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n====Fang/Fred Sykes====\n'''Fang'''/'''Fred Sykes''' (his name revealed in ''Gargoyles: Bad Guys #2'') was a brazen mutate resembling a puma hybrid, the only one of the group that approved of his changed body from the start.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> He tried to overthrow Talon and rule the Labyrinth.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 39 Kingdom\"/> Fang eventually teamed up with Demona and Thailog, only to be apprehended again.  He was later visited by Sevarius, who infiltrated the labyrinth to obtain some test subjects.  Fang joined in to help turn a portion of Manhattan into mutates, but was thwarted by The Redemption Squad.  He was nearly executed by Yama for making a joke at the expense of one of the test subjects, who had chosen to commit suicide.  Just as Hunter finished debriefing The Director, she was told that they were to recruit Fang (for unspecified reasons).<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>  He was voiced by [[James Belushi]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\">{{cite episode\n| title = Awakening\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Directors: Saburo Hashimoto, Kazuo Terada; Writers: Eric Luke (story), Michael Reaves (story, teleplay), Greg Weisman (creator)\n| network = syndicated\n| airdate = October 24{{ndash}}28, 1994\n| season = 1\n| number = 1\u20135 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 8 Deadly Force\">{{cite episode\n| title = Deadly Force\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Directors: Saburo Hashimoto, Kazuo Terada; Writers: Michael Reaves (writer), Greg Weisman (creator)\n| network = syndicated\n| airdate = November 18, 1994\n| season = 1\n| number = 8 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 10 The Edge\">{{cite episode\n| title = The Edge\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Directors: Saburo Hashimoto, Kazuo Terada; Writers: Michael Reaves (writer), Greg Weisman (creator)\n| network = syndicated\n| airdate = January 13, 1995\n| season = 1\n| number = 10 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\">{{cite episode\n| title = Long Way to Morning\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Writers: Michael Reaves (written by), Brynne Stephens (writer), Greg Weisman (creator)\n| network = syndicated\n| airdate = January 20, 1995\n| season = 1\n| number = 11 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 13 Reawakening\">{{cite episode\n| title = Reawakening\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Directors: Saburo Hashimoto, Kazuo Terada; Writers: Michael Reaves (written by), Brynne Stephens (writer), Greg Weisman (creator)\n| network = syndicated\n| airdate = February 3, 1995\n| season = 1\n| number = 13 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\">{{cite episode\n| title = Metamorphosis\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| network = syndicated\n| credits = Director: Yeun Young Sang; Writers: Michael Reaves (written by), Lydia Marano (writer), Brynne Stephens (writer)\n| airdate = September 5, 1995\n| season = 2\n| number = 15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 16 Legion\">{{cite episode\n| title = Legion\n| episodelink = List of Gargoyles episodes\n| series = Gargoyles\n| serieslink = Gargoyles (TV series)\n| credits = Writers: Marty Isenberg (writer), Michael Reaves (written by), Robert N.

All gargoyle clans are alike in that each has a particular item, area, or concept that they strive to protect. They are fierce warriors and are incredibly powerful and resilient; their appearance and ferocity often means that humans vilify them as demons and monsters. Most of the world's gargoyle clans do not peacefully co-exist with humans.\n\nGargoyles are particularly notable for entering a sort of stone [[hibernation]], called \"stone sleep\", during the day, during which they resemble Gothic statues. During daylight, they can quickly heal from injury and illness, and are protected from most natural threats. However, this state makes them easy targets for destruction by their enemies and humans who hate them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> The character Anton Sevarius postulated that, in this hibernation, they absorb solar radiation that allows them to store energy; otherwise, he concluded, the strenuous activity of gliding would require a nutritional intake equivalent to eating three cows a day.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> Damage during stone sleep can be fatal to a gargoyle. If a gargoyle dies during its hibernation, its body will remain stone.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/>\n\nGargoyles, despite having large wings, can only fly by [[Gliding flight|gliding]] on [[Vertical draft|updrafts]] and on the [[wind]]. They have sharp claws that can dig into any kind of solid surface, and they can use these to climb vertical surfaces.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> They are also excellent swimmers.\n\nWhile not inherently immortal, gargoyles can be extremely long-lived, a result of stone sleep\u2014which slows or halts their aging process until they wake again the following night. Even in old age, they are not as frail and incapacitated as other creatures. Because they spend half their day asleep as stone, they age at half the rate of a human, thus living twice as long.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 44 Grief\"/>\n\n===The Manhattan Clan===\nThe '''Manhattan Clan''' are the [[protagonist]]s of the series.\n\n* '''[[Goliath (Gargoyles)|Goliath]]''' (voiced by [[Keith David]])&nbsp;\u2013 Goliath is the leader of the Manhattan Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> Goliath is named for the [[Goliath|Biblical giant]] by the people of Castle Wyvern because of his stature at 6&nbsp;ft. 10&nbsp;in. (208&nbsp;cm) and a weight of 400&nbsp;lbs. (181&nbsp;kg).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> By the end of the second season, Goliath has started a romantic relationship with Elisa Maza.\n* '''Hudson''' (voiced by [[Ed Asner]])&nbsp;\u2013 Hudson was an Elder and former leader of the Wyvern Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> He now serves as an advisor to Goliath and the rest of the Manhattan Clan. Hudson took his name from the [[Hudson River|river]] after Elisa explained almost everything has a name.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/>\n* '''Brooklyn''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 The [[rufous]]-skinned, white-haired Brooklyn serves as the clan's second-in-command<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 30 Upgrade\"/> with a somewhat sarcastic and impetuous attitude, but has a talent for [[military tactics|tactics]]. Brooklyn is named for the [[Brooklyn|New York borough]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> He harbors bitter hatred against [[Demona]] after she tricked him. Forty seconds after being whisked away in time by The [[Phoenix Gate]] (but 40 years later, from Brooklyn's perspective), Brooklyn was returned to his correct time, older and with a family.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Lexington''' (voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]])&nbsp;\u2013 Lexington was the smallest of the clan and a technical wizard. Lexington is named from the [[Lexington Avenue|avenue]], which itself [[Lexington Avenue#History|gained that name in 1836]].<ref name=\"STREETBOOK\">Henry Moscow:''The Street Book''.

He holds a soft spot for baby Alex; in the third season, he is shown to act as a sort of babysitter and spoils him with new toys. Following the series' run on television and the release of the SLG ''Clan-Building'' Gargoyles comics, Weisman himself has hinted that Lexington may be of same-sex preference, but unrecognized by the character himself at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=8065 |title=Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles! |page=8065 |last1=Weisman |first1=Greg |date=May 5, 2005  |website=s8.org |publisher=Station Eight |access-date=April 10, 2016 |quote=\"Greg responds...'I think the blurb you quoted MIS-represented what I said at that Gathering.

Broadway is named for the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|street]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> Broadway has developed a strong dislike of [[guns]] and a great appreciation for old movies (particularly detective ones),<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 8 Deadly Force\"/> as well as a newfound and rapidly developing appreciation for reading and literary works.  He later develops a relationship with Angela.\n* '''Bronx''' (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bronx is a dog-like gargoyle beast. Bronx is named for the [[The Bronx|New York borough]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1\u20135 Awakening, Part 1\u20135\"/> He often stays with Hudson within the clan's residence, keeping him company while watching television.\n* '''Angela''' (voiced by [[Brigitte Bako]])&nbsp;\u2013 Angela is the daughter of Goliath<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 40 Monsters\"/> and Demona.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/> She was raised on Avalon like a human, thus making her more willing to trust others,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> and joined the Manhattan clan in the middle of the second season. Angela is so named because of her [[angel]]ic nature,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> Angela literally meaning \"She-Angel\".  She later develops a relationship with Broadway, after letting \"the trio\" (Broadway, Brooklyn and Lexington) know she does not tolerate nicknames being used for her.\n* '''Fu-Dog'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fu-Dog is a green-skinned leonine gargoyle beast, closely resembling a [[Chinese guardian lions|Chinese statuary lion]] in appearance from the [[Shangdu|Xanadu]] Clan in China who, at some unspecified time, joins Brooklyn on his journey through the time-stream. He is fiercely loyal to Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Katana'''&nbsp;\u2013 Katana comes from the Ishimura Clan during feudal era Japan, and is Brooklyn's sky-blue hued mate, with a similar but smaller beak when compared to her mate. Named for the [[Katana|most famous form of Japanese sword]], she joined him on his Timedancer journey. During their adventures, she and Brooklyn had an egg which hatched into Nashville. She has a second egg, Egwardo, which she is very protective of, as shown by her carrying it (before it hatches in 1998) with her everywhere in a compact backpack.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Nashville'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nashville is the son of Brooklyn and Katana. He closely resembled Brooklyn, but had Katana's pale blue skin color and bluish-black hair. He is called '''Gnash''' for short.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n* '''Egwardo'''&nbsp;\u2013 Egwardo is a yet-to-be-hatched gargoyle egg. Its parents were Brooklyn and Katana.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>  Egwardo hatched as a female in 1998, and was given the name \"Tachi\", possibly named for the [[Tachi|predecessor of the sword her mother is named for]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=6538\n| title = Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles!\n| page = 6538\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = December 3, 2003\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n* '''Othello''' (voiced by [[Michael Dorn]])&nbsp;\u2013 Othello was a rookery brother to Goliath who is shown to be hot-headed.

He convinced Othello that Desdemona was secretly pursuing a relationship with Goliath.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 16 Legion\"/>  He was eventually transferred into the robot shell of Coldsteel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 62 Possession\"/>  Upon Demona's reactivation of the Coldstone robot, Iago took control of the body, until Othello was convinced to help Goliath and clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 26 High Noon\"/>  In 1996, Coldsteel aided Xanatos and Coyote 5.0. in retrieving the Stone of Destiny, in exchange for removing a tracking device from his body.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> The name Iago was used only in the script and credits.<ref name=\"greg 3563\"/> Voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]].\n\n===Demona===\n{{Main|Demona}}\n'''Demona''' (voiced by [[Marina Sirtis]]) - Goliath's former mate<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and Angela's biological mother;<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/> who is no longer frozen in stone by daylight  like the others, thanks to Puck's pre-Gathering intervention.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 18 The Mirror\"/> She has been continuously alive for a millennium, because of a magical pact with [[Macbeth (Gargoyles)|Macbeth]] granted to them by the series' version of the [[List of Gargoyles characters#The Weird Sisters|Three Witches]], giving both of them nearly-irrevocable immortality. Demona developed a hatred of all humans, making her an enemy of the clan. She was named by Macbeth, after her [[Demon|demonic]] fighting skills,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Demona literally meaning \"She-Demon\". Over the centuries that she has been alive, Demona was the enemy of the Canmore family, who all took on the moniker of The Hunter; because of this, Demona was indirectly responsible for the destruction of the Manhattan Clan's clock tower home.\n\n===Avalon Clan===\nThe '''[[Avalon Clan]]''' are the gargoyle eggs of Castle Wyvern that were protected by Princess Katharine, Tom, and the Magus. The eggs were taken to [[Places in Disney's Gargoyles|Avalon]], where they hatched and grew to adulthood.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> Members of the clan include Gabriel (the son of Coldstone and Coldfire), Ophelia, the gargoyle beast Boudicca, and other unnamed members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 55 Ill Met By Moonlight\"/> Katharine and Tom raised them as their own children, and thus gave each a name to be told apart from each other, so the Avalon Clan holds great respect for them.\n\n===London Clan===\nThe '''London Clan''' are a prosperous [[England|English]] clan resembling the creatures of [[heraldry]]. The London Clan roosted at a country estate called Knight's Spur.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> They also ran a magic shop in [[London]] to supplement their income, and until the mid-1990s (the timeframe of the ''Gargoyles'' series) had abandoned their mission of protection. Their names were derived from the heraldic creatures they were based on: Leo ([[lion]]), Leo's mate Una ([[unicorn]], and the clan's leader), Griff ([[griffin]]),<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 43&nbsp;M.I.A.\"/> Staghart ([[White stag#Symbolism|stag]], [http://gargwiki.net/Staghart rumored to have a close friendship with Lexington]), Constance ([[Pig|sow]]), Old Pog ([[hippogriff]]) as the clan's eldest member, Lunette ([[winged unicorn]], as she is Leo and Una's daughter, born the same year as Brooklyn's son Nashville) and 189 other members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\n===Clan Ishimura===\n'''Clan Ishimura''' was a gargoyle clan in [[Japan]] and the only clan thus far that lived in harmony with humans, teaching them ''[[Bushido]]'', (lit. the \"Way of the Warrior\"), since feudal times. It includes Kai, (lit. \"The [[Ocean]]\" or \"The [[Sea]]\"), the Clan leader, Sora, (lit. \"The [[Sky]]\" or \"The [[Heaven]]s\"), Yama (lit. \"The [[Mountain]]\"), who was banished from the clan for criminal activity \u2014 resulting in his joining Robyn Canmore's ''Redemption Squad'' unit in the future to atone for his own  misdeeds \u2014 and many other unnamed members.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 53 Bushido\"/> In the ''Gargoyles'' comic series issue \"The Lost\", it is revealed that the gargoyles of Japan are properly called [http://gargwiki.net/Tengu tengu], as a possible inspiration for [[Tengu|Japan's folkloric creatures]] with similar physical characteristics.\n\n===Guatemala Clan===\nThe '''Guatemala Clan''' members are protectors of the Guatemalan rainforest and associated with the [[Kaqchikel people]]'s culture. The four surviving gargoyles of the clan wore special talismans linked to a special occultly-enchanted artifact called the Mayan Sun Amulet, that let them avoid their stone sleep. Their names are [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words for precious [[gemstones]]\u2014 the red-skinned, legless Zafiro ([[sapphire]]) as the clan's leader, with a unique feather-winged appearance reminiscent of the Mayan deity [[Kukulkan]] but with human-form arms, or possibly one of the cuoatl, specifically [[Quetzalcoatl]], the winged serpent; the green-skinned Jade (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0251\u02d0|d|e\u026a}} {{respell|HAH|day}}, as it would be pronounced in Spanish) with a facial appearance reminiscent of Goliath; and the blue-skinned females Turquesa ([[turquoise]]); and Obsidiana ([[obsidian]]), who has developed skills as an herbalist (similar to Maya [[ethnobotanist|ethnobotany]]) with medicinal plants of the rain forest, in healing physical injuries. Due to malicious business actions initiated in 1993 by the Cyberbiotics Corporation's Preston Vogel in and near the clan's rain forest protectorate (see below), a sizable number of the Guatemala Clan's earlier gargoyle membership was destroyed in stone slumber only a few years before the \"Avalon World Tour\" visit to them by Goliath, Angela, Elisa and Bronx; without the Guatemala Clan's rookery of gargoyle eggs ever being discovered in the tragic event.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 51 The Green\"/>\n\n===Labyrinth Clan===\nThe '''Labyrinth Clan''' lived underground, protecting the homeless individuals who also lived there.\n\n====The Mutates====\nThe '''Mutates''' were created when Sevarius combined animal genes with humans in an attempt to create gargoyle-like creatures for Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> They rebelled against Xanatos,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> and now protect the homeless in the underground facility known as the Labyrinth.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 39 Kingdom\"/> They also take care of the clones. All the Mutates resembled humanoid cats with bat-like wings on their backs (giving them enough strength to glide), and had the ability to store and discharge electricity, due to having electric eel DNA and the associated storage organ to naturally accumulate an electric charge.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/>\n;Talon\n:'''Talon''' became the leader of the Mutate Clan; originally, he was against leadership as he preferred everyone being equal, but took control when Fang attempted mutiny. Resembled a black panther hybrid. Talon was originally Derek Maza, Elisa Maza's younger brother. He took a job as a pilot for David Xanatos, with a series of events leading to his mutation. The mutate Maggie Reed is shown to love him, and the feeling is mutual.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> Voiced by [[Rocky Carroll]].\n;Fang\n:'''Fang''' was originally a member of the Mutate Clan but eventually betrayed them. He resembled a puma hybrid with bat wings. Fang was a human named Fred Sykes before Sevarius mutated him. He found several laser rifles and used them and a pair of human followers to attempt to take over the Labyrinth where the mutates lived.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 39 Kingdom\"/> He later joined forces with Thailog and Demona.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 48 Pendragon\"/> He is a loud mouthed bully who likes dominating those weaker than himself,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> which causes Yama to become antagonistic towards him as both Yama and Fang are eventual members of Robyn Canmore's ''Redemption Squad''. He is voiced by [[James Belushi]].\n;Claw\n:'''Claw''' is a strong-but-silent Mutate.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> The transformation process rendered him [[Speech disorder|mute]], brought on by either physical damage or psychological trauma (it is never specified). Resembled a tiger hybrid.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> Claw is shown to be a coward, doing what he is told out of fear; however, he has brief moments of bravery.\n;Maggie Reed\n:'''Maggie Reed''' is an innocent young homeless woman who was tricked by Sevarius, she was the most desperate to find a cure for her condition. Brooklyn had a crush on her for a time,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> but she fell in love with Talon/Derek.  Maggie was listed in the show's credits as ''Maggie the Cat'', an allusion to the female lead in the play ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. Maggie was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]. Maggie resembled a lion hybrid.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 32 The Cage\"/> In the comic continuation, it was revealed that she was pregnant with Talon's child.\n\n=====Non-combat Mutates=====\nTo continue with his experiments in mutating, Sevarius and Fang abducted four residents of the Labyrinth.\n;Thug\n:'''Thug''' was in charge of guarding Fang's cell, before he was freed by Sevarius.  Mutated into a human [[crocodile]].  He took the two kids back to the Labyrinth.\n;Tasha\n:'''Tasha''' was a woman who was mutated into a human [[armadillo]].  She committed suicide after discovering that Sevarius had no intent to cure them.\n;Benny\n:'''Benny''' is a boy who was mutated into a human [[woodlouse]].\n;Erin\n:'''Erin''' is a girl who was mutated into a human [[turtle]].  She is Benny's older sister.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\nBoth Benny and Erin are modeled after Greg Weisman's kids.

Their intellects were originally deliberately stunted to make them obedient to Thailog, but with Thailog's supposed death they regained their freedom. Talon offered to take the clones with him to the Labyrinth to educate them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 61 The Reckoning\"/>  Issues 3 to 5 of the comic depict Thailog later going to Castle Wyvern to persuade the clones to rejoin him, as they still had not developed free will at that time. After a battle with Goliath and his clan, most of the clones decide to return to the Labyrinth, at the insistence of Delilah. Only Brentwood decides to remain with Thailog.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\n* '''Malibu''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) - Malibu is the clone of Brooklyn. There are hints to a possible relationship between Malibu and Delilah (much to the disappointment of Brooklyn, before his initial meeting with his own future mate Katana).<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n* '''Brentwood''' (voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]]) - Brentwood is the clone of Lexington. Unlike the other clones, he decides to remain with Thailog, viewing him to be smart. He was the only clone, however, to stay out of the fight between the clans. Brentwood parallels with the evil Lexington from ''Future Tense''. (Lex comments on his decision, saying \"You're really making me look bad.\")<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n* '''Hollywood''' (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]) - Hollywood is the clone of Broadway.\n* '''Burbank''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]]) - Burbank is the clone of Hudson. Much like Hudson, Burbank carries a weapon, in his case, a mace. and lacks the injured left eye Hudson still possesses.\n* '''Delilah''' (voiced by [[Salli Richardson]]) - Delilah is not an exact clone; she is a [[wiktionary:binary clone|binary clone]] of Demona and Elisa's DNA, programmed to be a servile concubine for Thailog, replacing Demona. Delilah is voiced by [[Salli Richardson]]. Goliath went to the Labyrinth requesting Delilah's company for a Halloween dance (as Elisa had broken up with him). After Thailog crashes the party, Delilah is given the choice to remain with Thailog or go back to The Labyrinth. After deciding to leave Thailog, she asked the other clones to make the same choice, and was joined by all of them except for Brentwood. Delilah was angry that Goliath tried to use her as a replacement for Elisa when they temporarily broke up. Goliath had explained to Elisa that he could never feel anything for Delilah, because Gargoyles mate for life.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n:In the unmade spinoff, ''Gargoyles 2198'', Delilah's eponymous descendant would have been a main character, close friends with Samson (the grandson of Broadway and Angela, resembling Goliath).<ref name=\"2198faq\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/faq.php?s=gargs2198\n| title = Gargoyles FAQ: Gargoyles 2198\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n* '\"Anton\"' also called Little Anton - Made by Sevarius using the DNA from all the gargoyles.\n\nThe clones differ from the originals by their colors, and some features like horns or teeth.  To gain a physical advantage, Malibu, Brentwood, Hollywood and Burbank were aged to be in their biological 20s: older than the young trio, yet younger than Hudson.\n\nThe clones' names are places in [[Los Angeles]], contrasting with and spoofing (as chosen by Demona) their counterpart protagonists' New York City placenames.\n\n===Thailog===\n'''Thailog''' (''Thailog'' is the reverse spelling of \"Goliath\"), was a [[cloning|clone]] of Goliath created by Anton Sevarius and educated by David Xanatos, (via a \"[[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] [[education]] program\"), giving him many of Xanatos's [[personality]] traits. He would prove to be both a [[genius]] and a persistent enemy. Thailog debuts in season 2, in ''Double Jeopardy'', which aired in November 1995.  Like Goliath, he was also voiced by [[Keith David]]. A \"monster\", in Xanatos' words. Goliath's body and Xanatos' mind. \n\nDeciding that he would never be free under Xanatos' thumb, Thailog planned his own [[kidnapping]] by Sevarius, blackmails Xanatos for 20 million dollars for his safe return, and, after meeting his genetic source, Goliath, for the first time, seemingly perishes in an explosion.  Xanatos later guesses that Thailog had planned to fake his death all along, leaving him both free of Xanatos, and free to spend the 20 million without interference.  Xanatos realizes that he has created a monster, one as strong as Goliath, and as smart as, (if not smarter than), himself.\n\nUnder the name \"''Alexander Thailog''\", Thailog would later form a [[partnership]]/relationship with Demona, (business-wise they formed a company, called \"''Nightstone Unlimited''\"), but was planning to let her and Macbeth die, in order to inherit both their fortunes. (Demona, in her human form, planned to marry Macbeth and then claim that he was dead in order to inherit his fortune, Thailog planned to kill Macbeth and Demona and as her sole business partner, her Banker, he would inherit their combined fortunes).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/>  Both of them later commissioned Sevarius to create a clan of clones, which he eventually betrayed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 42 Sanctuary\"/>\n\nThailog eventually \"dies\", (or, more accurately, lapses into a permanent stone sleep), in the third season of the animated series, but Thailog is depicted as alive in the canonical SLG Comic Book.\n\nThe dynamics between Thailog and Xanatos somewhat mirror that of [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[cloning|clone]] of [[Superman]] in ''Vatman'', in [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (season 1)|season one]] of [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]], which aired in March 1994.\n\n==Humans==\nIn addition to the gargoyles, human characters figure prominently in the series, both as allies and enemies of the gargoyles.\n\n===Residents of Castle Wyvern 954-994===\n\n====Princess Katharine====\n'''Princess Katarine''' is the leader of Castle Wyvern (and, by default, the Scottish clan of gargoyles) during the 990s. Katharine was at first prejudiced against the clan, but after they saved her life, she vowed to protect the clans' unhatched eggs<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and raise them on Avalon.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> She was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]].\n\n====Katherine's parents====\n;Prince Malcolm\n:'''Prince Malcolm''' was Katharine's father, the previous lord of Wyvern Castle, Hudson's good friend, and brother to [[Kenneth II of Scotland|King Kenneth]]. He formed a co-existence alliance with the gargoyles who had been there for centuries, and built Castle Wyvern. Goliath, Demona, and Hudson saved his life from an attack by the Archmage. He also inadvertently inspired hatred of gargoyles at Wyvern, particularly in Princess Katharine\u2014he told her that the gargoyles would get her if she didn't stay in bed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> He was apparently deceased by the time of the Viking attack in 994.  Voiced by [[Roger Rees]].\n;Princess Elena\n:'''Princess Elena''' is Katherine's mother.  She married Prince Malcolm in 975, and intended to give him the Phoenix Gate as a dowry (until it was stolen by Demona).  Voiced by Kath Soucie.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/>\n\n====The Magus====\n'''The Magus''' was a court magician of Castle Wyvern and Katharine's top advisor. It was the Magus who cast the spell that imprisoned Goliath's clan in stone, believing that the Viking Hakon had murdered the Princess and blaming the gargoyles for her death. He later discovered that Princess Katharine had been rescued by Goliath; unable to restore the gargoyles (as Hakon had burned the page with his counterspell), he agreed to place Goliath under the same spell, so that he might one day be reunited with his clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> The Magus guided Princess Katharine and the eggs to Avalon, and harbored unrequited feelings for the princess for many years. He died after using a great deal of energy to defeat the Weird Sisters.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n====Tom the Guardian====\nIn 10th-century Scotland, Tom was a peasant boy at Wyvern Castle, who was eager to make friends with the gargoyles, especially the future-named Lexington & Brooklyn, despite his mother's objections. He also accompanied Princess Katherine and the gargoyle eggs to Avalon, where he took on the role of Guardian, protecting the eggs & training the young gargoyles when they hatched. While living on Avalon, the adult Tom became Katharine's confidante, and eventually her husband.\n\n====Mary====\n'''Mary''', Tom the Guardian's mother, was fiercely anti-gargoyle like Katharine,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> but had a change of heart as she, too, vowed to protect the eggs. Along with Finnella, she did not go to Avalon, instead choosing to stay on Earth and guard the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'', stating that, \"a woman alone might run into trouble: two women can cause plenty of it\".<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> When a Timedancing Brooklyn arrived in Scotland in 997, Mary recognized him as one of the gargoyles from Goliath's clan.  Together, the three of them joined Constantine's enemies, led by King Kenneth III.  She and Finella would continue guarding the ''Grimorum'' while leaving 997 with Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>  In October 1996, Mary (or a woman resembling her) attended a Halloween party atop The Eyrie Building.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n\n====The Archmage====\n'''The Archmage''' was an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and an enemy of the gargoyle clan at Castle Wyvern. He was defeated by Goliath,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 11 Long Way to Morning\"/> but his future self saved him from his fall in a perpetual time paradox\u2014as his future self existed in the 1990s, and rescued his past self, without any explanation for how the loop began. The Archmage continues to live through this loop, despite his later defeat, after rescuing himself in the past.\n\nThe Archmage was encouraged to conquer the world, but first had to retrieve the trio of occult objects he most desired, the \"three keys to power\" in the series, comprising: the ancient book of magic spells named the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'', the Phoenix Gate and the Eye of Odin; as well as to conquer Avalon as a base of operations. His future self secured an alliance with the Weird Sisters to watch out for the mystical artifacts, as well as guide the destinies of Demona and Macbeth, advising them to bend Oberon's law of non-interference.\n\nThe \"Future Archmage\" brought his past self nearly a thousand years into the future, where his past self swallowed the ''Grimorum'' in order for the spellbook to be brought onto the island (\"human magic\" is not allowed on Avalon by law; consuming it created a \"legal loophole\"), thus making him very powerful. However, he was defeated by Goliath, who stripped him of the Eye of Odin, causing the ''Grimorum'' to turn the Archmage into a pile of dust.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/>  During some unspecified time, the enhanced Archmage undertook additional time travel, thus meeting a Timedancing Brooklyn.<ref name=\"greg archives 24\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/archives.php?lid=24\n| title = Ask Greg Archives: Timedancer\n| page = 24\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = December 17, 2009\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref> He was voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]].\n\n====The Captain of the Guard====\n'''The Captain of the Guard''' was the head of Castle Wyvern's [[garrison]] in 994. Resentful of the lack of appreciation that he and the gargoyles received for defending the castle, he struck a deal with Demona and the Vikings to have the castle [[Looting|sacked]], forcing out the humans and leaving only him and the gargoyles. The plan included sabotage, such as severing bowstrings, but backfired when the Viking leader Hakon shattered most of the gargoyles during the day after the siege, prompting Goliath and the survivors (Hudson, Brooklyn, Broadway, Lexington and Bronx) to go after the Vikings for revenge. The Captain was killed along with Hakon in 994, when they fell off a cliff,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> but their spirits remained trapped in the area as punishment for their actions. When Goliath returned to the Wyvern site a thousand years later, the Captain and Hakon, in spirit form, attempted to steal Goliath's [[Energy (esotericism)|lifeforce]] and thus free themselves from the area. He stopped midway, after realizing his guilt for his treachery, and instead turned on Hakon. Having atoned for his sins, his spirit was set free to rest in peace.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 37 Shadows of the Past\"/> Voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]].\n\n===Residents of New York===\n\n====Elisa Maza====\n'''[[Elisa Maza]]''' is a NYPD detective, friend of the Gargoyles,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> and later love interest for Goliath.

He is eternally bound to Demona and is forced to live in conflict with her forever; neither one can die until one simultaneously kills the other.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Initially an enemy of the gargoyles, he later becomes their ally. He tried to claim the sword Excalibur for himself but did not succeed in doing this. After being impressed with Macbeth's skills and honorable behavior King Arthur offered him a place in the New Round Table. Macbeth, while honored, refused this offer because he felt he could not submit to Arthur's rule as he was a [[self-made man]]. But, Macbeth offered his services should there ever be a crisis. He sometimes uses the alias Lennox Macduff (after two characters in the Shakespeare play). He was voiced by [[John Rhys-Davies]].\n\n=====Macbeth's family=====\n;[[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]]\n:'''Duncan''' was the ancient king of Scotland, Macbeth's foe, and the second to wear the Hunter mask. He secretly ordered the death of Macbeth's father, and destroyed the few remaining gargoyles in Scotland. It was because of Duncan that the Weird Sisters forged the spell between Macbeth and Demona.

Finella did not follow Katharine and company onto Avalon, instead choosing to guard the ''Grimorum Arcanorum'' with help from Tom's mother Mary.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/>\n\nIn 997, while Timedancing, Brooklyn arrived to save Finella and Mary from one of Constantine's soldiers.

For a time, Cuchulainn mistakes Bronx for the legendary [[Hound of Ulster]].  He was voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]].\n;Nick (Natsilane)\n:A Native American youth of the Pacific Northwest, '''Nick''' (born '''[[Natsilane]]''', presumably named for or descended from the legendary hero) initially rejects his heritage for the realities of the modern world.

However, the Emir planned on using Anubis to resurrect his dead son, who he felt was unfairly taken away from him in a \"pointless car accident\". Jackal hijacked the ceremony, but the Emir was able to usurp Anubis's power back. As the avatar of death, the Emir finally realized the role death plays in the world and that it cannot be meddled with, as much has humans want to. He reversed everything Jackal had done as the avatar, and sacrificed himself to free Anubis.

As a result, Yama took on Taro and defeated him in one-on-one combat. Voiced by [[James Saito]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 53 Bushido\"/> \n;Shaman\n:An [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigine]] wise man, who became Dingo's spiritual advisor when the latter decided to wipe the slate clean regarding his past.

They were not all literally descended from Oberon, but he was their leader and he governed all of the Third Race under a strictly-enforced set of rules. They possessed incredible powers, were apparently immortal, but had a fatal weakness to any form of iron in proximity to them. Regardless, as long as they were in the real world, Oberon forbade them from interfering in human events. However, many of the Third Race (particularly the Weird Sisters), as well as humans and gargoyles, have realized that Oberon's laws can be bent even if they cannot be broken.\n\n===Oberon===\n'''[[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]''' was the lord of Avalon. He possessed [[god]]like powers and was the most powerful being in the whole series. Very arrogant and impudent, it was by his edict that Avalon was abandoned and the Third Race forced to live with humanity, partially due to Titania's habit of interfering directly in mortal affairs. Oberon later himself left Avalon to join them. He was also responsible for ''The Gathering,'' in which the Third Race left the rest of the world and congregated in Avalon.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> He was voiced by [[Terrence Mann]].\n\n===Titania===\n'''[[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]]''' was Oberon's (recently remarried) wife and Queen of Avalon.

A highly skilled manipulator, she aided the [[Manhattan Clan|Manhattan]]<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> and [[Avalon Clan]]s on several occasions, frequently keeping Oberon in check and teaching him some humility. She was voiced by [[Kate Mulgrew]].\n\n===The Weird Sisters===\n'''[[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]]''' &ndash; '''Phoebe''', '''Selene''', and '''Luna''' &ndash; were a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of powerful magic users named after three [[Greco-Roman]] goddesses of the [[Moon]] and based on the witches from Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]''. The sisters appeared sporadically throughout early episodes in various guises, but eventually revealed their hand in looking after Demona and Macbeth, being the ones who linked their fates and made them immortal.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 22-25 City of Stone, Part 1-4\"/> Their overarching motivation, however, is to aid the Archmage in gaining revenge upon Katherine, Tom, and the Magus,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 34-36 Avalon, Part 1-3\"/> who had outwitted them and gained entry to Avalon in spite of Oberon's ban. Following the Archmage's defeat, the Weird Sisters generally stopped stirring up trouble and were content to serve Oberon again following his return. They were last seen forcibly bringing the Banshee before Oberon at the Gathering.\n\nThe blond-haired sister is named [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], who embodies [[Divine grace|grace]]. The black-haired sister is named [[Selene]], who embodies [[Revenge|vengeance]]. And the silver-haired one is named [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and who embodies [[fate]]; all three are named for moon goddesses of classical mythology. All three sisters were voiced by [[Kath Soucie]].\n\n===Puck/Owen===\n'''[[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]''' was a trickster fairy. His magic was the reason why [[Demona]] became human during the day, instead of turning to stone.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 18 The Mirror\"/> It was eventually discovered that he was Owen Burnett, having made a deal with [[David Xanatos|Xanatos]] to serve him faithfully. Because of this deal and his affinity for humans, he was banished from Avalon and had the use of his powers \"hard-limited\" by Oberon. Since the Gathering, Puck could only use his powers within Oberon's strictly imposed limits: meaning they were only usable when Puck was teaching or protecting his employer's son, Alexander Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> In the third season, this was shown to be a drawback; Owen was rendered unconscious when Alexander was kidnapped by the Quarrymen, leaving Puck unable to save the boy. He was voiced by [[Brent Spiner]].\n\n===Minor children of Oberon===\nThe rest of the Children of Oberon were [[fairies]], [[Deity|gods]], and other various creatures from cultures and mythologies worldwide that lived in [[Places in Disney's Gargoyles|Avalon]] until they were all expelled by Oberon. They were forcibly called back to Avalon by him one thousand years later in an event known as ''The Gathering''.\n\n;[[Anansi]]\n:'''Anansi''' is a spider trickster of African myth. He can literally spin spells using his web, which is also his weakness; if his web is taken apart, Anansi is powerless. His magic can change the shape of living creatures.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 47 Mark of the Panther\"/> Voiced by [[LeVar Burton]]\n;[[Anubis]]\n:'''Anubis''' is the ancient Egyptian Jackal Lord and avatar of death. Those who became his avatar and used his powers could reduce or advance the ages of others, but few were worthy enough to wield it. Voiced by [[Tony Jay]]\n;[[Banshee]]\n:'''Banshee''' is an Irish fairy with a powerful wailing scream, and the modern archenemy of [[Irish mythology in popular culture#C\u00fa Chulainn|Cu Chulainn]]. Goliath, Eliza and Angela encountered her on their adventure to Ireland.  She objected to The Gathering and was forcibly brought to Avalon by the Weird Sisters before being attacked by Odin for her insolence. Oberon silences Banshee by sealing her mouth.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> - Voiced by [[Sheena Easton]]\n;[[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]]\n:'''Coyote''' is a Native American trickster spirit. He primarily appeared as the younger self of Elisa's father, though he can also take the form of a [[whirlwind]].

The Eye of Odin, a magical item that featured prominently in the series, is his actual eye as known of in Norse lengend, preserved as a jewel-like magical artifact on Avalon in the distant past, and amicably returned to him by Goliath in the \"Avalon World Tour\" story arc's episode entitled ''Eye of the Storm''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/archives.php?lid=91 |title=Gargoyles - Ask Greg Archives - Odin - \" This day in Gargoyles' Universe History...May 21st...1996\" |last=Weisman |first=Greg |date=May 21, 2007 |website=s8.org |publisher=Station Eight |access-date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Goliath challenges Odin, and the two \"gods\" do battle.

A robot named [[Talos]]\u2014an upgraded version of the Talos first constructed by [[Daedalus]] and also voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]\u2014is a high-level advisor. A villainous shapeshifter named [[Proteus]] (voiced by [[Roddy McDowall]]) seemed to be the island's worst criminal. Other named members of the race included [[Helios]] (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]), [[Echidna (mythology)|Ekidna]] (voiced by Charity James), and [[Chiron|Kiron]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). In the last two instances, the use of the letter \"k\" in the spelling was intended by the show's creators to differentiate the characters from their mythological namesakes.\n\nThe New Olympians appeared during the \"Avalon World Tour\" story arc in the episode ''The New Olympians'', in which [[Elisa Maza]] arrived on the island along with her three \"gargoyle\" companions (Goliath, his daughter Angela, and Bronx). Because of their experiences with the human race\u2014Taurus at one point specifically mentions the murder of his ancestor by [[Theseus]]\u2014the New Olympians harbored a strong hatred against Elisa and humans in general. This inverts the show's usual premise, in which many humans are prejudiced against creatures such as gargoyles. After an encounter with Proteus, Elisa managed to convince some New Olympians\u2014particularly Taurus\u2014that not all humans are evil.\n\nA spinoff show, itself entitled ''The New Olympians'', was planned; the ''Gargoyles'' episode featuring the characters was a \"[[backdoor pilot]]\". A series [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] was produced, revealing that the new series' storyline would have revolved around the New Olympians revealing themselves to humanity in front of the United Nations. The pitch, which is shown at [[The Gathering (Gargoyles)|Gathering conventions]], introduced several new characters and hinted at a [[Romeo and Juliet]]-style romance between Sphinx (a New Olympian female) and Terry Chung (a human male). Although the series was never picked up, Greg Weisman has said that elements would have been included in the main ''Gargoyles'' series had it continued.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Terry Chung appears as a trick or treater in the ''Gargoyles'' comic issue number four, which places the beginning of ''New Olympians'' at least a decade after the 2006 issues.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  He appears with during New Year's Eve of 1996 with his first cousin Tri Chung.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/><ref name=\"greg 10963\"/>\n\nProteus escapes to New York to exact his revenge. Taurus leaves New Olympus to pursue him.  This is not considered canon by Weisman.<ref name=\"Goliath Chron 12\"/>\n\n===Nokkar===\n'''Nokkar''' was a [[Border guard|sentinel]] and member of the [[N'Kai]] (interstellar [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] who oppose the [[Space-Spawn]] empire), Nokkar waited on [[Easter Island]] to protect the [[Earth]]. While there, he was revered as a [[god]] by the [[natives]], and the [[Moai|Easter Island Statues]] were modeled after him. He once captured Goliath and Angela, believing them to be [[Space-Spawn]] in disguise. Until the quartet of the \"Avalon World Tour\" visit Easter Island, Nokkar does not yet know of the Earth's gargoyle population, and is resultingly confused, thinking that they are with the aliens he is guarding against. In addition, Nokkar has never had any contact with any of the residents of Avalon, the children of Oberon, or any of the New Olympians. He was voiced by [[Avery Brooks]].\n\n===Tazmanian Tiger===\n'''Tazmanian Tiger''' was a supervillain who robbed a bank in [[Sydney]].  His actions caught the attention of Dingo and Matrix (both of whom were Australia's crimefighters). He wore a skin tight costume and mask. His gloves had a set of razor sharp claws that were able to damage Matrix. He was assisted by two [[thylacine]]s named Benjamin and Natasha.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n==Organizations and groups==\n\n===The Illuminati===\nIn the ''Gargoyles'' universe, '''[[Illuminati|The Illuminati]]''' were a secret society started by [[Sir Percival]], the [[Fisher King]], that controlled and manipulated a large portion of the world, including politics and organized crime. Xanatos was a member of the Illuminati, which aided him in making his fortune (through a predestination paradox\u2014Xanatos had instructed himself to travel through time).<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/> Bluestone was inducted into the society after gangster Mace Malone's failed attempt to capture Goliath.  Matt's former partner in the FBI, Martin Hacker, was also a member of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/> Thailog joined as a new member at some unspecified time, and was the first gargoyle known to be part of the Society.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  The Society was last seen headed by Peredur fab Ragnal.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nEach member was of a certain numerical rank. When two members of the society encountered each other in private, they would share their rank.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\n====Peredur fab Ragnal====\n'''Peredur fab Ragnal''' is introduced in the trade paperback for the comic, as the story introducing him was not published as a single issue.  He was the leader of The Illuminati, and, through Quincy Hemmings, ordered Xanatos to steal The Stone of Destiny while it was being returned to Scotland.  To his disappointment, there were 3 stones which the Spirit of Destiny inhabited, but from it he learned that Arthur had reawakened.  Since Arthur was not supposed to awaken for another 200 years, Peredur decides to hold a meeting of the higher-echelon members, since this development could affect their (unspecified) plans.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Ragnal does not appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Jude Law]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\"/>\n\n====Fleur====\n'''Fleur''', originally known as \"Blanchefleur\", is introduced in the trade paperback edition of the comic, as the story introducing her was not published as a single issue.  She is Peredur's wife, and met Xanatos in a warehouse after he apparently stole the Stone of Destiny.  She discovered that Arthur Pendragon awakened after eavesdropping on a message that the Stone conveyed to Peredur.  Like Duval, Fleur was also important to Peredur, but Fleur has had an occasionally contentious relationship with Duval,<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/> and envisioned actress [[Rhona Mitra]] to voice the character for potential animation.\n\n====Matt Bluestone====\n'''Matt Bluestone''' is a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] and a [[Detective Sergeant]] in the [[NYPD]].  He was a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who was assigned to be Elisa's partner after the shooting incident.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 8 Deadly Force\"/> The NYPD 23rd [[police precinct|Precinct]]'s Captain, Maria Chavez, thought it was too dangerous for Elisa to be working on her own after she was shot, and assigned Bluestone as her new partner so that she would have someone covering her back\u2014despite Elisa's adamant protests that she did not need a partner. Bluestone is a big believer in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], especially the [[Illuminati]].<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 10 The Edge\"/>  He was one of the few humans who were friends with the Manhattan Clan. The Illuminati were impressed enough with Matt persistence that they made him a member; ironically, this works in his favor in trying to expose them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/> He was voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]].\n\n====Martin Hacker====\n'''Martin Hacker''' was Matt Bluestone's former partner in the FBI<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 19 The Silver Falcon\"/> and an Illuminati operative, Hacker's job was to intentionally mislead Matt away from the Illuminati. When this failed, it was Martin who conferred membership onto Matt on the behalf of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/>\n\nAfter Manhattan discovers the existence of gargoyles, Hacker checks in on Matt Bluestone and John Castaway, as well as giving Xanatos an invitation to the White House from the Illuminati.  While meeting all three of them, he claims a different objective from The Illuminati. With Matt Bluestone, he claims that the Illuminati agree that people aren't ready to encounter gargoyles. With Xanatos, he says the Illuminati feel it is time for humans and gargoyles to meet. As for John Castaway, he claimed that the Illuminati agree that the gargoyles should be destroyed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>  He was voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]].\n\n====Norman Ambassador====\nThe unnamed '''Norman Ambassador''' escorted Princess Elena to Castle Wyvern in 975.  Both were attacked by the Archmage's bandits and rescued by Xanatos (who followed Demona into the past).  Out of gratitude, and due to being a fellow Illuminatus, he allowed Xanatos and his family to join them at Wyvern.  He also took a couple of envelopes with him at Xanatos' request\u2014one containing a rare coin to give to a younger David Xanatos in 1975; the other containing details on how the coin was obtained, thus inspiring himself to travel back in time.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 21 Vows\"/>\n\n====Mace Malone====\n'''Mace Malone''' was a leading gangster in the 1920s who was recruited into the Illuminati because of his underworld dealings.  In 1924, the crime syndicates became aware of their vulnerability to the Illuminati, resulting in Mace having to disappear.  He had a long life due to rejuvenation drugs.  His habit of visiting Flo Dane alerted Matt Bluestone to his presence, who saw a photo with Mace wearing a society emblem and received confirmation of his suspicions from Mace's stepson Jack.  As a result, Matt was offered membership if he brought a gargoyle to the abandoned Hotel Cabal, an Illuminati base.  Though Matt brought Goliath, he secretly filled Goliath in on Mace's plan and left a hotel key for Goliath to escape.  Mace, however, lost his key in the confusion and became trapped in the hotel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 28 Revelations\"/>\n\n====Mr. Duval====\n'''Mr. Duval''' is first mentioned in the ''Gargoyle: The Goliath Chronicles'' episode \"The Journey\" (adapted into the first two issues of the SLG comic series).  Duval tried to call Xanatos, but Xanatos shows no interest in receiving the call.  Hacker tells Xanatos that the call was an invitation to the White House for an Illuminati assignment.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\nFor unspecified reasons, Duval's left eye and arm are replaced with cybernetic attachments, and he has an unexplained disdain for Blanchefleur.  He is also very important to Peredur.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Duval does not appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Eddie Marsan]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=11829\n| page = 11829\n| title = Ask Greg Weisman, co-creator of Gargoyles!\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| date = August 24, 2009\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Shari====\n'''Shari''' is a teenage girl introduced in the ''[[Gargoyles (SLG comic)]]'' comics series.  She appeared as a new resident of The Labyrinth, and was introduced to the Mutates and Clones.  After Thailog came to reclaim the clones, Shari left to warn Goliath, but was lying.  Her name was revealed as she arrived at Nightstone Unlimited, applying to be Thailog's executive assistant. Before Thailog attacked her, however, he spotted an Illuminati pendant around her neck and welcomed her as a member of the Illuminati\u2014which he had recently joined as a lower-echelon member.\n\nThailog soon demanded a story from Shari, and so she told him of a lost tale from The Avalon World Tour.  How she learned of that adventure was not specified.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/>\n\nShari went on to relate the legend of the Stone of Destiny to Thailog. She appeared to be more than she seemed.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\n====Quincy Hemings====\n'''Quincy Hemings''' made his first appearance in the SLG comic. He is a Chief Steward at the [[White House]].  Xanatos meets him at the White House, and mistakes him for Duval due to their shared rank number.  Hemings mentioned being on staff since the administration of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and being in his current position since the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration.  He gave Xanatos an assignment from The Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 1\"/> The assignment required Xanatos to retrieve the Stone Of Destiny.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Clan Building Volume 2\"/>\n\nWhile Hemings doesn't appear onscreen, Greg Weisman envisioned the voice of the character to be [[Morgan Freeman]].<ref name=\"greg 11829\" />\n\n====Falstaff====\n'''Falstaff''' (went by the name '''John Oldcastle''') was a father figure to Dingo, but for reasons unknown, strangled Dingo's mother.  Upon the arrival of The Redemption Squad at his island base (which is really a ship), Falstaff insisted that The Illuminati are the good guys, determined to save the world, and allowed The Redemption Squad to speak to Fiona Canmore and Thailog, so they can vouch for the Illuminati.  The Redemption Squad claimed to want membership, but Falstaff was aware of their bluff and sent his associates to fight the Squad.  After the fight, he departed, but not before sinking the ship.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n=====Falstaff's associates=====\n;Bardolf\n:Breathes fire.\n;Pistol\n:Gun fighter.\n;Points\n:Swordsman.\n;Mistress Doll\n:Contortionist.\n;Mistress Quickly\n:She is the only one apprehended by The Redemption Squad.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>\n\n====Fiona Canmore====\n'''Fiona Canmore''' is a former Hunter who ran into Demona in Paris in 1920.  She stopped her plans to kill all the humans with the aid of Team Atlantis.<ref name=\"Team Atlantis - The Last\"/>  As of 1996, she was retired from the hunt and was part of the Illuminati.<ref name=\"Gargoyles Bad Guys Volume 1\"/>  In the ''Team Atlantis'' episode (which, while unproduced, was scripted and voice-recorded), she was voiced by Sheena Easton.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=188\n| title = Search Ask Greg: Gathering 2002 Ramble: Saturday\n| date = July 10, 2002\n| last = Weisman\n| first = Greg\n| work = Gargoyles Fan Web Site\n| publisher = Station Eight\n| accessdate = September 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Known members and ranking====\nThe following characters are part of the Illuminati at the following ranks:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The company was seemingly at the forefront of advanced technology such as genetics, robotics, and weaponry. Xanatos Enterprises also included Gen-U-Tech, Pack Media Studios, and the Scarab Robotics corporation, all of which Xanatos used against the gargoyles and to further his goals one way or another.\n\n====David Xanatos====\n{{Main|David Xanatos}}\n'''David Xanatos''' is a billionaire, nemesis, and later ally of the gargoyles, Xanatos' name is reminiscent of [[David]]\u2014the Biblical king who defeated Goliath\u2014and [[Thanatos]] from Greek mythology. He broke the spell that imprisoned the gargoyles, and frequently attempted to manipulate or control them.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/> He was voiced by [[Jonathan Frakes]].\n\n====Owen Burnett====\n'''Owen Burnett''' was Xanatos' aide who is later revealed to be the immortal trickster [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]. Puck took on an appearance similar to that of Preston Vogel, Halcyon Renard's personal aid; he decides to \"out-Vogel Vogel\".<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> When Xanatos deduced his identity, Puck offered him the choice of receiving either the immortality he craved or a lifetime of Puck's service as Owen; to Puck's surprise, Xanatos chose the latter, confident that he would obtain immortality through other means and thus have Owen's services for eternity. For his part, Puck kept to the bargain in part for the novelty of assisting such an unorthodox mortal trickster; as he explained, \"\"The Puck has played many roles, but never that of [[straight man]].\"  The Owen persona eventually got his left hand turned to stone (the result of a spell gone wrong), and per Oberon's order, lost his magic powers except when he was training or protecting Alexander Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> He was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n====Anton Sevarius====\n'''Anton Sevarius''' was a [[free agent]] [[geneticist]] who mostly worked for the villains of the series, from David Xanatos to Demona. Known for his hammy play on the \"[[mad scientist]]\" stereotype, Sevarius was brilliant, but also devious and immoral. His experiments led to the creation of the [[Mutate (Gargoyles)|Mutates]]<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 15 Metamorphosis\"/> and Goliath's evil clone [[Thailog]] (whom he also worked for at one point), as well as Thailog's gargoyle clones. He also helped Demona create a virus capable of destroying all human life on Earth (how he hoped to survive her plan is unknown, although he probably had anti-virus prepared for himself). In his final appearance, Sevarius used the DNA of all the Manhattan clan to create a giant gargoyle named Little Anton in order to destroy Goliath and his friends; however, it ended up petrified by the virus just like the Clone clan was suffering from. Little Anton's \"death\" was the only time Sevarius showed any concern for someone. He was voiced by [[Tim Curry]].<ref>{{Cite news\n| url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1927272,00.html\n| title = The Guardian profile: Tim Curry\n| accessdate= 2008-03-26\n| first = Mark\n| last = Brown\n| date = 2006-10-20\n| newspaper = The Guardian\n| publisher = Guardian News and Media\n| quote = And to understand why he has done dozens of cartoon voices (he is Dr Doom in Fantastic Four and Dr Anton Sevarius in Gargoyles) you need to travel to the city he adopted as home in the 80s, Los Angeles.}}</ref>\n\n===Cyberbiotics Corporation===\n'''Cyberbiotics Corporation''' was a rival in all ways to Xanatos Enterprises, led by Halcyon Renard and Preston Vogel. Xanatos attempted several times to bankrupt Cyberbiotics, even using Renard's estranged daughter Fox to do so.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> Cyberbiotics was based both from a skyscraper on a fictional island in New York Harbor known as the \"Cyberbiotics Tower\", and from either of two successive, massive, somewhat [[helicarrier]]-like [[airship]]s named the \"Fortress\", sometimes accompanied by or supplanted with (for smaller missions) any one of a number of smaller \"hoverships\". The first of these massive \"Fortress\" airships was inadvertently destroyed by the Manhattan Clan.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 1-5 Awakening, Part 1-5\"/>\n\n====Halcyon Renard====\n'''Halcyon Renard''' was an elderly businessman who is [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Cyberbiotics, father of Fox, ex-husband to Anastasia, and rival to David Xanatos. He is confined to a powered reclining version of a wheelchair for unknown reasons; the chair is weaponized for his self-defense needs, along with other devices. After confronting Goliath about his role in destroying his first airship, he formed a friendship with the Manhattan Clan's leader after the pair worked together to save the second airship. It's suggested in \"The Cage\", that Halcyon lent a lab to Goliath so Dr. Sevarius could create a cure for the Labyrinth Clan. Halcyon's family name, ''renard'', is the French word for fox. Like Xanatos, he briefly flirted with immortality \u2014 with Renard's method being different, as he intended to transfer his own consciousness into a [[Golem#The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague|golem]], the legendary protector of the Ashkenazim living in [[Prague]] during Renaissance times, and still in existence in the late 20th century within the ''Gargoyles'' storyline. This form of what turned out to be a selfishly-acquired form of \"immortality\" did not go well for Renard, until Goliath managed to change Halcyon's mind for the better, convincing him to leave the Golem's lithic body behind. Unlike Xanatos, Halcyon was more conscientious of his actions, adhering strongly to his own well-developed ideals of personal [[integrity]] and near-complete [[sincerity]] for both himself, his firm's employees and others he had contact with. Indeed, one of the things that help the elderly man and the Manhattan Clan's leader bond and become friends is that Renard challenged Goliath to accept responsibility for his part in destroying the first airship. Goliath apparently grew to respect the older man because of his strong adherence to his own morals. It is worth noting that Renard and his assistant, Preston Vogel participated in a desperate attempt to stop Oberon from abducting his grandson, Alexander and taking the child to Avalon. When Vogel gently challenged his employer as to his reasons; noting that Renard hated his son in law and didn't trust his own daughter due to her lack of morals; Renard answered frankly, that he was doing it for his grandson and no one else. He was far less Machiavellian and malevolent than Xanatos.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> He was voiced by [[Robert Culp]].\n\n====Preston Vogel====\n'''Preston Vogel''' was Renard's aide who was considered by Puck to be the most \"wooden man on the earth.\" Puck modeled his mortal form after Vogel.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 57-58 The Gathering, Part 1-2\"/> Unlike Owen Burnett, Vogel was not as loyal to his boss, and had fewer scruples when it came to the means he used to get things done, such as hiring members of The Pack, Jackal, and Hyena; levelling a rainforest and killing a sizable number of the Guatemala Clan's gargoyles in 1993;<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 51 The Green\"/> or betraying Renard.<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 27 Outfoxed\"/> Voiced by [[Peter Scolari]].\n\n===Gargoyles Task Force===\nThe '''Gargoyles Task Force''' was formed during Part 3 of ''Hunter's Moon'' to find and counter or capture the gargoyles.  They followed the gargoyles to St. Damien's Cathedral.  Due to Matt's surreptitious stalling, in hopes the clan could escape, they were unable to apprehend the clan.

She deduced Demona's human identity, and shot The Clocktower hoping to kill Goliath and Clan.  Though she saw the light after Jason's atonement,<ref name=\"Gargoyles episode 63-65 Hunter's Moon, Part 1-3\"/> Robyn was maintaining her identity as '''The Hunter''' while serving The Director.

However, the machines became sentient and threatened to overrun the planet (an allusion to the so-called [[grey goo]] scenario in speculative science fiction). With the help of a local [[shaman]], Goliath and Dingo convinced the nanomachines to form a humanoid shape that merged with Dingo's armor suit.

She stated that he would have a chance for atonement, and that refusing to join would expose his clan to the world.

He was later visited by Sevarius, who infiltrated the labyrinth to obtain some test subjects.
