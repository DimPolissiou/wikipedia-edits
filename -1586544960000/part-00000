The political change on the part of the Qing court was due in large part to the emperor's awareness and perception of threat from political factions that were forming for the purpose of influencing the imperial succession.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pang |first1=Pu |authorlink=\u9f90\u6a38 |title=Zhongguo Ruxue \u4e2d\u570b\u5112\u5b78 |page=223 |language=Chinese |location=Shanghai |publisher=Dongfang Chuban Zhongxin |edition=1997 |volume=2 }}</ref> Fang was arrested by the Governor of [[Suzhou]], his friend [[Zhang Boxing]].

There were no such windows for the other four rooms and yet more than two hundred prisoners were always confined there. Each day toward dusk, the cells were locked and the odor of the urine and excrement would mingle with that of the food and drink. Moreover, in the coldest months of the winter, the poor prisoners had to sleep on the ground and when the spring breezes came everyone got sick. The established rule in the prison was that the door would be unlocked only at dawn. During the night, the living and the dead slept side by side with no room to turn their bodies and this is why so many people became infected. ... Among three of my cellmates who were beaten with clubs, one paid thirty taels [i.e. ounces of silver] and his bones were only slightly damaged and he was sick for two months; another paid double and his skin was hurt but he recovered in twenty days; the third paid five times more and was able to walk as usual that very night.

As a result of a political realignment, the work had been judged seditious by the court of the Kangxi Emperor, who previously promoted scholarly officials.

The [[Jews|Jewry]] of [[Pamplona]] and [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] were massacred. Two decades later the impact of the [[Black Death]] of 1348 provoked assaults on the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|juder\u00edas]] of several places, especially those of Barcelona and other places in the Principality of Catalonia. In the [[Crown of Castile]] anti-Jewish violence was closely related to the civil war, during the reign of [[Peter of Castile|Pedro I,]] in which the side that supported [[Henry II of Castile|Enrique de Trast\u00e1mara]] used anti-Judaism as a propaganda weapon, and the pretender accused his stepbrother, King Peter, of favoring the Jews. The first slaughter of Jews, in Toledo in 1355, was carried out by the supporters of Enrique de Trast\u00e1mara when they entered the city. The same happened eleven years later when they occupied [[Briviesca]]. In [[Burgos]], Jews who could not pay the large tribute imposed on them,  were enslaved and sold in 1366. In 1367 in [[Valladolid]] Jews were assaulted to the shout of \"Long live King Henry!\". There were no deaths, but the synagogues were burned down.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 13-15|quote=The civil war has changed the situation of the Jews in the crown of Castile.

The assaults, the fires, the looting and the massacres began in June, in Seville, where [[Ferrand Martinez]], archdeacon of \u00c9cija, took advantage of the power vacuum created by the death of the archbishop of Seville. Hardened  by his preaching against the Jews, which had begun in 1378, he ordered the overthrow of the synagogues and requisitioning of prayer books. In January 1391, a first attempt of assault on the Jewish quarter was avoided by the municipal authorities. However, in June 1391, hundreds of Jews were murdered, their houses ransacked, and the synagogues converted into churches. Some Jews managed to escape; others, terrified, asked to be baptized.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|p=15}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nFrom Seville, anti-Jewish violence extended throughout Andalusia, and then towards Castile. In August it reached the Crown of Aragon. Murders, looting and fires took place everywhere. Many of the Jews who survived fled, many to the kingdoms of Navarre and Portugal, France, and North Africa. Others chose baptism to avoid death. The number of victims is difficult to know. About 400 Jews were murdered in Barcelona; in Valencia 250; In L\u00e9rida 68 ... <ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez |2012|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nAfter the massacres of 1391, anti-Jewish measures were intensified. In 1411, Castile ordered that Jews wear a red badge sewn onto their clothing. In the Crown of Aragon the possession of the [[Talmud]] was declared unlawful, and the number of synagogues per aljama was limited to one. In addition, the mendicant orders, with the support of the monarchs, intensified their campaign of proselytism, in which Valencian [[Vincent Ferrer]] played a prominent part, to convert Jews to Christianity. It was also decreed that Jews were obliged to attend three sermons every year. As a result of the massacres of 1391 and the measures that followed, by 1415, more than half of the Jews of Castile and Aragon had renounced the Mosaic law and had been baptized, including many [[rabbi]]s and important members of the community.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Jews in the fifteenth century ===\n[[File:Spanishhaggadah.jpg|thumb|Miniature of a Spanish [[haggadah]] of the fourteenth century]]\n\nAfter the massacres of 1391 and the preaching that followed them, by 1415 scarcely a hundred thousand Jews continued to practice their religion in the crowns of Castile and Aragon. Joseph Perez said, \"Spanish Judaism will never recover from this catastrophe.\" The Jewish community \"came out of the crisis not only physically diminished but morally and intellectually shattered\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=138}}</ref>\n\nIn the Crown of Aragon, Judaism virtually disappeared in important places such as Barcelona, Valencia and Palma\u2014in 1424 the Barcelona Jewry was abolished because it was considered unnecessary\u2014<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=19}}</ref> and only the Zaragoza one remained. In Castile aljamas once flourishing such as those of Seville, Toledo or Burgos lost much of their members; in 1492, the year of the expulsion, in the Crown of Aragon only a quarter of the former number of Jews remained. The famous Jewish community of [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]], for example, was left with only 24 families. In the Crown of Castile not 80,000 were left. In Seville before the revolts of 1391 there were about 500 Jewish families. According to Joseph Perez, at the time of the expulsion there were fewer than 150,000 Jews, distributed in 35 aljamas of the Crown of Aragon and 216 in the Crown of Castile. In both Crowns it was observed that the Jews had left the great cities and lived in the small and the rural areas, less exposed \"to the excesses of the Christians.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp. 138; 164-165}}</ref>\n[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish celebrating [[Havdalah|havdal\u00e1]], detail of miniature of the century XIV.]]\n\nAfter the critical period of 1391-1415, the pressure on Jews recovering their synagogues and books confiscated decreased, and they became able to avoid certain obligations such as carrying the red ribbon or attending friars' sermons. They could also reconstruct the internal organization of the aljamas and their religious activities, thanks to the agreements reached by the procurators of the aljamas gathered in Valladolid in 1432 and sanctioned by the king, which means that \"the Crown of Castile accepts again officially that a minority of its subjects has another religion than the Christian one and recognizes the right of this minority to exist legally, with a legal status.\" \"In this way the Jewish community is rebuilt with the approval of the crown.\" Abraham Beneviste, who presided over the meeting of Valladolid, was appointed court rabbi with authority over all the Jews of the kingdom, and at the same time as delegate of the king over them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=139-140}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, in the last quarter of the 15th century, many Jews lived in rural villages and engaged in agricultural activities. Crafts and trade were not monopolized\u2014international trade had passed into the hands of converts. While Jews continued to trade as [[money-lender]]s, the number of Christian lenders had increased a lot. Jews also continued to collect royal, ecclesiastical and seigniorial rents, but their importance had also diminished\u2014in Castile they were only in charge of a quarter of the revenues. However, in the court of Castile\u2014but not Aragon\u2014Jews held important administrative and financial positions. [[Abraham Senior]] was from 1488 treasurer-major of the Holy Brotherhood, a key organism in the financing of the [[Granada War|war of Grenada]], and also chief rabbi of Castile. Yuc\u00e9 Abravanel was \"A greater collector of the service and mountaineering of the herds, one of the more healthy income and greater yield of the Crown of Castile.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=165-167}}</ref> However, according to Joseph Perez, the role of the Jews in the court must not be exaggerated. \"The truth was that the state could do without the Jews, both in the bureaucratic apparatus and in the management of the estate.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=168}}</ref>\n[[File:IsabellaofCastile03.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]]]]\n\nWe must therefore reject the claim that the Hebrew community at the end of the fifteenth century was immensely rich and influential. \"In fact, the Spanish Jews at the time of their expulsion did not form a homogeneous social group. There were among them classes as in Christian society, a small minority of very rich and well-placed men, together with a mass of small people: Farmers, artisans, shopkeepers.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=168}}</ref> What united them was that they practiced the same faith, different from the one recognized, which made them a separate community within the monarchy and which was \"property\" of the crown which thereby protected them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=168-169}}</ref> In a letter dated 7 July, 1477, addressed to the authorities of [[Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres|Trujillo]], where incidents had occurred against the Jews, Queen Isabella I of Castile, after putting the aljama under her protection and prohibiting all type of oppression or humiliation against its members, states:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=174}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|All the Jews of my kingdoms are mine and are under my protection, and it is for me to defend and protect them and to keep them in justice.}}\n\nThus, the Jews \"formed not a State in the State, but rather a micro-society next to the majority Christian society, with an authority [the rabbi greater] that the crown delegated to him over its members.\" The aljamas were organized internally with a wide margin of autonomy. They designated by lottery the council of elders that governed the life of the community; collecting their own taxes for the maintenance of worship, synagogues, and rabbinical teaching; lived under the norms of Jewish law, and had their own courts that understood all cases in civil matters - from the Cortes de Madrigal of 1476 criminal cases had passed to the royal courts. But Jews did not enjoy the fullness of civil rights: they had a specific tax system far more burdensome than that of Christians and were excluded from positions that could confer authority on Christians.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=169-170}}</ref>\n\nThe situation in which the Jews lived, according to Joseph Perez, posed two problems: \"as subjects and vassals of the king, the Jews had no guarantee for the future - the monarch could at any time close the autonomy of the aljamas or require new Most important taxes-\"; and, above all, \"in these late years of the Middle Ages, when a state of modern character is being developed, there could be no question of a problem of immense importance: was the existence of separate and autonomous communities compatible with the demands of A modern state? This was the real question.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp=170-171}}</ref>\n\n=== The Conversos and the Inquisition ===\n[[File:Tajador judeo-espa\u00f1ol s.XIV.jpg|thumb|Judeo-Spanish dish of century XIV]]\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the main problem stopped being the Jews to become conversos, who according to Henry Kamen probably numbered around three hundred thousand people.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Christian convert was applied to the Jews who had been [[Baptism|baptized]] and their descendants. As many of them had been forcibly converted, they were often looked upon with distrust by those who considered themselves [[Old Christian|Old Christians]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 17-18}}</ref>\nIn the fifteenth century the positions abandoned by Jews were mostly filled by converts, who congregated where Jewish communities had flourished before 1391, doing work formerly performed by Jews - trade and crafts - with the added advantage that as Christians they could now access trades and professions previously forbidden to Jews. Some even entered the clergy, becoming [[Biblical canon|canon]]s, [[prior]]s<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 19-20}}</ref> and even bishops.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p = 35}}</ref>\n\nThe socio-economic position of converts was viewed with suspicion by the \"old\" Christians, a resentment that was accentuated by the conscience on the part of those who had a differentiated identity, proud of being Christians and having Jewish ancestry, which was the lineage of Christ. Popular revolts broke out against the converts between 1449 and 1474, a period in Castile of economic difficulties and political crisis (especially during the civil war of the reign of Henry IV). The first and largest of these revolts took place in 1449 in Toledo, during which a \"Judgment-Statute\" was approved that prohibited the access to the municipal positions of \"no confesso of the lineage of the Jews\" - an antecedent of the following blood-cleaning statutes of the following century. The origin of the revolts was economic in Andalusia especially there was a situation of hunger, aggravated by an epidemic of plague - and in principle \"not directed especially against the converts.\" It is the parties and the demagogues that take advantage of the exasperation of the people and direct it against the converts.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 20-21| ps = \"The rich are hated because they are safe from hunger and disease; traders are accused of storing wheat to cause prices to rise; the houses of one and the other are looted.\"}}</ref>\n[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Cuadro ''[[La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos|Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' in which appears kneeling behind the king Ferdinand the Catholic, the inquisitor general [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]] and kneeling behind the queen the inquisitor of Aragon [[Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s|Pedro of Arbu\u00e9s]]]]\n\nTo justify the attacks on converts, they affirmed that ''conversos'' were false Christians and that they still practiced the Jewish religion in secret. According to Joseph Perez, it is a proven fact that, among those who converted to escape the blind furor of the masses in 1391, or by the pressure of the proselytizing campaigns of the early fifteenth century, some clandestinely returned to their old faith when it seemed that the danger had passed, of which it is said that ''Juda\u00edzan.'' The accusation of [[Crypto-Judaism]] becomes more plausible when some cases of prominent converts who continued to observe the Jewish rites after their conversion. But Joseph Judaizers, according to Joseph Perez, were a minority, although relatively important. He also affirms [[Henry Kamen]] when he says that \"it can be affirmed that in the end of the 1470\u2019s there was no Judaizing movement highlighted or proven among the converts.\" He also points out that when a convert was accused of judaizing, in many cases the \"proofs\" that were brought were in fact cultural elements of his Jewish ancestry - such as the Sabbath, not Sunday, as the day of rest - or the lack of knowledge of the new faith - such as not knowing the creed or eating meat in Lent - <ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 44-46|ps = \"Anyone who does not adapt to the rest of the community will be I saw as \"Jew.\"{{what|date=September 2019}} Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, alchemist of Soria in the 1470\u2019s, disdained the official religion, but the parish priest described him as \"the wisest men in the world in all things.\" Precisely for this reason he was reputed, according to the testimony of an official, to be \"Jewish\"}}</ref>\n\nThis is how the \"convergent problem\" is born. The baptized can not renounce their faith according to the canonical doctrine of the Church by which [[Crypto-Judaism]] is assimilated to [[heresy]], and as such must be punished. This is how they begin to claim various voices including those of some converts who do not want to question the sincerity of their baptism because of those \"false\" Christians who are beginning to be called [[Marrano]]. And it also extends the idea that the presence of the Jews among the Christians is what invites the converts to continue practicing the [[Law of Moses]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 24-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Isabel I of Castile]] ascended to the throne in 1474, she was already married to the heir to the [[Crown of Aragon]], the future [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. At this time, there was no punishment for practicing [[crypto-Judaism]], not out of tolerance for Jews, but for legalistic reasons.{{efn|'''[[Crypto-Judaism]] was not punished:''' \"Certainly not because of tolerance or indifference, but because they lacked the appropriate legal instruments in order to define it as a crime.\" <small>''\"No, por cierto, por tolerancia o indiferencia, sino porque se carec\u00eda de instrumentos jur\u00eddicos apropiados para caracterizar este tipo de delito.{{thin space}}\"''</small><ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>}}\nThey decided to confront the \"[[converso]] problem\", especially after having received some alarming reports in 1475 by the Prior of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] of Seville, Friar Alonso de Ojeda{{efn|'''Friar Alonso De Ojeda:''' this is not [[Alonso de Ojeda]], Spanish navigator and conquistador, but a close relative of his with the same name.}} who reported that there were a large number of ''conversos'' in that city secretly practicing their religion in private, some even doing so openly.\nAfter receiving these reports, they applied to Pope [[Sixtus IV]] for authorization to name a number of [[inquisitors]] in their kingdom, which the pontiff agreed to in his [[papal bull|bull]] ''[[Exigit sincerae devotionis]]'' of {{date|1 November 1478}}.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|p=25}}</ref>\n\"With the creation of the Tribunal of the Inquisition{{efn|'''Tribunal of the Inquisition:''' officially, \"[[Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition]]\" ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisici\u00f3n|links=no}}) normally known in English as the [[Spanish Inquisition]].}}, the authorities will have sufficient instruments and methods of investigation at their disposal.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=171}}</ref>\nAccording to Joseph P\u00e9rez, Ferdinand and Isabella \"were convinced that the Inquisition would force the ''conversos'' to assimilate into society once and for all: the day when all of the new Christians would renounce Judaism, nothing would distinguish them anymore from any other member of society.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n== Expulsion ==\n\n=== Segregation of the Jews (1480) ===\n[[File:IsabellaofCastile05.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando II of Aragon]].]]\n\nFrom the beginning of their reign, [[Catholic Monarchs|Isabel and Ferdinand]] were concerned with protecting Jews - since they were \"property\" of the crown. For example, on September 6, 1477, in a letter addressed to the Jewish community of Seville, Queen Isabel I gave assurances about their safety:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 21-22}}</ref>{{what|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote| I take under my protection the Jews of the [[aljama]]s in general and to each one in particular, as well as to his people and their goods; I protect them against any attack, be it of the nature that is ...; I forbid that they attack, mate or hiera; I also prohibit a passive attitude if attacked, killed or injured.\nHence even the Catholic Kings until 1492 were reputed to be favorable to the Jews. This is what the German traveler, Nicolas de Popielovo says, for example, after his visit in 1484-1485:<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 175}}}</ref>\nHis subjects of Catalonia and Aragon speak publicly and the same things I have heard say to many in Spain that the Queen is protector of the Jews and daughter of a Jewish woman}}\nBut they could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at usurious interest, etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live in separate quarters, where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith. A process for which a term of two years was established, but which lasted for more than ten years, and which was not exempt from problems and abuses by Christians.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp = 176-178}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SegoviaPSAndres 21-4-03.JPG|thumb|left|Lowered to the Gate of San Andr\u00e9s, in the Juder\u00eda of Segovia]]\nThe text approved by the Cortes, which also included the [[Mud\u00e9jar|Mudejar]], read as follows:<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p = 92}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|We send to the aljamas of the said Jews and Moors that each of them who put in said apartment such diligence and give such order as within the said term of the said two years have said houses of their apart, and live and die in them, and henceforth do not have their dwellings among the Christians or elsewhere outside the circuits and places that would be deputies to the said Jewry and die.}}\nThe decision of the kings approved by the Courts of Toledo, had antecedents since the Jews already had been confined in some Castilian localities like C\u00e1ceres or Soria. In this last locality had been realized with the approval of the kings \"to avoid dapnos [sic] that because of bevir and to dwell and to be the Jews among the christianos they followed\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p=92}}</ref> Fray Hernando de Talavera, confessor of the queen and who had opposed the use of force to solve the \"convergent problem\", also justified the segregation \"by avoiding many sins, which are followed of the mixture and a great deal of familiarity [between Christians and Jews] and of not keeping everything close to their conversation with Christians by [[Canon law|holy canons]] and civil laws is ordered and commanded.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p=94}}</ref>\n\nWith the decision to detain Jews in ghettos, it was not only a question of separating them from Christians and of protecting them, but also of imposing a series of obstacles to their activities, so that they would have no choice but \"to give up their status as Jews if they want to lead a normal existence.

In the first years in this city alone they pronounced 700 death sentences and more than five thousand \"reconciliations\" - that is, prison sentences, exile or simple penances - accompanied by confiscation of their property and disqualification or public office and ecclesiastical benefits.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=181}}</ref>\n\nIn their inquiries the inquisitors discovered that for a long time many converts had met with their Jewish relatives to celebrate Jewish holidays and even attend synagogues.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=171-172}}</ref> This convinced them that they would not be able to put an end to crypto-Judaism if converts continued to maintain contact with the Jews, so they asked the kings for the Jews to be expelled from Andalusia. This request was approved and in 1483, the kings gave a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the ports of the Crown of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=182}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Julio Valde\u00f3n, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia also obeyed \"the desire to move them away from the border between the crown of Castile and the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], scenario, during the eighties of the fifteenth century and the first years of the 1490s, of the war that ended with the disappearance of the last stronghold of peninsular Islam.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p = 93}}</ref>\n\n=== The genesis of the expulsion decree ===\n{{main|Alhambra Decree}}\n[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|thumb|225px|Sealed copy of the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]].]]\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n_de_los_jud\u00edos.jpg|thumb|225px|The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (in the year 1492) by [[Emilio Sala (painter)|Emilio Sala Franc\u00e9s]]]]\n\nOn March 31, 1492, shortly after the end of the Granada war, the Catholic Monarchs signed the decree of expulsion of the Jews in Granada, which was sent to all the cities, towns and lordships of their kingdoms with strict orders to not read it or make it public until May 1.<ref name = \"Rumeu\">{{cite book| last= Rumeu de Armas | first = Antonio | title = New light on the Santa Fe capitulations of 1492 between the Catholic Monarchs and Christopher Columbus: institutional and diplomatic study | page = 138-141 | editor = Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas | isbn = 9788400059613}}</ref> It is possible that some prominent Jews tried to nullify or soften it but did not have any success. Among these Jews stands out [[Isaac Abarbanel|Isaac Abravanel]], who offered King Ferdinand a considerable sum of money. According to a well-known legend when Inquisitor General [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]] discovered this, he presented himself before the king and threw a crucifix at his feet, saying: \"Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver; His Majesty is about to sell it again for thirty thousand.\" According to the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu, quoted by Julio Valde\u00f3n, when Abravanel met with the Queen Isabella, she said to him: \"'Do you think this comes from me?

Torquemada presented the draft decree to the monarchs on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada \"demonstrates the leading role of [the Inquisition] in that matter.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez | 2009 | p = 187}}</ref>\n\nOf the decree promulgated in Granada on March 31, which was based on the draft decree of Torquemada - drawn up \"with the will and consent of their altezas\" and which is dated in Santa Fe On March 20 - there are two versions: One signed by the two monarchs and valid for the Crown of Castile and another signed only by King Ferdinand and valid for the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Between the draft decree of Torquemada and the two final versions and between these, they exist, according to Joseph Perez, \"significant variants.\" In contrast to the Torquemada project and the Castilian decree, in the version addressed to the Crown of Aragon the protagonism of the Inquisition is recognized - \" Persuading us the venerable father prior of Santa Cruz [Torquemada], inquisitor general of the heretical staidness usury is mentioned as one of the two crimes of which the Jews are accused: \"We find the Jewish sayings, by means of great and unbearable usages, to devour and absorb the properties and substances of Christians\"; We reaffirm the official position that only the Crown can decide the fate of the Jews since they are the possession of the kings - \"they are ours,\" it is said; And contains more insulting expressions against the Jews: they are accused of making fun of the laws of Christians and of considering them [[idolatry|idolaters]]; Mention is made of the abominable circumstances and of Jewish perfidy. The Judaism of \"leprosy\" is qualified; It is recalled that the Jews \"by their own fault are subject to perpetual servitude, to be slaves and captives.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez | 2009 | pp. 187-188}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the essentials the two versions have the same structure and expose the same ideas. The first part describes the reasons why the monarchs - or the king in the case of the Aragonese version - decided to expel the Jews. The second part detailed how the expulsion would take place.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 188}}</ref>\n\n=== The conditions of expulsion ===\nThe second part of the decree detailed the conditions for expulsion:<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=189}}</ref>\n# The expulsion of the Jews was final: \"we agreed to send all Jews and Jews out of our kingdoms and never return or return to them or any of them.\"\n# There was no exception, neither by reason of age, residence or place of birth - it included both those born in Castile and Aragon and those from outside.\n# There was a period of four months, which would be extended ten more days, until August 10, to leave the kings' domains. Those who did not do so within that period or who returned later would be punished with the death penalty and the confiscation of their property. Likewise, those who aided or concealed the Jews were liable to lose \"all their goods, vassals, and fortresses, and other inheritances.\"\n# Within the set period of four months the Jews could sell their real estate and take the proceeds of the sale in the form of bills of exchange, not in coinage or gold and silver because their exit was prohibited by law - or merchandise - as long as they were not arms or horses, whose export was also prohibited.\n\nAlthough the edict did not refer to a possible conversion, this alternative was implicit. As the historian [[Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] pointed out, the Jews had \"four months to take the most terrible decision of their lives: to abandon their faith to be integrated in it [in the kingdom, in the political and civil community], or leave the territory in order to preserve it.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez|2012|p=415}}</ref>\n\nThe drama that the Jews lived is documented by a contemporary source:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=112}}</ref>\n{{quote|Some Jews, when the term ended, went by night and day as in despair.

The most relevant case was that of [[Abraham Senior]], the chief rabbi of Castile and one of the closest collaborators of the monarchs. He and all his relatives were baptized on June 15, 1492 in the Guadalupe monastery, being his godfathers the kings Isabel and Fernando. He took the name of Fern\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez Coronel and his son-in-law Mayr Melamed, Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Coronel - the same name of pile that the one of the king. In this case, like that of Abraham de C\u00f3rdoba, he was given much publicity to serve as an example for the rest of his community.

Nowadays, some of those who argued at the time, such as the expulsion of the Jews to stay with their wealth, seem to have been discarded, since the majority of the Jews who left were the most modest, while the richest converted and they stayed, and on the other hand, the crown did not benefit at all from the operation - rather it was damaged because it stopped receiving the taxes paid by the Jews. Nor does the argument seem to hold that the expulsion was an episode of classes - the nobility wanted to get rid of an incipient bourgeoisie that represented the Jews and that supposedly threatened their interests - because many Jews were defended by some of the most important nobiliary families of Castile, and because he was also among the ranks of the \"bourgeoisie\" of \"old Christians\" where anti-Judaism grew the most.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|pp=99-100}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=117-118; 120-}}</ref>\n\nThe personal motives of the kings also seem to be ruled out, because everything indicates that they did not feel any repugnance towards Jews and converts. Among the trusted men of the kings were several who belonged to this group, such as the confessor of the queen [[Hernando de Talavera|fray Hernando de Talavera]], the steward [[Andr\u00e9s Cabrera]], the treasurer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] [[Abraham Senior]], or as Mayr Melamed or [[Isaac Abarbanel]], without counting the Jewish doctors that attended them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=124-125}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n jud\u00edos.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsion of European Jewish communities between 1100 and 1600.

[...] it was the so-called medieval coexistence that missed Christian Europe.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=136-137}}</ref>\n\nJulio Valde\u00f3n affirms that the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, who \"showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews,\" was due to \"pressure from the rest of Christianity\" and to \"the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called \"deicides\", as well as the \"tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community.\" In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian [[Benzion Netanyahu]] that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p=101}}</ref> A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. \"Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?\" Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term \"usury\", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, ritual crimes ... do not appear in any of the three versions.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=125-126}}</ref>\n\nFor Joseph Perez, the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, as evidenced by the content of the [[Alhambra Decree|Granada Edict]], is directly related to the \"converso problem\". The first step was the creation of the Inquisition, the second the expulsion of the Jews to eliminate those who allegedly incited the converts to Judaize. \"What concerned them [the kings] was the total and definitive assimilation of the converts, for which the previous measures failed; they resort to a drastic solution: the expulsion of the Jews to start evil.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=124}}</ref> \"The idea of expelling the Jews is part of the Inquisition, of which there is no doubt ... The Inquisition found the expulsion of the Jews the best way to put an end to the Judaizing converts: removed the Catholic Monarchs take the idea to their own account, but this does not mean that the pressure of the inquisitors is low. Heresy is not to their liking, they want to \"clean\" their kingdom, as the queen wrote, but these concerns are also political: they hope that the elimination of Judaism will facilitate the definitive assimilation and integration of converts into Spanish society\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=128-129}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Joseph Perez, following Luis Su\u00e1rez, places the expulsion within the context of the construction of the \"modern state,\" which requires greater social cohesion based on unity of faith to impose its authority on all groups and individuals of the kingdom. Unlike the medieval period in this type of state, it does not fit the groups that are governed by particular norms, as was the case of the Jewish community. It is therefore not a coincidence, P\u00e9rez warns, that only three months after having eliminated the last Muslim stronghold of the peninsula with the conquest of the Nazari kingdom of Granada, they decree the expulsion of the Jews. \"What was intended then was to completely assimilate Judaizers and Jews so that there would be no more than Christians. Kings must have thought that the prospect of expulsion would encourage Jews to become massively and that a gradual assimilation would do away with the remnants of Judaism\". \"They totally refused to assimilate as an alternative.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=129-132}}</ref> However, \"assimilation\" is in this quotation a euphemism: what was offered to the Sephardic was in fact the conversion to a faith that was not his own, hence his Emigration in mass (towards the different directions indicated in the attached map).\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n=== The end of religious diversity in Spain ===\n[[File:Monumentoalatolerancia.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to Tolerance]] in [[Seville]], located in the place where five Jews were burned alive.]]\n[[File:Sephardic family in Bosnia, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Sephardic family of Bosnia [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|ottoman Bosnia]] (19th century).]]\n\nAs Joseph Perez pointed out, \"In 1492 the story of Spanish Judaism ends, which will only lead to an underground existence, always threatened by the Spanish Inquisition and the suspicion of a public opinion that saw In Jews, Judaizers and even sincere converts to natural enemies of Catholicism and Spanish idiosyncrasy, as understood and imposed by some ecclesiastical and intellectual leaders, in an attitude that bordered on racism.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=117}}</ref>\n\nHistoric accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000.

The peninsular Christian kingdoms were by no means foreign to the growth of increasingly belligerent anti-Judaism\u2014in the Castilian code of [[Siete Partidas]] it was said that the Jews lived among Christians \"so that their presence would remind that they descended from those who crucified Our Lord Jesus Christ\"\u2014but the kings continued to \"protect\" the Jews for the important role they played in their kingdoms.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp=10-11|ps=\u00abLos jud\u00edos, perseguidos, hallaron refugio en los reinos cristianos del norte, donde fueron bien acogidos por los pr\u00edncipes porque proced\u00edan de un pa\u00eds \u2013[[Al-\u00c1ndalus]]- cuya civilizaci\u00f3n era por aquel entonces muy superior a la de la Espa\u00f1a cristiana, porque hablaban \u00e1rabe, porque conoc\u00edan la organizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, econ\u00f3mica y social de los territorios musulmanes y porque dominaban las t\u00e9cnicas comerciales m\u00e1s avanzadas\u00bb.}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourteenth century the period of \"tolerance\" towards the Jews was over, passing into a phase of increasing conflicts.

The good times of Spain of the three religions had coincided with a phase of territorial, demographic and economic expansion, Jews and Christians did not compete in the labor market: both one and the other contributed to the general prosperity and shared their benefits.

Of the fourteenth century, the wars and natural catastrophes that precede and follow the [[Black Plague]] create a new situation. ... [People] believe themselves to be the victim of a curse, punished for sins they would have committed. It invites the faithful to repent, to change their behavior and to return to God. This is when the presence of the \"deicidal people\" among Christians is considered scandalous.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp=12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== The Jewish massacres of 1391 and their consequences ===\n{{main|Massacre of 1391}}\nThe first wave of violence against the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula occurred in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] as a consequence of the arrival  of the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|crusade of the shepherds]] across the Pyren\u00e9es in 1321. The [[Jews|Jewry]] of [[Pamplona]] and [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] were massacred. Two decades later the impact of the [[Black Death]] of 1348 provoked assaults on the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|juder\u00edas]] of several places, especially those of Barcelona and other places in the Principality of Catalonia. In the [[Crown of Castile]] anti-Jewish violence was closely related to the civil war, during the reign of [[Peter of Castile|Pedro I,]] in which the side that supported [[Henry II of Castile|Enrique de Trast\u00e1mara]] used anti-Judaism as a propaganda weapon, and the pretender accused his stepbrother, King Peter, of favoring the Jews. The first slaughter of Jews, in Toledo in 1355, was carried out by the supporters of Enrique de Trast\u00e1mara when they entered the city. The same happened eleven years later when they occupied [[Briviesca]]. In [[Burgos]], Jews who could not pay the large tribute imposed on them,  were enslaved and sold in 1366. In 1367 in [[Valladolid]] Jews were assaulted to the shout of \"Long live King Henry!\". There were no deaths, but the synagogues were burned down.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 13-15|quote=The civil war has changed the situation of the Jews in the crown of Castile.

The assaults, the fires, the looting and the massacres began in June, in Seville, where [[Ferrand Martinez]], archdeacon of \u00c9cija, took advantage of the power vacuum created by the death of the archbishop of Seville. Hardened  by his preaching against the Jews, which had begun in 1378, he ordered the overthrow of the synagogues and requisitioning of prayer books. In January 1391, a first attempt of assault on the Jewish quarter was avoided by the municipal authorities. However, in June 1391, hundreds of Jews were murdered, their houses ransacked, and the synagogues converted into churches. Some Jews managed to escape; others, terrified, asked to be baptized.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|p=15}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nFrom Seville, anti-Jewish violence extended throughout Andalusia, and then towards Castile. In August it reached the Crown of Aragon. Murders, looting and fires took place everywhere. Many of the Jews who survived fled, many to the kingdoms of Navarre and Portugal, France, and North Africa. Others chose baptism to avoid death. The number of victims is difficult to know. About 400 Jews were murdered in Barcelona; in Valencia 250; In L\u00e9rida 68 ... <ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez |2012|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}</ref>\n\nAfter the massacres of 1391, anti-Jewish measures were intensified. In 1411, Castile ordered that Jews wear a red badge sewn onto their clothing. In the Crown of Aragon the possession of the [[Talmud]] was declared unlawful, and the number of synagogues per aljama was limited to one. In addition, the mendicant orders, with the support of the monarchs, intensified their campaign of proselytism, in which Valencian [[Vincent Ferrer]] played a prominent part, to convert Jews to Christianity. It was also decreed that Jews were obliged to attend three sermons every year. As a result of the massacres of 1391 and the measures that followed, by 1415, more than half of the Jews of Castile and Aragon had renounced the Mosaic law and had been baptized, including many [[rabbi]]s and important members of the community.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Jews in the fifteenth century ===\n[[File:Spanishhaggadah.jpg|thumb|Miniature of a Spanish [[haggadah]] of the fourteenth century]]\n\nAfter the massacres of 1391 and the preaching that followed them, by 1415 scarcely a hundred thousand Jews continued to practice their religion in the crowns of Castile and Aragon. Joseph Perez said, \"Spanish Judaism will never recover from this catastrophe.\" The Jewish community \"came out of the crisis not only physically diminished but morally and intellectually shattered\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=138}}</ref>\n\nIn the Crown of Aragon, Judaism virtually disappeared in important places such as Barcelona, Valencia and Palma\u2014in 1424 the Barcelona Jewry was abolished because it was considered unnecessary\u2014<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=19}}</ref> and only the Zaragoza one remained. In Castile aljamas once flourishing such as those of Seville, Toledo or Burgos lost much of their members; in 1492, the year of the expulsion, in the Crown of Aragon only a quarter of the former number of Jews remained. The famous Jewish community of [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]], for example, was left with only 24 families. In the Crown of Castile not 80,000 were left. In Seville before the revolts of 1391 there were about 500 Jewish families. According to Joseph Perez, at the time of the expulsion there were fewer than 150,000 Jews, distributed in 35 aljamas of the Crown of Aragon and 216 in the Crown of Castile. In both Crowns it was observed that the Jews had left the great cities and lived in the small and the rural areas, less exposed \"to the excesses of the Christians.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp. 138; 164-165}}</ref>\n[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish celebrating [[Havdalah|havdal\u00e1]], detail of miniature of the century XIV.]]\n\nAfter the critical period of 1391-1415, the pressure on Jews recovering their synagogues and books confiscated decreased, and they became able to avoid certain obligations such as carrying the red ribbon or attending friars' sermons. They could also reconstruct the internal organization of the aljamas and their religious activities, thanks to the agreements reached by the procurators of the aljamas gathered in Valladolid in 1432 and sanctioned by the king, which means that \"the Crown of Castile accepts again officially that a minority of its subjects has another religion than the Christian one and recognizes the right of this minority to exist legally, with a legal status.\" \"In this way the Jewish community is rebuilt with the approval of the crown.\" Abraham Beneviste, who presided over the meeting of Valladolid, was appointed court rabbi with authority over all the Jews of the kingdom, and at the same time as delegate of the king over them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=139-140}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, in the last quarter of the 15th century, many Jews lived in rural villages and engaged in agricultural activities. Crafts and trade were not monopolized\u2014international trade had passed into the hands of converts. While Jews continued to trade as [[money-lender]]s, the number of Christian lenders had increased a lot. Jews also continued to collect royal, ecclesiastical and seigniorial rents, but their importance had also diminished\u2014in Castile they were only in charge of a quarter of the revenues. However, in the court of Castile\u2014but not Aragon\u2014Jews held important administrative and financial positions. [[Abraham Senior]] was from 1488 treasurer-major of the Holy Brotherhood, a key organism in the financing of the [[Granada War|war of Grenada]], and also chief rabbi of Castile. Yuc\u00e9 Abravanel was \"A greater collector of the service and mountaineering of the herds, one of the more healthy income and greater yield of the Crown of Castile.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=165-167}}</ref> However, according to Joseph Perez, the role of the Jews in the court must not be exaggerated. \"The truth was that the state could do without the Jews, both in the bureaucratic apparatus and in the management of the estate.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=168}}</ref>\n[[File:IsabellaofCastile03.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]]]]\n\nWe must therefore reject the claim that the Hebrew community at the end of the fifteenth century was immensely rich and influential. \"In fact, the Spanish Jews at the time of their expulsion did not form a homogeneous social group. There were among them classes as in Christian society, a small minority of very rich and well-placed men, together with a mass of small people: Farmers, artisans, shopkeepers.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=168}}</ref> What united them was that they practiced the same faith, different from the one recognized, which made them a separate community within the monarchy and which was \"property\" of the crown which thereby protected them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=168-169}}</ref> In a letter dated 7 July, 1477, addressed to the authorities of [[Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres|Trujillo]], where incidents had occurred against the Jews, Queen Isabella I of Castile, after putting the aljama under her protection and prohibiting all type of oppression or humiliation against its members, states:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=174}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|All the Jews of my kingdoms are mine and are under my protection, and it is for me to defend and protect them and to keep them in justice.}}\n\nThus, the Jews \"formed not a State in the State, but rather a micro-society next to the majority Christian society, with an authority [the rabbi greater] that the crown delegated to him over its members.\" The aljamas were organized internally with a wide margin of autonomy. They designated by lottery the council of elders that governed the life of the community; collecting their own taxes for the maintenance of worship, synagogues, and rabbinical teaching; lived under the norms of Jewish law, and had their own courts that understood all cases in civil matters - from the Cortes de Madrigal of 1476 criminal cases had passed to the royal courts. But Jews did not enjoy the fullness of civil rights: they had a specific tax system far more burdensome than that of Christians and were excluded from positions that could confer authority on Christians.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|pp=169-170}}</ref>\n\nThe situation in which the Jews lived, according to Joseph Perez, posed two problems: \"as subjects and vassals of the king, the Jews had no guarantee for the future - the monarch could at any time close the autonomy of the aljamas or require new Most important taxes-\"; and, above all, \"in these late years of the Middle Ages, when a state of modern character is being developed, there could be no question of a problem of immense importance: was the existence of separate and autonomous communities compatible with the demands of A modern state? This was the real question.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp=170-171}}</ref>\n\n=== The Conversos and the Inquisition ===\n[[File:Tajador judeo-espa\u00f1ol s.XIV.jpg|thumb|Judeo-Spanish dish of century XIV]]\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the main problem stopped being the Jews to become conversos, who according to Henry Kamen probably numbered around three hundred thousand people.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Christian convert was applied to the Jews who had been [[Baptism|baptized]] and their descendants. As many of them had been forcibly converted, they were often looked upon with distrust by those who considered themselves [[Old Christian|Old Christians]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 17-18}}</ref>\nIn the fifteenth century the positions abandoned by Jews were mostly filled by converts, who congregated where Jewish communities had flourished before 1391, doing work formerly performed by Jews - trade and crafts - with the added advantage that as Christians they could now access trades and professions previously forbidden to Jews. Some even entered the clergy, becoming [[Biblical canon|canon]]s, [[prior]]s<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 19-20}}</ref> and even bishops.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p = 35}}</ref>\n\nThe socio-economic position of converts was viewed with suspicion by the \"old\" Christians, a resentment that was accentuated by the conscience on the part of those who had a differentiated identity, proud of being Christians and having Jewish ancestry, which was the lineage of Christ. Popular revolts broke out against the converts between 1449 and 1474, a period in Castile of economic difficulties and political crisis (especially during the civil war of the reign of Henry IV). The first and largest of these revolts took place in 1449 in Toledo, during which a \"Judgment-Statute\" was approved that prohibited the access to the municipal positions of \"no confesso of the lineage of the Jews\" - an antecedent of the following blood-cleaning statutes of the following century. The origin of the revolts was economic in Andalusia especially there was a situation of hunger, aggravated by an epidemic of plague - and in principle \"not directed especially against the converts.\" It is the parties and the demagogues that take advantage of the exasperation of the people and direct it against the converts.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 20-21| ps = \"The rich are hated because they are safe from hunger and disease; traders are accused of storing wheat to cause prices to rise; the houses of one and the other are looted.\"}}</ref>\n[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Cuadro ''[[La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos|Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' in which appears kneeling behind the king Ferdinand the Catholic, the inquisitor general [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]] and kneeling behind the queen the inquisitor of Aragon [[Pedro de Arbu\u00e9s|Pedro of Arbu\u00e9s]]]]\n\nTo justify the attacks on converts, they affirmed that ''conversos'' were false Christians and that they still practiced the Jewish religion in secret. According to Joseph Perez, it is a proven fact that, among those who converted to escape the blind furor of the masses in 1391, or by the pressure of the proselytizing campaigns of the early fifteenth century, some clandestinely returned to their old faith when it seemed that the danger had passed, of which it is said that ''Juda\u00edzan.'' The accusation of [[Crypto-Judaism]] becomes more plausible when some cases of prominent converts who continued to observe the Jewish rites after their conversion. But Joseph Judaizers, according to Joseph Perez, were a minority, although relatively important. He also affirms [[Henry Kamen]] when he says that \"it can be affirmed that in the end of the 1470\u2019s there was no Judaizing movement highlighted or proven among the converts.\" He also points out that when a convert was accused of judaizing, in many cases the \"proofs\" that were brought were in fact cultural elements of his Jewish ancestry - such as the Sabbath, not Sunday, as the day of rest - or the lack of knowledge of the new faith - such as not knowing the creed or eating meat in Lent - <ref>{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 44-46|ps = \"Anyone who does not adapt to the rest of the community will be I saw as \"Jew.\"{{what|date=September 2019}} Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, alchemist of Soria in the 1470\u2019s, disdained the official religion, but the parish priest described him as \"the wisest men in the world in all things.\" Precisely for this reason he was reputed, according to the testimony of an official, to be \"Jewish\"}}</ref>\n\nThis is how the \"convergent problem\" is born. The baptized can not renounce their faith according to the canonical doctrine of the Church by which [[Crypto-Judaism]] is assimilated to [[heresy]], and as such must be punished. This is how they begin to claim various voices including those of some converts who do not want to question the sincerity of their baptism because of those \"false\" Christians who are beginning to be called [[Marrano]]. And it also extends the idea that the presence of the Jews among the Christians is what invites the converts to continue practicing the [[Law of Moses]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 24-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Isabel I of Castile]] ascended to the throne in 1474, she was already married to the heir to the [[Crown of Aragon]], the future [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. At this time, there was no punishment for practicing [[crypto-Judaism]], not out of tolerance for Jews, but for legalistic reasons.{{efn|'''[[Crypto-Judaism]] was not punished:''' \"Certainly not because of tolerance or indifference, but because they lacked the appropriate legal instruments in order to define it as a crime.\" <small>''\"No, por cierto, por tolerancia o indiferencia, sino porque se carec\u00eda de instrumentos jur\u00eddicos apropiados para caracterizar este tipo de delito.{{thin space}}\"''</small><ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>}}\nThey decided to confront the \"[[converso]] problem\", especially after having received some alarming reports in 1475 by the Prior of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] of Seville, Friar Alonso de Ojeda{{efn|'''Friar Alonso De Ojeda:''' this is not [[Alonso de Ojeda]], Spanish navigator and conquistador, but a close relative of his with the same name.}} who reported that there were a large number of ''conversos'' in that city secretly practicing their religion in private, some even doing so openly.\nAfter receiving these reports, they applied to Pope [[Sixtus IV]] for authorization to name a number of [[inquisitors]] in their kingdom, which the pontiff agreed to in his [[papal bull|bull]] ''[[Exigit sincerae devotionis]]'' of {{date|1 November 1478}}.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|p=25}}</ref>\n\"With the creation of the Tribunal of the Inquisition{{efn|'''Tribunal of the Inquisition:''' officially, \"[[Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition]]\" ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisici\u00f3n|links=no}}) normally known in English as the [[Spanish Inquisition]].}}, the authorities will have sufficient instruments and methods of investigation at their disposal.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=171}}</ref>\nAccording to Joseph P\u00e9rez, Ferdinand and Isabella \"were convinced that the Inquisition would force the ''conversos'' to assimilate into society once and for all: the day when all of the new Christians would renounce Judaism, nothing would distinguish them anymore from any other member of society.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n== Expulsion ==\n\n=== Segregation of the Jews (1480) ===\n[[File:IsabellaofCastile05.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando II of Aragon]].]]\n\nFrom the beginning of their reign, [[Catholic Monarchs|Isabel and Ferdinand]] were concerned with protecting Jews - since they were \"property\" of the crown. For example, on September 6, 1477, in a letter addressed to the Jewish community of Seville, Queen Isabel I gave assurances about their safety:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2012|pp = 21-22}}</ref>{{what|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote| I take under my protection the Jews of the [[aljama]]s in general and to each one in particular, as well as to his people and their goods; I protect them against any attack, be it of the nature that is ...; I forbid that they attack, mate or hiera; I also prohibit a passive attitude if attacked, killed or injured.\nHence even the Catholic Kings until 1492 were reputed to be favorable to the Jews. This is what the German traveler, Nicolas de Popielovo says, for example, after his visit in 1484-1485:<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 175}}}</ref>\nHis subjects of Catalonia and Aragon speak publicly and the same things I have heard say to many in Spain that the Queen is protector of the Jews and daughter of a Jewish woman}}\nBut they could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at usurious interest, etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live in separate quarters, where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith.

This request was approved and in 1483, the kings gave a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the ports of the Crown of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2009|p=182}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Julio Valde\u00f3n, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia also obeyed \"the desire to move them away from the border between the crown of Castile and the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], scenario, during the eighties of the fifteenth century and the first years of the 1490s, of the war that ended with the disappearance of the last stronghold of peninsular Islam.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p = 93}}</ref>\n\n=== The genesis of the expulsion decree ===\n{{main|Alhambra Decree}}\n[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|thumb|225px|Sealed copy of the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]].]]\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n_de_los_jud\u00edos.jpg|thumb|225px|The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (in the year 1492) by [[Emilio Sala (painter)|Emilio Sala Franc\u00e9s]]]]\n\nOn March 31, 1492, shortly after the end of the Granada war, the Catholic Monarchs signed the decree of expulsion of the Jews in Granada, which was sent to all the cities, towns and lordships of their kingdoms with strict orders to not read it or make it public until May 1.<ref name = \"Rumeu\">{{cite book| last= Rumeu de Armas | first = Antonio | title = New light on the Santa Fe capitulations of 1492 between the Catholic Monarchs and Christopher Columbus: institutional and diplomatic study | page = 138-141 | editor = Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas | isbn = 9788400059613}}</ref> It is possible that some prominent Jews tried to nullify or soften it but did not have any success.

Torquemada presented the draft decree to the monarchs on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada \"demonstrates the leading role of [the Inquisition] in that matter.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez | 2009 | p = 187}}</ref>\n\nOf the decree promulgated in Granada on March 31, which was based on the draft decree of Torquemada - drawn up \"with the will and consent of their altezas\" and which is dated in Santa Fe On March 20 - there are two versions: One signed by the two monarchs and valid for the Crown of Castile and another signed only by King Ferdinand and valid for the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Between the draft decree of Torquemada and the two final versions and between these, they exist, according to Joseph Perez, \"significant variants.\" In contrast to the Torquemada project and the Castilian decree, in the version addressed to the Crown of Aragon the protagonism of the Inquisition is recognized - \" Persuading us the venerable father prior of Santa Cruz [Torquemada], inquisitor general of the heretical staidness usury is mentioned as one of the two crimes of which the Jews are accused: \"We find the Jewish sayings, by means of great and unbearable usages, to devour and absorb the properties and substances of Christians\"; We reaffirm the official position that only the Crown can decide the fate of the Jews since they are the possession of the kings - \"they are ours,\" it is said; And contains more insulting expressions against the Jews: they are accused of making fun of the laws of Christians and of considering them [[idolatry|idolaters]]; Mention is made of the abominable circumstances and of Jewish perfidy. The Judaism of \"leprosy\" is qualified; It is recalled that the Jews \"by their own fault are subject to perpetual servitude, to be slaves and captives.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez | 2009 | pp. 187-188}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the essentials the two versions have the same structure and expose the same ideas. The first part describes the reasons why the monarchs - or the king in the case of the Aragonese version - decided to expel the Jews. The second part detailed how the expulsion would take place.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 188}}</ref>\n\n=== The conditions of expulsion ===\nThe second part of the decree detailed the conditions for expulsion:<ref>{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=189}}</ref>\n# The expulsion of the Jews was final: \"we agreed to send all Jews and Jews out of our kingdoms and never return or return to them or any of them.\"\n# There was no exception, neither by reason of age, residence or place of birth - it included both those born in Castile and Aragon and those from outside.\n# There was a period of four months, which would be extended ten more days, until August 10, to leave the kings' domains. Those who did not do so within that period or who returned later would be punished with the death penalty and the confiscation of their property. Likewise, those who aided or concealed the Jews were liable to lose \"all their goods, vassals, and fortresses, and other inheritances.\"\n# Within the set period of four months the Jews could sell their real estate and take the proceeds of the sale in the form of bills of exchange, not in coinage or gold and silver because their exit was prohibited by law - or merchandise - as long as they were not arms or horses, whose export was also prohibited.\n\nAlthough the edict did not refer to a possible conversion, this alternative was implicit. As the historian [[Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] pointed out, the Jews had \"four months to take the most terrible decision of their lives: to abandon their faith to be integrated in it [in the kingdom, in the political and civil community], or leave the territory in order to preserve it.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez|2012|p=415}}</ref>\n\nThe drama that the Jews lived is documented by a contemporary source:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=112}}</ref>\n{{quote|Some Jews, when the term ended, went by night and day as in despair.

The most relevant case was that of [[Abraham Senior]], the chief rabbi of Castile and one of the closest collaborators of the monarchs. He and all his relatives were baptized on June 15, 1492 in the Guadalupe monastery, being his godfathers the kings Isabel and Fernando. He took the name of Fern\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez Coronel and his son-in-law Mayr Melamed, Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Coronel - the same name of pile that the one of the king. In this case, like that of Abraham de C\u00f3rdoba, he was given much publicity to serve as an example for the rest of his community. In fact during the four-month tacit term that was given for the conversion many Jews were baptized, especially the rich and the most educated, and among them the vast majority of the [[rabino|rabbis]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=111}}</ref>\n\nA chronicler of the time relates the intense propaganda campaign that unfolded:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=112}}</ref>\n{{quote|In all the synagogues and in the squares and in the churches and in the fields, by the wise men of Spain, and was preached to them by the holy gospel and the doctrine of the holy Mother Church, and was preached and tested by their own Scriptures, how the Messiah who waited were Our Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ, who came in the time to be agreed, which his ancestors with malice they ignored, and all the others who came after them never wanted to give ear to the truth; before being deceived by the false book of the [[Talmud]], having the truth before their eyes and reading it in their law every day, they ignored it and ignored it.}}\n\nThe Jews who decided not to convert \"had to prepare themselves for the march in tremendous conditions\". They had to sell their goods because they had very little time and had to accept the sometimes ridiculous amounts offered to them in the form of goods that could be carried away because the gold and silver output of the kingdom was prohibited - the possibility of taking [[bills of exchange]] were not much help because the bankers, Italians for the most part, demanded enormous interest. A chronicler of the time attests this:<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=112-113}}</ref>\n{{quote|They sold and squandered everything they could of their estates ... and in everything there were sinister ventures, and the Christians had their estates, very many and very rich houses and inheritances for few monies; and they prayed with them, and found not one to buy them, and gave a house for an ass and a vine for a little cloth or a linen cloth, because they could not bring forth gold or silver.}}\nThey also had serious difficulties in recovering the money lent to Christians because either the repayment term was after August 10, deadline for their departure, or many of the debtors denounced \"usury fraud\", knowing that the Jews, they would not have time for the courts to prove them right.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=113-114}}</ref> In a letter to the kings, the [[Ampudia]] Jews complained that \"The mayors of the said village made them and have closed many unreason and grievances says that they do not consent to them, nor do they want them to pay and pay their personal property and that they have no less, but they want to make and pay the debts owed to them and that which they deem urge them to do and then pay them even if the deadlines are not reached.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p=102}}</ref>\n[[File: Luis de Santangel.jpg |thumb|[[Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel]], a Valencian convert who collaborated with [[Isaac Abarbanel]] in the organization of the journey of the expelled Jews.]]\nIn addition they had to pay all the expenses of the trip - transport, maintenance, freight of the ships, tolls, etc. This was organized by Isaac Abravanel, who contracted the ships, having to pay very high prices and whose owners in some cases did not fulfill the contract or killed the travelers to steal what little they had.

Nowadays, some of those who argued at the time, such as the expulsion of the Jews to stay with their wealth, seem to have been discarded, since the majority of the Jews who left were the most modest, while the richest converted and they stayed, and on the other hand, the crown did not benefit at all from the operation - rather it was damaged because it stopped receiving the taxes paid by the Jews. Nor does the argument seem to hold that the expulsion was an episode of classes - the nobility wanted to get rid of an incipient bourgeoisie that represented the Jews and that supposedly threatened their interests - because many Jews were defended by some of the most important nobiliary families of Castile, and because he was also among the ranks of the \"bourgeoisie\" of \"old Christians\" where anti-Judaism grew the most.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|pp=99-100}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=117-118; 120-}}</ref>\n\nThe personal motives of the kings also seem to be ruled out, because everything indicates that they did not feel any repugnance towards Jews and converts. Among the trusted men of the kings were several who belonged to this group, such as the confessor of the queen [[Hernando de Talavera|fray Hernando de Talavera]], the steward [[Andr\u00e9s Cabrera]], the treasurer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] [[Abraham Senior]], or as Mayr Melamed or [[Isaac Abarbanel]], without counting the Jewish doctors that attended them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=124-125}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n jud\u00edos.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsion of European Jewish communities between 1100 and 1600. The main routes that followed the Spanish Jews are marked in light brown.]]\nCurrent historians prefer to place expulsion in the European context and stand out, such as [[Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez]] or Julio Valde\u00f3n, that the Catholic Monarchs were in fact the last of the sovereigns of the great western European states to decree The expulsion-the Kingdom of England did it in 1290, the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] in 1394; in 1421 the Jews are expelled from [[Vienna]]; in 1424 of [[Linz]] and of [[Cologne|Colonia]]; in 1439 of [[Augsburg]]; in 1442 of [[Bavaria]]; in 1485 of [[Perugia]]; in 1486 of [[Vicenza]]; in 1488 of [[Parma]]; in 1489 of [[Milan]] and [[San Luca|Luca]]; in 1493 of [[Sicily]]; in 1494 of [[Florence]]; in 1498 of Provenza...-.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=8}}</ref> The aim of all of them was to achieve unity of faith in their states, a principle that will be defined in the sixteenth century with the formula \"[[cuius regio, eius religio]]\", that the subjects should profess the same religion as their prince.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|pp=89; 99}}</ref>\n\nAs Joseph Perez pointed out, the expulsion \"puts an end to an original situation in Christian Europe: that of a nation that consents to the presence of different religious communities\" with which it \"becomes a nation like the rest in Christendom European\". \"The [[University of Paris]] congratulated Spain for having carried out an act of good government, an opinion shared by the best spirits of the time ([[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Guicciardini]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]])... [...] it was the so-called medieval coexistence that missed Christian Europe.<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=136-137}}</ref>\n\nJulio Valde\u00f3n affirms that the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, who \"showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews,\" was due to \"pressure from the rest of Christianity\" and to \"the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called \"deicides\", as well as the \"tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community.\" In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian [[Benzion Netanyahu]] that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Valde\u00f3n Baruque|2007|p=101}}</ref> A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. \"Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?\" Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term \"usury\", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, ritual crimes ... do not appear in any of the three versions.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=125-126}}</ref>\n\nFor Joseph Perez, the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, as evidenced by the content of the [[Alhambra Decree|Granada Edict]], is directly related to the \"converso problem\". The first step was the creation of the Inquisition, the second the expulsion of the Jews to eliminate those who allegedly incited the converts to Judaize. \"What concerned them [the kings] was the total and definitive assimilation of the converts, for which the previous measures failed; they resort to a drastic solution: the expulsion of the Jews to start evil.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=124}}</ref> \"The idea of expelling the Jews is part of the Inquisition, of which there is no doubt ... The Inquisition found the expulsion of the Jews the best way to put an end to the Judaizing converts: removed the Catholic Monarchs take the idea to their own account, but this does not mean that the pressure of the inquisitors is low. Heresy is not to their liking, they want to \"clean\" their kingdom, as the queen wrote, but these concerns are also political: they hope that the elimination of Judaism will facilitate the definitive assimilation and integration of converts into Spanish society\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=128-129}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Joseph Perez, following Luis Su\u00e1rez, places the expulsion within the context of the construction of the \"modern state,\" which requires greater social cohesion based on unity of faith to impose its authority on all groups and individuals of the kingdom. Unlike the medieval period in this type of state, it does not fit the groups that are governed by particular norms, as was the case of the Jewish community. It is therefore not a coincidence, P\u00e9rez warns, that only three months after having eliminated the last Muslim stronghold of the peninsula with the conquest of the Nazari kingdom of Granada, they decree the expulsion of the Jews. \"What was intended then was to completely assimilate Judaizers and Jews so that there would be no more than Christians. Kings must have thought that the prospect of expulsion would encourage Jews to become massively and that a gradual assimilation would do away with the remnants of Judaism\". \"They totally refused to assimilate as an alternative.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|pp=129-132}}</ref> However, \"assimilation\" is in this quotation a euphemism: what was offered to the Sephardic was in fact the conversion to a faith that was not his own, hence his Emigration in mass (towards the different directions indicated in the attached map).\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n=== The end of religious diversity in Spain ===\n[[File:Monumentoalatolerancia.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to Tolerance]] in [[Seville]], located in the place where five Jews were burned alive.]]\n[[File:Sephardic family in Bosnia, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Sephardic family of Bosnia [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|ottoman Bosnia]] (19th century).]]\n\nAs Joseph Perez pointed out, \"In 1492 the story of Spanish Judaism ends, which will only lead to an underground existence, always threatened by the Spanish Inquisition and the suspicion of a public opinion that saw In Jews, Judaizers and even sincere converts to natural enemies of Catholicism and Spanish idiosyncrasy, as understood and imposed by some ecclesiastical and intellectual leaders, in an attitude that bordered on racism.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|P\u00e9rez|2013|p=117}}</ref>\n\nHistoric accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000.

The effects were so severe that they changed the face of Tobago's economy.

Many of the plantations were subsequently abandoned, and the economy changed direction away from cash crop agriculture and toward tourism.

Tourism is still a fledgling industry and needs to be developed. The local governing body, The Tobago House of Assembly (THA), employs 62% of the labor force. \n\nTobago's economy is tightly linked with Trinidad which is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. The principal economic forces specific to Tobago are [[tourism]] and government spending. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, [[ecotourism]] is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on [[Little Tobago]], a small island off the main island's northeast tip.\n\nThe southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and [[Pigeon Point, Tobago|Pigeon Point]] has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at [[Castara]], Bloody Bay, and [[Englishman's Bay]]. Tobago is linked to the world through the [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport]] (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.  When producers saw the island for the first time, they \"fell instantly in love\".<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin|first=Leonard |year=1995 |title=The Disney Films : 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] |location=New York. |ref=harv |isbn=0-7868-8137-2 |page=176}}</ref> The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, 40 monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, 100 flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger.<ref name=TCM1/>\n\nFilming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road.

Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed. The waters around the island are home to many species of tropical fish, [[Batoidea|rays]], sharks, and turtles.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/discover-tobago/2016/apr/15/tobagos-spectacular-dive-sites\n</ref>\n\n===Golf===\nTobago is home to two golf courses, both of which are open to visitors. The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole. Formerly known as Tobago Plantations Golf Course, the recently renamed Magdalena Grand Hotel & Golf Club was opened in 2001 and has hosted the European Seniors Tour on three occasions. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Notable Tobagonians ==\n* [[Calypso Rose]], singer\n* [[Winston Duke]], actor\n* [[Renny Quow]], Olympic Sprinter\n* [[Kelly-Ann Baptiste ]] Olympic sprinter \n* [[Lalonde Gordon]], Olympic sprinter\n* [[Mighty Shadow]], singer\n* [[Keith Rowley]], politician\n* [[A.

Over the ensuing years, the Curonians ([[Duchy of Courland]]),  Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Swedish had caused Tobago to become a focal point in repeated attempts of colonisation, which led to the island having changed hands 33 times, the most in [[Caribbean]] history, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded it to the British in 1814.

Tourism is still a fledgling industry and needs to be developed. The local governing body, The Tobago House of Assembly (THA), employs 62% of the labor force. \n\nTobago's economy is tightly linked with Trinidad which is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. The principal economic forces specific to Tobago are [[tourism]] and government spending. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, [[ecotourism]] is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on [[Little Tobago]], a small island off the main island's northeast tip.\n\nThe southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and [[Pigeon Point, Tobago|Pigeon Point]] has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at [[Castara]], Bloody Bay, and [[Englishman's Bay]]. Tobago is linked to the world through the [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport]] (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.

The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road.

Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed.

The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole. Formerly known as Tobago Plantations Golf Course, the recently renamed Magdalena Grand Hotel & Golf Club was opened in 2001 and has hosted the European Seniors Tour on three occasions. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Notable Tobagonians ==\n* [[Calypso Rose]], singer\n* [[Winston Duke]], actor\n* [[Renny Quow]], Olympic Sprinter\n* [[Kelly-Ann Baptiste ]] Olympic sprinter \n* [[Lalonde Gordon]], Olympic sprinter\n* [[Mighty Shadow]], singer\n* [[Keith Rowley]], politician\n* [[A.
