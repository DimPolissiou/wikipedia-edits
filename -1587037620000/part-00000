The novel focuses on the narrator and protagonist Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen and his neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman, with whom Quentin has always had a romantic fascination. As preadolescents, Quentin and Margo together discovered the corpse of a local man who committed suicide in their neighborhood park. Nine years after this incident, Quentin is an outcast whose best friends are Ben and Radar, while Margo is a popular student\u2014both now seniors at [[Winter Park High School]]. A month before their graduation, Margo suddenly reappears in Quentin's life, climbing through his bedroom window as she did during their first meeting. She has devised an eleven-part plan of vengeance on a group of people she feels have hurt her during her time at high school; these people include her cheating boyfriend Jase and peers Lacey and Becca. Margo needs an accomplice and a car to help her complete the tasks, and Quentin accepts.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=2-30}} Margo and Quentin successfully implement the plot, share a romantically ambiguous dance, and return to their homes around dawn.\n\nThe next day, Quentin wonders hopefully whether Margo will start hanging out with him, Ben, and Radar; but Margo is reported missing by her parents after three days. Quentin, Ben, and Radar soon discover a series of items that Margo has left hidden for Quentin: a picture of [[Woody Guthrie]] on Margo's bedroom window shade, Margo's highlighted copy of [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman's]] poem \"[[Song of Myself]]\", and a written address in Quentin's bedroom doorjamb. Quentin and his friends follow these clues to find an abandoned [[strip mall|mini-mall]] in [[Christmas, Florida]], that contains evidence of Margo's recent presence. Quentin struggles to analyze all of Margo's clues and leftover materials in the mini-mall. He suspects the clues are meant to lead him to her current whereabouts, though he worries she may have committed suicide.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=85-149}}\n\nBased on a note Margo has left referring to \"paper towns\", Quentin realizes Margo may be hiding or buried in one of the many abandoned housing subdivisions\u2014\"pseudovisions\" or \"paper towns\"\u2014around Orlando. He drives to all of the pseudovisions where he feels that she may be hiding, but he cannot find her. On the day of his graduation, while getting ready, Quentin suddenly interprets an obscure Internet post to mean that Margo has been hiding in a [[fictitious entries|fictitious town]] in New York State called [[Agloe, New York|Agloe]] (which was created as a copyright trap by mapmakers) and that she plans to desert Agloe immediately after May 29. Quentin, Radar, Ben, and Lacey impulsively skip graduation to drive to Agloe to search for her, rushing to get from Florida to New York before noon on May 29.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=150-239}}\n\nIn Agloe, they discover Margo is living in an old, dilapidated barn. She is shocked to see them, which angers the group, who expected her to be grateful for their presence. Margo had left those clues to assure Quentin that she is okay, and she did not want to be found. Angry at her lack of gratitude, Radar, Ben, and Lacey leave the barn and spend the night at a motel. Quentin realizes the image he had of her was as fake as the one that she had been emitting to everyone else and becomes furious at her for wasting his time. Margo argues that Quentin saved her for egotistical reasons; he wanted to be a knight in shining armor who saved the troubled girl. Ultimately, Quentin accepts it was unfair for him to expect Margo to live up to his perfect image of her; and he begins to logically overcome his sexual attraction towards her. After their deep conversation, Margo decides to go to New York City and asks Quentin to accompany her. Quentin wants to stay with her, and they kiss, but he understands his home life and responsibilities prevent him from going. Margo promises to Quentin that she will keep in contact with him.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=279-305}}\n\n== Characters ==\n; {{visible anchor|Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen|Q|Quentin}}: The protagonist and narrator of the story. Quentin is the stereotypical rule-follower. He likes things to be neat and simple, making him the complete opposite of Margo. Quentin has had a crush on Margo since they were kids, but the distance he kept from her created a perfect image of her in his head that turned out not to be real. His desire to find her after she goes missing drives the events of the story.\n; {{visible anchor|Margo Roth Spiegelman|Margo}}: A self-described \"pretty girl\" who runs away from home only to be pursued by her childhood friend. Spiegelman is assertive but is from a dysfunctional Jewish family, and is one of the most popular girls at her local high school. She has a love for American literature, music, and travel. Her pet dog, Myrna Mountweazel, is a reference to Lillian Virginia Mountweazel,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/08/29/not-a-word | magazine=New Yorker | title=Not a Word | date=August 29, 2005 | accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> a woman who never existed, but was listed in the 1975 edition of the New Columbia Encyclopedia.\n; {{visible anchor|Ben Starling|Ben}}: One of Quentin and Radar's best friends. Travels with them and his girlfriend, Lacey. He is in the school band. He broke the record for a keg stand. Ben is basically the comic relief of the book, providing a much needed humorous energy on the trip.\n; {{visible anchor|Marcus \"Radar\" Lincoln|Marcus|Radar}}: He is one of Quentin's best friends. He was nicknamed by Quentin and Ben after the character from ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]].''{{sfn|Green|2008|p=12-13}} To his embarrassment, his parents own the world's largest collection of black Santas.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=22}} He is in the school band. He is also the brains of the group. He was very unwilling to follow along with much of the adventures they had, mainly because of his girlfriend, Angela, whom he was very loyal to.\n; {{visible anchor|Lacey Pemberton|Lacey}}: Lacey is the best and closest friend of Margo. They were friends since kindergarten. She is dating Ben after breaking up with Chuck Parson. Margo and Lacey have a strange friendship; Margo feels Lacey has always been judgmental of her throughout their relationship by sometimes saying, what Margo sees as, little insults to their difference in body type. After they reunite, Lacey is hurt that she worried so much and traveled all the way from Orlando, just to find that Margo didn't even care that they had found her after looking for so long, thereby straining their friendship.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=49-50}}\n\n== Structure ==\nThe novel is written in three parts. Each individual part is named for a specific metaphor used considerably in that section. The titles of sections are \"The Strings\", \"The Grass\", and \"The Vessel\". Each individual chapter within the first two parts is labeled with a number. However, the third part of the novel is divided into smaller sections. Each section refers to the hour of the characters' road trip.<ref>http://2novels.com/242779-paper-towns.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:John Green by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|John Green, author of ''Paper Towns'']]\n\nThroughout the novel, the concept of [[fictitious entry|paper towns]] is mentioned several times. As a former Orlando resident, John Green had seen and heard of many \"paper towns\". His first experience with a \"paper town\" occurred during his junior year of college while on a road trip. In South Dakota, he and his friend came across a paper town called Holen. At the end of the novel, John Green states that the story of [[Agloe]] presented in the text is mostly true: \"Agloe began as a paper town created to protect against copyright infringement. But then people with these old Esso maps kept looking for it, and so someone built a store, making Agloe real.\"{{sfn|Green|2008|p=206}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Paper Towns'' received mostly positive reviews. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, \"the title, which refers to unbuilt subdivisions and copyright trap towns that appear on maps but don't exist, unintentionally underscores the novel's weakness: both milquetoast Q and self-absorbed Margo are types, not fully dimensional characters\". It also said the novel is \"another teen pleasing read\".<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Paper Towns | newspaper =Publishers Weekly | location = | page =51 | publisher =Dutton | date = September 8, 2008}}</ref> ''Kirkus Reviews'' praised the novel as \"a winning combination\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-green/paper-towns/|title=Paper Towns|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref> ''[[School Library Journal]]'' said, \"Q is a great social outcast main character who sometimes thinks a little too much, but is completely relatable.

The novel focuses on the narrator and protagonist Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen and his neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman, with whom Quentin has always had a romantic fascination. As preadolescents, Quentin and Margo together discovered the corpse of a local man who committed suicide in their neighborhood park. Nine years after this incident, Quentin is an outcast whose best friends are Ben and Radar, while Margo is a popular student\u2014both now seniors at [[Winter Park High School]]. A month before their graduation, Margo suddenly reappears in Quentin's life, climbing through his bedroom window as she did during their first meeting. She has devised an eleven-part plan of vengeance on a group of people she feels have hurt her during her time at high school; these people include her cheating boyfriend Jase and peers Lacey and Becca. Margo needs an accomplice and a car to help her complete the tasks, and Quentin accepts.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=2-30}} Margo and Quentin successfully implement the plot, share a romantically ambiguous dance, and return to their homes around dawn.\n\nThe next day, Quentin wonders hopefully whether Margo will start hanging out with him, Ben, and Radar; but Margo is reported missing by her parents after three days. Quentin, Ben, and Radar soon discover a series of items that Margo has left hidden for Quentin: a picture of [[Woody Guthrie]] on Margo's bedroom window shade, Margo's highlighted copy of [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman's]] poem \"[[Song of Myself]]\", and a written address in Quentin's bedroom doorjamb. Quentin and his friends follow these clues to find an abandoned [[strip mall|mini-mall]] in [[Christmas, Florida]], that contains evidence of Margo\u2019s recent presence. Quentin struggles to analyze all of Margo's clues and leftover materials in the mini-mall. He suspects the clues are meant to lead him to her current whereabouts, though he worries she may have committed suicide.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=85-149}}\n\nBased on a note Margo has left referring to \"paper towns\", Quentin realizes Margo may be hiding or buried in one of the many abandoned housing subdivisions\u2014\"pseudovisions\" or \"paper towns\"\u2014around Orlando. He drives to all of the pseudovisions where he feels that she may be hiding, but he cannot find her. On the day of his graduation, while getting ready, Quentin suddenly interprets an obscure Internet post to mean that Margo has been hiding in a [[fictitious entries|fictitious town]] in New York State called [[Agloe, New York|Agloe]] (which was created as a copyright trap by mapmakers) and that she plans to desert Agloe immediately after May 29. Quentin, Radar, Ben, and Lacey impulsively skip graduation to drive to Agloe to search for her, rushing to get from Florida to New York before noon on May 29.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=150-239}}\n\nIn Agloe, they discover Margo is living in an old, dilapidated barn. She is shocked to see them, which angers the group, who expected her to be grateful for their presence. Margo had left those clues to assure Quentin that she is okay, and she did not want to be found. Angry at her lack of gratitude, Radar, Ben, and Lacey leave the barn and spend the night at a motel. Quentin realizes the image he had of her was as fake as the one that she had been emitting to everyone else and becomes furious at her for wasting his time. Margo argues that Quentin saved her for egotistical reasons; he wanted to be a knight in shining armor who saved the troubled girl. Ultimately, Quentin accepts it was unfair for him to expect Margo to live up to his perfect image of her; and he begins to logically overcome his sexual attraction towards her. After their deep conversation, Margo decides to go to New York City and asks Quentin to accompany her. Quentin wants to stay with her, and they kiss, but he understands his home life and responsibilities prevent him from going. Margo promises to Quentin that she will keep in contact with him.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=279-305}}\n\n== Characters ==\n; {{visible anchor|Quentin \"Q\" Jacobsen|Q|Quentin}}: The protagonist and narrator of the story. Quentin is the stereotypical rule-follower. He likes things to be neat and simple, making him the complete opposite of Margo. Quentin has had a crush on Margo since they were kids, but the distance he kept from her created a perfect image of her in his head that turned out not to be real. His desire to find her after she goes missing drives the events of the story.\n; {{visible anchor|Margo Roth Spiegelman|Margo}}: A self-described \"pretty girl\" who runs away from home only to be pursued by her childhood friend. Spiegelman is assertive but is from a dysfunctional Jewish family, and is one of the most popular girls at her local high school. She has a love for American literature, music, and travel. Her pet dog, Myrna Mountweazel, is a reference to Lillian Virginia Mountweazel,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/08/29/not-a-word | magazine=New Yorker | title=Not a Word | date=August 29, 2005 | accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> a woman who never existed, but was listed in the 1975 edition of the New Columbia Encyclopedia.\n; {{visible anchor|Ben Starling|Ben}}: One of Quentin and Radar's best friends. Travels with them and his girlfriend, Lacey. He is in the school band. He broke the record for a keg stand. Ben is basically the comic relief of the book, providing a much needed humorous energy on the trip.\n; {{visible anchor|Marcus \"Radar\" Lincoln|Marcus|Radar}}: He is one of Quentin's best friends. He was nicknamed by Quentin and Ben after the character from ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]].''{{sfn|Green|2008|p=12-13}} To his embarrassment, his parents own the world's largest collection of black Santas.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=22}} He is in the school band. He is also the brains of the group. He was very unwilling to follow along with much of the adventures they had, mainly because of his girlfriend, Angela, whom he was very loyal to.\n; {{visible anchor|Lacey Pemberton|Lacey}}: Lacey is the best and closest friend of Margo. They were friends since kindergarten. She is dating Ben after breaking up with Chuck Parson. Margo and Lacey have a strange friendship; Margo feels Lacey has always been judgmental of her throughout their relationship by sometimes saying, what Margo sees as, little insults to their difference in body type. After they reunite, Lacey is hurt that she worried so much and traveled all the way from Orlando, just to find that Margo didn't even care that they had found her after looking for so long, thereby straining their friendship.{{sfn|Green|2008|p=49-50}}\n\n== Structure ==\nThe novel is written in three parts. Each individual part is named for a specific metaphor used considerably in that section. The titles of sections are \"The Strings\", \"The Grass\", and \"The Vessel\". Each individual chapter within the first two parts is labeled with a number. However, the third part of the novel is divided into smaller sections. Each section refers to the hour of the characters' road trip.<ref>http://2novels.com/242779-paper-towns.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:John Green by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|John Green, author of ''Paper Towns'']]\n\nThroughout the novel, the concept of [[fictitious entry|paper towns]] is mentioned several times. As a former Orlando resident, John Green had seen and heard of many \"paper towns\". His first experience with a \"paper town\" occurred during his junior year of college while on a road trip. In South Dakota, he and his friend came across a paper town called Holen. At the end of the novel, John Green states that the story of [[Agloe]] presented in the text is mostly true: \"Agloe began as a paper town created to protect against copyright infringement. But then people with these old Esso maps kept looking for it, and so someone built a store, making Agloe real.\"{{sfn|Green|2008|p=206}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Paper Towns'' received mostly positive reviews. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said, \"the title, which refers to unbuilt subdivisions and copyright trap towns that appear on maps but don't exist, unintentionally underscores the novel's weakness: both milquetoast Q and self-absorbed Margo are types, not fully dimensional characters\". It also said the novel is \"another teen pleasing read\".<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Paper Towns | newspaper =Publishers Weekly | location = | page =51 | publisher =Dutton | date = September 8, 2008}}</ref> ''Kirkus Reviews'' praised the novel as \"a winning combination\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-green/paper-towns/|title=Paper Towns|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref> ''[[School Library Journal]]'' said, \"Q is a great social outcast main character who sometimes thinks a little too much, but is completely relatable.

The KR lost control of most Cambodian territory to [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnamese occupation]]. From 1979 to 1982, Democratic Kampuchea survived as a [[rump state]] supported by China.

Sihanouk, opposing the new government, entered into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge against them. Taking advantage of Vietnamese occupation of eastern Cambodia, massive United States [[carpet bombing]] ranging across the country, and Sihanouk's reputation, the Khmer Rouge were able to present themselves as a peace-oriented party in a coalition that represented the majority of the people. Thus, with large popular support in the countryside, the capital [[Phnom Penh]] finally [[Fall of Phnom Penh|fell on 17 April 1975]] to the Khmer Rouge. The KR continued to use Sihanouk as a figurehead for the government until 2 April 1976 when Sihanouk resigned as head of state. Sihanouk remained under comfortable, but insecure, house arrest in Phnom Penh, until late in the war with Vietnam he departed for the United States where he made Democratic Kampuchea's case before the Security Council. He eventually relocated to China.\n\nThus, prior to the KR's takeover of Phnom Penh in 1975 and the start of the Zero Years, Cambodia had already been involved in the [[Third Indochina War]] and tensions between Cambodia and Vietnam were growing due to differences in communist ideology and the incursion of Vietnamese military presence within Cambodian borders. The context of war destabilised the country and displaced Cambodians while making available to the KR the weapons of war. The KR leveraged on the devastation caused by the war to recruit members and used this past violence to justify the similarly, if not more, violent and radical policies of the regime.<ref>Kiernan, Ben. \"The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia Under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-79.\" New Haven, Conn: Yale University Press, 2002. p. 19.</ref> The birth of DK and its propensity for violence must be understood against this backdrop of war that likely played a contributing factor in hardening the population against such violence and simultaneously increasing their tolerance and hunger for it. Early explanations for the KR brutality suggest that the KR had been radicalised during the war years and later turned this radical understanding of society and violence onto their countrymen.<ref>Jackson, Karl D (ed.). \"Cambodia, 1975-1978: Rendezvous with Death.\" Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1992, p215.</ref> This backdrop of violence and brutality arguably also affected everyday Cambodians, priming them for the violence that they themselves perpetrated under the KR regime.\n\n[[Phnom Penh]] fell on 17 April 1975. Sihanouk was given the symbolic position of Head of State for the new government of Democratic Kampuchea and, in September 1975, returned to Phnom Penh from exile in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Press Staff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/26/archives/cambodians-designate-sihanouk-as-chief-for-life.html|title=Cambodians Designate Sihanouk as Chief for Life|date=18 April 1975|accessdate=28 October 2015|work=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827052735/http://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/26/archives/cambodians-designate-sihanouk-as-chief-for-life.html|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After a trip abroad, during which he visited several communist countries and recommended the recognition of Democratic Kampuchea, Sihanouk returned again to Cambodia at the end of 1975. A year after the Khmer Rouge takeover, Sihanouk resigned in mid-April 1976 (made retroactive to 2 April 1976) and was placed under house arrest, where he remained until 1979, and the Khmer Rouge remained in sole control.<ref name=Osborne>{{cite book|author=Osborne, Milton E|title=Sihanouk Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness|year=1994|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America|isbn=978-0-8248-1639-1}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation of Democratic Kampuchea ==\nIn January 1976, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] (CPK) promulgated the Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. The Constitution provided for a [[Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly]] (KPRA) to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. However, members of the KPRA were never elected, as the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK.\n\nDemocratic Kampuchea was an [[atheist state]], but Buddhist influences still persisted.<ref name=\"Wessinger2000\">{{cite book|last=Wessinger|first=Catherine|title=Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases|year=2000|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780815628095|page=282|quote=Democratic Kampuchea was officially an atheist state, and the persecution of religion by the Khmer Rouge was matched in severity only by the persecution of religion in the communist states of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[North Korea]], so there were no direct historical continuities with Buddhism into the Democratic Kampuchean era.}}</ref> All religions were banned and the repression of adherents of [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=495}}</ref> [[Christianity]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Quinn-Judge, Westad|first=Odd Arne, Sophie|title=The Third Indochina War: Conflict Between China, Vietnam and Cambodia, 1972-79|publisher=Routledge|page=189}}</ref> and [[Buddhism]] was extensive.

It was known also as the \"Centre\", the \"Organisation\" or \"[[Angkar]]\", and its daily work was conducted from Office 870 in Phnom Penh. For almost two years after the takeover, the Khmer Rouge continued to refer to itself as simply Angkar. It was only in a March 1977 speech that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence. It was also around that time that it was confirmed that Pol Pot was the same person as Saloth Sar, who had long been cited as the CPK's general secretary.\n\n=== Administrative ===\n[[File:Khmer Rouge Administrative Zones for Democratic Kampuchea, 1975-78.png|thumb|Administrative zones of Democratic Kampuchea]]\nThe Khmer Rouge government did away with all former Cambodian traditional administrative divisions. Instead of provinces, Democratic Kampuchea was divided into geographic zones, derived from divisions established by the Khmer Rouge when they fought against the ill-fated [[Khmer Republic]] led by General Lon Nol.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tyner|first=James A.|title=The Killing of Cambodia: Geopolitics, Genocide, and the Unmaking of Space|publisher=Ashgate|location=Burlington, VT|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7546-7096-4}}</ref> There were seven zones, namely the Northwest, the North, the Northeast, the East, the Southwest, the West and the Center, plus two Special Regions, i.e. the [[Krati\u00e9 Province|Kratie Special Region]] no 505 and (before mid-1977) the [[Siemreap|Siemreap Special Region]] no 106.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vickery|first=Michael|title=Cambodia : 1975\u20131982|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|year=1984|isbn=0-89608-189-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cambodia1975198200mich}}</ref> The regions were subdivided into smaller areas or ''damban''. These were known by numbers, which were assigned without a seemingly coherent pattern. Villages were also subdivided into 'groups' (''krom'') of 15\u201320 households who were led by a group leader (''Meh Krom'').\n\n=== Legal ===\nThe Khmer Rouge destroyed the legal and judicial structures of the Khmer Republic. There were no courts, judges, laws or trials in Democratic Kampuchea. The \"people\u2019s courts\" stipulated in Article 9 of the Constitution were never established. The old legal structures were replaced by re-education, interrogation and security centres where former Khmer Republic officials and supporters as well as others were detained and executed.<ref>[http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/635/20100726_Judgement_Case_001_ENG_PUBLIC.pdf Judgement of the Trial Chamber of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe Democratic Kampuchea regime maintained close ties with China (its main backer) and to a lesser extent with [[North Korea]]. In 1977, in a message congratulating the Cambodian comrades on the 17th anniversary of the CKP, [[Kim Jong-il]] congratulated the Cambodian people for having \"wiped out [...] counterrevolutionary group of spies who had committed subversive activities and sabotage\".<ref>Jackson, Karl D.

This name dated back to the peasant uprising that broke out in the [[Samlot district]] of [[Battambang Province]] in 1967. Under its long-time commander and then Minister of Defense [[Son Sen]], the RAK had 230 battalions in 35 to 40 regiments and in 12 to 14 brigades. The command structure in units was based on three-person committees in which the political commissar ranked higher than the military commander and his deputy.\n\nCambodia was divided into zones and special sectors by the RAK, the boundaries of which changed slightly over the years. Within these areas, the RAK's first task was the peremptory execution of former [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) officers and of their families, without trial or fanfare to eliminate KR enemies. The RAK's next priority was to consolidate into a national army the separate forces that were operating more or less autonomously in the various zones. The Khmer Rouge units were commanded by zonal secretaries who were simultaneously party and military officers, some of whom were said to have manifested \"[[warlord]] characteristics\". Troops from one zone were frequently sent to another zone to enforce discipline. These efforts to discipline zonal secretaries and their dissident or ideologically impure cadres gave rise to the purges that were to decimate RAK ranks, to undermine the morale of the victorious army, and to generate the seeds of rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Elizabeth|title=When the War Was over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1986|isbn=0-671-41787-8}}</ref> In this way, the KR used the RAK to sustain and fuel its violent campaign.\n\n== Khmer Rouge ideology and its relationship to violence ==\n=== Ideological influences ===\n[[File:PolPot.jpg|thumb|[[Pol Pot]] in 1978]]\n[[File:Khieu Samphan 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Khieu Samphan]] in 1978]]\n{{POV section|talk='Ideological influences' -section's neutrality|date=August 2015}}\nThe Khmer Rouge were heavily influenced by [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Karl D |title=Cambodia, 1975\u20131978: Rendezvous with Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02541-X |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h27D3EYGwzgC&pg=PA219 219]}}</ref> the [[French Communist Party]] and the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref>Ervin Staub.

In addition, because many of the top KR officials such as [[Pol Pot]], [[Khieu Samphan]] and [[Kang Kek Iew]] (also known as Duch) were educators and intellectuals, they were being unable to connect with the masses and were alienated upon their return to Cambodia, further fuelling their radical thought.<ref>Jackson, Karl D (ed.). \"Cambodia, 1975-1978: Rendezvous with Death.\" Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1992, p232.</ref> However, it is important to note that Vickery downplays the importance of personalities in explaining the DK phenomenon, noting that DK leaders were never considered evil by prewar contemporaries. Nonetheless, this view is challenged by some including Rithy Phan, who after interviewing Duch, the head of Tuol Sleng, seems to suggest that Duch was a fearsome individual who preyed on and seized upon the weaknesses of others.<ref>Phan, Rithy and Bataille, Christopher. \"The Elimination: a Survivor of the Khmer Rouge Confronts His Past.\" Clerkenwell Press, 2012. p34.</ref><ref>Vickery, Michael. \"Cambodia, 1975-1982.\" Boston, MA: South End Press, 1984. p152.</ref> All in all, the historical context of civil war, coupled with the ideological ferment in Cambodian intellectuals returning from France, set the stage for the KR revolution and the violence that it would propagate.\n\n[[File:Kang Kek Iew (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - 20091126.jpg|thumb|[[Kang Kek Iew]] (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]\n\n=== Operationalising ideology through violence ===\nThe Khmer Rouge was determined to turn the country into a nation of peasants in which the [[Political corruption|corruption]] and \"parasitism\" of city life would be completely uprooted. Communalisation was implemented by putting men, women and children to work in the fields, which disrupted family life. The regime claimed to have \"liberated\" women through this process and according to Zal Karkaria \"appeared to have implemented [[Friedrich Engels|Engels's]] doctrine in its purest form: women produced, therefore they had been freed\".<ref name=\"Zal Karkaria\"/> On the surface, society in Democratic Kampuchea was strictly [[egalitarian]]. However, this was not the case in practice as members and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living than the rest of the population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Pol Pot]], cities were emptied, organised religion was abolished, and private property, money and markets were eliminated.<ref>''Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the Twentieth Century'' [[Cornell University Press]], 2004. {{ISBN|0-8014-3965-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&pg=PA133&dq=khmer+rouge+abolish+private+property+emptied+cities&hl=en&ei=J54_TIKyKIL88Abch92ICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 127] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504104107/https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&pg=PA133&dq=khmer+rouge+abolish+private+property+emptied+cities&hl=en&ei=J54_TIKyKIL88Abch92ICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=4 May 2016 }}.</ref> An unprecedented [[The Killing Fields|genocide campaign]] ensued that led to annihilation of about 25% of the country's population, with much of the killing being motivated by Khmer Rouge ideology which urged \"disproportionate revenge\" against rich and powerful oppressors.<ref>Locard, Henri, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979) and Retribution (1979-2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030013853/http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf |date=30 October 2013 }}, ''European Review of History'', Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp.121\u2013143.</ref><ref>Nicholas A.

For instance, the country's ethnic Vietnamese population was almost completely wiped out; nearly all ethnic Vietnamese who did not flee immediately after the takeover were exterminated. One prison, Security Prison 21 (now the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]), held 17,000 people at one time or another, of whom only seven adults survived.\n\n== Explaining the violence ==\n=== Violence as a collective action ===\nWhile the historical context and ideological underpinnings of the KR regime provide reasons for why the [[Cambodian genocide]] occurred, more explanations must be had for the widespread violence that was carried out by Cambodians against Cambodians. Anthropologist Alexander Hinton's research project to interview perpetrators of violence during the KR regime sheds some light on the question of collective violence. Hinton's analysis of top-down initiatives shows that perpetrators in the KR were motivated to kill because KR leaders were effectively able to \"localize their ideologies\" to appeal to their followers.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p287.</ref> Specifically, Hinton spoke to two ideological palimpsests that the KR used. First, the KR tapped on the Khmer notion of disproportionate revenge to motivate a resonant equivalent\u2014class rage against previous oppressors.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p46.</ref> Hinton uses the example of revenge in the Cambodian context to illustrate how closely violence can be tied to and explained by the Buddhist notion of karma, which dictates that there is a cycle of cause and effect in which one's past actions will affect one's future life. Next, KR leadership built on local notions of power and patronage vis-\u00e0-vis Wolters\u2019 mandala polity to establish their authority as a potent centre.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p97.</ref> In so doing, the KR escalated the suspicion and instability inherent within such patronage networks, setting the stage for distrust and competition on which political purges were based.\n\n=== Violence as an individual action ===\nAfter establishing the historical and ideological context as the backdrop, Hinton delves deeper into the complexities of perpetrator motivation through using both macro- and micro-level analyses to uncover how ideology is linked to psychocultural processes. Under the KR, the encroachment of the public sphere into that which was once private space made constant group-level interactions. Within these spaces, cultural models such as face, shame, and honour were adapted to KR notions of social status and bound up with revolutionary consciousness.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p260, 288.</ref> Thus, individuals were judged and their social status was based on these adapted KR conceptions of hierarchy which were predominantly political in nature. Within this framework, the KR constructed essentialised categories of identity which crystallised difference and inscribed these differences on victim's bodies, providing the logic and impetus for violence. To save face and preserve one's social status within the KR hierarchy, Hinton argues that first, violence was practised by cadres to avoid shame or loss of face; and second, that shamed cadres could restore their face through perpetrating violence.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p275.</ref> At the level of individuals, the need for social approval and belonging to a community, even one as twisted as the KR, contributed to obedience, motivating violence within Cambodia.\n\n== Memorialisation in Cambodia ==\n[[File:Skulls at Tuol Sleng.JPG|thumb|Skulls at [[Tuol Sleng]]]]\n[[File:Choeung Ek genocidal center.JPG|thumb|[[Choeung Ek]] genocidal centre]]\nThe violent legacy of the KR regime and its aftermath continue to haunt Cambodia today. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid by the world to the atrocities of the KR, especially in light of the Cambodia Tribunal. In Cambodia, the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] and the [[Choeung Ek]] Killing Fields are two major sites open to the public which are preserved from the KR years and serve as sites of memory of the Cambodian genocide. The Tuol Sleng was a high school building that was transformed into an interrogation and torture centre called S-21 during the KR regime; today the site still contains many of the torture and prison cells which were created during the KR years. Choeng Ek was a mass grave site outside Phnom Penh where prisoners were taken to be killed; today the site is a memorial for those who died there.\n\nHowever, beyond these two public sites, there has not been much activity promoted by the Cambodian government to remember the genocide that occurred. This, in part, is due to numerous KR cadres remaining in political power in the wake of the collapse of the KR regime. The continued influence of KR cadres in Cambodia's politics has led to a neglect of the teaching of KR history to Cambodian children. The lack of a strong mandate to teach KR history despite international pressure has led to a proliferation of literary and visual production to memorialise the genocide and create sites through which the past can be remembered by future generations.\n\n=== In literature ===\nLike the Holocaust, the Cambodian genocide has spawned a host of literary publications in the wake of the KR regime's fall. Most significant to the history of the KR are the numerous survivor memoirs published in English as a way to remember the past. The first wave of KR memoirs began appearing in the late 1970s and 1980s. Soon after the first wave of survivors escaped or were rescued from Cambodia, survivor accounts in English and French began to be published. These memoirs tended to be authored either by foreigners or adult Cambodian males. Written to generate more awareness about the KR regime, these adult memoirs take into account the political climate in Cambodia before the regime and tend to call for justice to be served to the perpetrators of the regime. Being the first survivor accounts to reach global audiences, memoirs such as Haing Ngor's ''A Cambodian Odyssey'' (published 1987), Pin Yathay's ''L'Utopie meurtri\u00e8re'' (''Murderous Utopia'') (1979), Laurence Picq's ''Au-del\u00e0 du ciel'' (''Beyond the Horizon'') (1984) and Francois Ponchaud's ''Cambodge, annee zero'' (''Cambodia Year Zero'') (1977) were instrumental in bringing to the world the story of life under the KR regime.\n\nThe second wave of memoirs, published in the 21st century, is distinctly different from the first wave. Memoirs from the second wave include Chanrithy Him's ''When Broken Glass Floats'' (published 2000), Loung Ung's ''[[First They Killed My Father]]'' (2000), Oni Vitandham's ''On the Wings of a White Horse'' (2005) and Kilong Ung's ''Golden Leaf'' (2009). Published in large part by Cambodian survivors who were children during the period, these memoirs trace their journey from a war-torn Cambodia to their new lives in other parts of the world. To a larger extent than memoirs from the first wave, these memoirs reconstruct the significance of their authors' experiences before they left Cambodia. Having grown up away from Cambodia, these individuals use their memoirs predominantly as a platform to come to terms with their lost childhood years, reconnect with their cultural roots which they cannot forget despite residing outside of Cambodia and tell this story for their children. Noticeably, many of the authors of second wave memoirs draw out extended family trees in the beginning of their accounts in an attempt to document their family history. Additionally, some authors also note that despite them remembering events vividly, their memories were augmented by their relatives recounting those events to them as they grew up. Most significantly, the publication of the second wave of memoirs coincides with the Cambodia Tribunal and could be a response to the increased international attention paid to the atrocities of the KR.\n\n=== In media ===\nAs in literature, there has been a proliferation of films on the Cambodian genocide. Most of the films are produced in documentary style, frequently with the aim to reveal what really happened during the KR years and to memorialise those who lived through the genocide. Film director [[Rithy Panh]] is a survivor of the KR's killing fields and is the most prolific producer of documentaries on the KR years. He has produced ''[[Cambodia: Between War and Peace]]'' and ''[[The Land of the Wandering Souls]]'' among other [[documentary film]]s. In ''[[S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine]]'', two survivors of S-21 confront their former captors. In 2013, Panh released another documentary about the KR years titled ''[[The Missing Picture]]''. The film uses clay figures and archival footage to re-create the atrocities of the KR regime. Beyond Panh, many other individuals (both Cambodians and non-Cambodians) have made films about the KR years. ''[[Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia]]'' is a British documentary directed by David Munro in 1979 which managed to raise 45&nbsp;million pounds for Cambodians.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cambodia|Communism}}\n* [[Agrarian socialism]]\n* [[First Indochina War]]\n* [[First They Killed My Father (film)|''First They Killed My Father'' (film)]]\n* [[French Indochina]]\n* [[History of Cambodia]]\n* [[The Killing Fields (film)|''The Killing Fields'' (film)]]\n* [[List of socialist states]]\n* [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (Vietnamese occupation, 1979\u20131989)\n* [[Vietnam War]] (Second Indochina War)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Beang, Pivoine, and Wynne Cougill.

The KR lost control of most Cambodian territory to [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnamese occupation]]. From 1979 to 1982, Democratic Kampuchea survived as a [[rump state]] supported by China.

Sihanouk, opposing the new government, entered into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge against them. Taking advantage of Vietnamese occupation of eastern Cambodia, massive United States [[carpet bombing]] ranging across the country, and Sihanouk's reputation, the Khmer Rouge were able to present themselves as a peace-oriented party in a coalition that represented the majority of the people. Thus, with large popular support in the countryside, the capital [[Phnom Penh]] finally [[Fall of Phnom Penh|fell on 17 April 1975]] to the Khmer Rouge. The KR continued to use Sihanouk as a figurehead for the government until 2 April 1976 when Sihanouk resigned as head of state. Sihanouk remained under comfortable, but insecure, house arrest in Phnom Penh, until late in the war with Vietnam he departed for the United States where he made Democratic Kampuchea's case before the Security Council. He eventually relocated to China.\n\nThus, prior to the KR's takeover of Phnom Penh in 1975 and the start of the Zero Years, Cambodia had already been involved in the [[Third Indochina War]] and tensions between Cambodia and Vietnam were growing due to differences in communist ideology and the incursion of Vietnamese military presence within Cambodian borders. The context of war destabilised the country and displaced Cambodians while making available to the KR the weapons of war. The KR leveraged on the devastation caused by the war to recruit members and used this past violence to justify the similarly, if not more, violent and radical policies of the regime.<ref>Kiernan, Ben. \"The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia Under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-79.\" New Haven, Conn: Yale University Press, 2002. p. 19.</ref> The birth of DK and its propensity for violence must be understood against this backdrop of war that likely played a contributing factor in hardening the population against such violence and simultaneously increasing their tolerance and hunger for it. Early explanations for the KR brutality suggest that the KR had been radicalised during the war years and later turned this radical understanding of society and violence onto their countrymen.<ref>Jackson, Karl D (ed.). \"Cambodia, 1975-1978: Rendezvous with Death.\" Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1992, p215.</ref> This backdrop of violence and brutality arguably also affected everyday Cambodians, priming them for the violence that they themselves perpetrated under the KR regime.\n\n[[Phnom Penh]] fell on 17 April 1975. Sihanouk was given the symbolic position of Head of State for the new government of Democratic Kampuchea and, in September 1975, returned to Phnom Penh from exile in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Press Staff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/26/archives/cambodians-designate-sihanouk-as-chief-for-life.html|title=Cambodians Designate Sihanouk as Chief for Life|date=18 April 1975|accessdate=28 October 2015|work=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827052735/http://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/26/archives/cambodians-designate-sihanouk-as-chief-for-life.html|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After a trip abroad, during which he visited several communist countries and recommended the recognition of Democratic Kampuchea, Sihanouk returned again to Cambodia at the end of 1975.

The Constitution provided for a [[Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly]] (KPRA) to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. However, members of the KPRA were never elected, as the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK.\n\nDemocratic Kampuchea was an [[atheist state]], but Buddhist influences still persisted.<ref name=\"Wessinger2000\">{{cite book|last=Wessinger|first=Catherine|title=Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases|year=2000|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780815628095|page=282|quote=Democratic Kampuchea was officially an atheist state, and the persecution of religion by the Khmer Rouge was matched in severity only by the persecution of religion in the communist states of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[North Korea]], so there were no direct historical continuities with Buddhism into the Democratic Kampuchean era.}}</ref> All religions were banned and the repression of adherents of [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=495}}</ref> [[Christianity]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Quinn-Judge, Westad|first=Odd Arne, Sophie|title=The Third Indochina War: Conflict Between China, Vietnam and Cambodia, 1972-79|publisher=Routledge|page=189}}</ref> and [[Buddhism]] was extensive.

It was known also as the \"Centre\", the \"Organisation\" or \"[[Angkar]]\", and its daily work was conducted from Office 870 in Phnom Penh. For almost two years after the takeover, the Khmer Rouge continued to refer to itself as simply Angkar. It was only in a March 1977 speech that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence. It was also around that time that it was confirmed that Pol Pot was the same person as Saloth Sar, who had long been cited as the CPK's general secretary.\n\n=== Administrative ===\n[[File:Khmer Rouge Administrative Zones for Democratic Kampuchea, 1975-78.png|thumb|Administrative zones of Democratic Kampuchea]]\nThe Khmer Rouge government did away with all former Cambodian traditional administrative divisions. Instead of provinces, Democratic Kampuchea was divided into geographic zones, derived from divisions established by the Khmer Rouge when they fought against the ill-fated [[Khmer Republic]] led by General Lon Nol.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tyner|first=James A.|title=The Killing of Cambodia: Geopolitics, Genocide, and the Unmaking of Space|publisher=Ashgate|location=Burlington, VT|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7546-7096-4}}</ref> There were seven zones, namely the Northwest, the North, the Northeast, the East, the Southwest, the West and the Center, plus two Special Regions, i.e. the [[Krati\u00e9 Province|Kratie Special Region]] no 505 and (before mid-1977) the [[Siemreap|Siemreap Special Region]] no 106.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vickery|first=Michael|title=Cambodia : 1975\u20131982|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|year=1984|isbn=0-89608-189-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cambodia1975198200mich}}</ref> The regions were subdivided into smaller areas or ''damban''. These were known by numbers, which were assigned without a seemingly coherent pattern. Villages were also subdivided into 'groups' (''krom'') of 15\u201320 households who were led by a group leader (''Meh Krom'').\n\n=== Legal ===\nThe Khmer Rouge destroyed the legal and judicial structures of the Khmer Republic. There were no courts, judges, laws or trials in Democratic Kampuchea. The \"people\u2019s courts\" stipulated in Article 9 of the Constitution were never established. The old legal structures were replaced by re-education, interrogation and security centres where former Khmer Republic officials and supporters as well as others were detained and executed.<ref>[http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/635/20100726_Judgement_Case_001_ENG_PUBLIC.pdf Judgement of the Trial Chamber of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe Democratic Kampuchea regime maintained close ties with China (its main backer) and to a lesser extent with [[North Korea]]. In 1977, in a message congratulating the Cambodian comrades on the 17th anniversary of the CKP, [[Kim Jong-il]] congratulated the Cambodian people for having \"wiped out [...] counterrevolutionary group of spies who had committed subversive activities and sabotage\".<ref>Jackson, Karl D.

This name dated back to the peasant uprising that broke out in the [[Samlot district]] of [[Battambang Province]] in 1967. Under its long-time commander and then Minister of Defense [[Son Sen]], the RAK had 230 battalions in 35 to 40 regiments and in 12 to 14 brigades. The command structure in units was based on three-person committees in which the political commissar ranked higher than the military commander and his deputy.\n\nCambodia was divided into zones and special sectors by the RAK, the boundaries of which changed slightly over the years. Within these areas, the RAK's first task was the peremptory execution of former [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) officers and of their families, without trial or fanfare to eliminate KR enemies. The RAK's next priority was to consolidate into a national army the separate forces that were operating more or less autonomously in the various zones. The Khmer Rouge units were commanded by zonal secretaries who were simultaneously party and military officers, some of whom were said to have manifested \"[[warlord]] characteristics\". Troops from one zone were frequently sent to another zone to enforce discipline. These efforts to discipline zonal secretaries and their dissident or ideologically impure cadres gave rise to the purges that were to decimate RAK ranks, to undermine the morale of the victorious army, and to generate the seeds of rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Elizabeth|title=When the War Was over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1986|isbn=0-671-41787-8}}</ref> In this way, the KR used the RAK to sustain and fuel its violent campaign.\n\n== Khmer Rouge ideology and its relationship to violence ==\n=== Ideological influences ===\n[[File:PolPot.jpg|thumb|[[Pol Pot]] in 1978]]\n[[File:Khieu Samphan 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Khieu Samphan]] in 1978]]\n{{POV section|talk='Ideological influences' -section's neutrality|date=August 2015}}\nThe Khmer Rouge were heavily influenced by [[Maoism]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Karl D |title=Cambodia, 1975\u20131978: Rendezvous with Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02541-X |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h27D3EYGwzgC&pg=PA219 219]}}</ref> the [[French Communist Party]] and the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref>Ervin Staub.

In addition, because many of the top KR officials such as [[Pol Pot]], [[Khieu Samphan]] and [[Kang Kek Iew]] (also known as Duch) were educators and intellectuals, they were being unable to connect with the masses and were alienated upon their return to Cambodia, further fuelling their radical thought.<ref>Jackson, Karl D (ed.). \"Cambodia, 1975-1978: Rendezvous with Death.\" Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1992, p232.</ref> However, it is important to note that Vickery downplays the importance of personalities in explaining the DK phenomenon, noting that DK leaders were never considered evil by prewar contemporaries. Nonetheless, this view is challenged by some including Rithy Phan, who after interviewing Duch, the head of Tuol Sleng, seems to suggest that Duch was a fearsome individual who preyed on and seized upon the weaknesses of others.<ref>Phan, Rithy and Bataille, Christopher. \"The Elimination: a Survivor of the Khmer Rouge Confronts His Past.\" Clerkenwell Press, 2012. p34.</ref><ref>Vickery, Michael. \"Cambodia, 1975-1982.\" Boston, MA: South End Press, 1984. p152.</ref> All in all, the historical context of civil war, coupled with the ideological ferment in Cambodian intellectuals returning from France, set the stage for the KR revolution and the violence that it would propagate.\n\n[[File:Kang Kek Iew (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - 20091126.jpg|thumb|[[Kang Kek Iew]] (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]\n\n=== Operationalising ideology through violence ===\nThe Khmer Rouge was determined to turn the country into a nation of peasants in which the [[Political corruption|corruption]] and \"parasitism\" of city life would be completely uprooted. Communalisation was implemented by putting men, women and children to work in the fields, which disrupted family life. The regime claimed to have \"liberated\" women through this process and according to Zal Karkaria \"appeared to have implemented [[Friedrich Engels|Engels's]] doctrine in its purest form: women produced, therefore they had been freed\".<ref name=\"Zal Karkaria\"/> On the surface, society in Democratic Kampuchea was strictly [[egalitarian]]. However, this was not the case in practice as members and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living than the rest of the population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Pol Pot]], cities were emptied, organised religion was abolished, and private property, money and markets were eliminated.<ref>''Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the Twentieth Century'' [[Cornell University Press]], 2004. {{ISBN|0-8014-3965-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&pg=PA133&dq=khmer+rouge+abolish+private+property+emptied+cities&hl=en&ei=J54_TIKyKIL88Abch92ICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 127] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504104107/https://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&pg=PA133&dq=khmer+rouge+abolish+private+property+emptied+cities&hl=en&ei=J54_TIKyKIL88Abch92ICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=4 May 2016 }}.</ref> An unprecedented [[The Killing Fields|genocide campaign]] ensued that led to annihilation of about 25% of the country's population, with much of the killing being motivated by Khmer Rouge ideology which urged \"disproportionate revenge\" against rich and powerful oppressors.<ref>Locard, Henri, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979) and Retribution (1979-2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030013853/http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf |date=30 October 2013 }}, ''European Review of History'', Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp.121\u2013143.</ref><ref>Nicholas A.

For instance, the country's ethnic Vietnamese population was almost completely wiped out; nearly all ethnic Vietnamese who did not flee immediately after the takeover were exterminated. One prison, Security Prison 21 (now the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]), held 17,000 people at one time or another, of whom only seven adults survived.\n\n== Explaining the violence ==\n=== Violence as a collective action ===\nWhile the historical context and ideological underpinnings of the KR regime provide reasons for why the [[Cambodian genocide]] occurred, more explanations must be had for the widespread violence that was carried out by Cambodians against Cambodians. Anthropologist Alexander Hinton's research project to interview perpetrators of violence during the KR regime sheds some light on the question of collective violence. Hinton's analysis of top-down initiatives shows that perpetrators in the KR were motivated to kill because KR leaders were effectively able to \"localize their ideologies\" to appeal to their followers.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p287.</ref> Specifically, Hinton spoke to two ideological palimpsests that the KR used. First, the KR tapped on the Khmer notion of disproportionate revenge to motivate a resonant equivalent\u2014class rage against previous oppressors.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p46.</ref> Hinton uses the example of revenge in the Cambodian context to illustrate how closely violence can be tied to and explained by the Buddhist notion of karma, which dictates that there is a cycle of cause and effect in which one's past actions will affect one's future life. Next, KR leadership built on local notions of power and patronage vis-\u00e0-vis Wolters\u2019 mandala polity to establish their authority as a potent centre.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p97.</ref> In so doing, the KR escalated the suspicion and instability inherent within such patronage networks, setting the stage for distrust and competition on which political purges were based.\n\n=== Violence as an individual action ===\nAfter establishing the historical and ideological context as the backdrop, Hinton delves deeper into the complexities of perpetrator motivation through using both macro- and micro-level analyses to uncover how ideology is linked to psychocultural processes. Under the KR, the encroachment of the public sphere into that which was once private space made constant group-level interactions. Within these spaces, cultural models such as face, shame, and honour were adapted to KR notions of social status and bound up with revolutionary consciousness.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p260, 288.</ref> Thus, individuals were judged and their social status was based on these adapted KR conceptions of hierarchy which were predominantly political in nature. Within this framework, the KR constructed essentialised categories of identity which crystallised difference and inscribed these differences on victim's bodies, providing the logic and impetus for violence. To save face and preserve one's social status within the KR hierarchy, Hinton argues that first, violence was practised by cadres to avoid shame or loss of face; and second, that shamed cadres could restore their face through perpetrating violence.<ref>Hinton, Alexander Laban. \"Why did they Kill? : Cambodia in the Shadow of Genocide.\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005. p275.</ref> At the level of individuals, the need for social approval and belonging to a community, even one as twisted as the KR, contributed to obedience, motivating violence within Cambodia.\n\n== Memorialisation in Cambodia ==\n[[File:Skulls at Tuol Sleng.JPG|thumb|Skulls at [[Tuol Sleng]]]]\n[[File:Choeung Ek genocidal center.JPG|thumb|[[Choeung Ek]] genocidal centre]]\nThe violent legacy of the KR regime and its aftermath continue to haunt Cambodia today. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid by the world to the atrocities of the KR, especially in light of the Cambodia Tribunal. In Cambodia, the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] and the [[Choeung Ek]] Killing Fields are two major sites open to the public which are preserved from the KR years and serve as sites of memory of the Cambodian genocide. The Tuol Sleng was a high school building that was transformed into an interrogation and torture centre called S-21 during the KR regime; today the site still contains many of the torture and prison cells which were created during the KR years. Choeng Ek was a mass grave site outside Phnom Penh where prisoners were taken to be killed; today the site is a memorial for those who died there.\n\nHowever, beyond these two public sites, there has not been much activity promoted by the Cambodian government to remember the genocide that occurred. This, in part, is due to numerous KR cadres remaining in political power in the wake of the collapse of the KR regime. The continued influence of KR cadres in Cambodia's politics has led to a neglect of the teaching of KR history to Cambodian children. The lack of a strong mandate to teach KR history despite international pressure has led to a proliferation of literary and visual production to memorialise the genocide and create sites through which the past can be remembered by future generations.\n\n=== In literature ===\nLike the Holocaust, the Cambodian genocide has spawned a host of literary publications in the wake of the KR regime's fall. Most significant to the history of the KR are the numerous survivor memoirs published in English as a way to remember the past. The first wave of KR memoirs began appearing in the late 1970s and 1980s. Soon after the first wave of survivors escaped or were rescued from Cambodia, survivor accounts in English and French began to be published. These memoirs tended to be authored either by foreigners or adult Cambodian males. Written to generate more awareness about the KR regime, these adult memoirs take into account the political climate in Cambodia before the regime and tend to call for justice to be served to the perpetrators of the regime. Being the first survivor accounts to reach global audiences, memoirs such as Haing Ngor's ''A Cambodian Odyssey'' (published 1987), Pin Yathay's ''L'Utopie meurtri\u00e8re'' (''Murderous Utopia'') (1979), Laurence Picq's ''Au-del\u00e0 du ciel'' (''Beyond the Horizon'') (1984) and Francois Ponchaud's ''Cambodge, annee zero'' (''Cambodia Year Zero'') (1977) were instrumental in bringing to the world the story of life under the KR regime.\n\nThe second wave of memoirs, published in the 21st century, is distinctly different from the first wave. Memoirs from the second wave include Chanrithy Him's ''When Broken Glass Floats'' (published 2000), Loung Ung's ''[[First They Killed My Father]]'' (2000), Oni Vitandham's ''On the Wings of a White Horse'' (2005) and Kilong Ung's ''Golden Leaf'' (2009). Published in large part by Cambodian survivors who were children during the period, these memoirs trace their journey from a war-torn Cambodia to their new lives in other parts of the world. To a larger extent than memoirs from the first wave, these memoirs reconstruct the significance of their authors' experiences before they left Cambodia. Having grown up away from Cambodia, these individuals use their memoirs predominantly as a platform to come to terms with their lost childhood years, reconnect with their cultural roots which they cannot forget despite residing outside of Cambodia and tell this story for their children. Noticeably, many of the authors of second wave memoirs draw out extended family trees in the beginning of their accounts in an attempt to document their family history. Additionally, some authors also note that despite them remembering events vividly, their memories were augmented by their relatives recounting those events to them as they grew up. Most significantly, the publication of the second wave of memoirs coincides with the Cambodia Tribunal and could be a response to the increased international attention paid to the atrocities of the KR.\n\n=== In media ===\nAs in literature, there has been a proliferation of films on the Cambodian genocide. Most of the films are produced in documentary style, frequently with the aim to reveal what really happened during the KR years and to memorialise those who lived through the genocide. Film director [[Rithy Panh]] is a survivor of the KR's killing fields and is the most prolific producer of documentaries on the KR years. He has produced ''[[Cambodia: Between War and Peace]]'' and ''[[The Land of the Wandering Souls]]'' among other [[documentary film]]s. In ''[[S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine]]'', two survivors of S-21 confront their former captors. In 2013, Panh released another documentary about the KR years titled ''[[The Missing Picture]]''. The film uses clay figures and archival footage to re-create the atrocities of the KR regime. Beyond Panh, many other individuals (both Cambodians and non-Cambodians) have made films about the KR years. ''[[Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia]]'' is a British documentary directed by David Munro in 1979 which managed to raise 45 million pounds for Cambodians.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cambodia|Communism}}\n* [[Agrarian socialism]]\n* [[Cambodian genocide]]\n* [[First Indochina War]]\n* [[First They Killed My Father (film)|''First They Killed My Father'' (film)]]\n* [[French Indochina]]\n* [[History of Cambodia]]\n* [[The Killing Fields (film)|''The Killing Fields'' (film)]]\n* [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (Vietnamese occupation, 1979\u20131989)\n* [[Vietnam War]] (Second Indochina War)\n* [[List of socialist states]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Beang, Pivoine, and Wynne Cougill.
