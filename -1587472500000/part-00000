The siege was carried out with great energy and as the Christian forces managed to dig a small hole in the great walls of the castle, the Muslim garrison feared a fate like that of [[Maarat al-Numaan]] which was still fresh in the memory of Syrians, and offered to surrender. Despite the mild objections of the ruler of Tebnine (Husam El-Din Beshara),<ref name=Humph>Humphreys, 1977, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JfXl5kvabhoC&pg=PA107 107]</ref> representatives of the families of Tebnine came down the hilly side of the castle to the Frankish camp and asked for safety (''Al-Aman'') in exchange for the liberation of 500 Christian slaves. [[Ibn-Athir]], the famous Arab historian, winks that a lot of the rumors circulating in Tebnine about what the crusaders would do if the castle was taken by assault, came from none other than other Frankish lords who were not very happy to see a successful campaign led by king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem]], added to the fact that most of them had forged alliances with the sultan [[Al-Kamil]] of Egypt and were in no hurry to see it obliterated over some revolting massacres committed in Tebnine. The Germans would hear of no surrender. Tebnine promised pillage and fortune as well as glory to the knights who will return it to hand of the Christians. Chronicler [[Ernoul]] describes how the crusaders refused the Muslim offer and admits that it was a mistake not to accept the honorable offer of surrender.<ref>''Les Alemans se fient moult en lor force et en lor fausse vertu, ne n'orent piti\u00e9 des esclas crestiens que l'on lor devoit rendre,ne ne conurent le bien el l'onor qui lor avenait''</ref> Their arrogance made them parade the messengers in front of the secret dig that the crusaders were working under the wall of the castle. Tebnine's garrison was more resolved to resist than ever. It was indeed the site of that dig that witnessed the fiercest fight that day. The warriors of Tebnine fought so ferociously that the dig was rendered useless, and the crusaders forced to retreat from their attack. The siege continued, and the besieged thought that another offer to capitulate, made from a stronger position, would yield a more positive outcome. Once more, representatives of Tebnine families carried the offer of surrender as long as their lives are spared, and once more the response was less than polite from the German chancellor. When the messengers were back in the castle, they informed the garrison of the insulting reception that they received from the Franks, and the will to fight was again strong. Towards the evening, carrier pigeons brought news of reinforcements on the way dispatched by the sultan [[Al-Kamil]]. In February 1198, under the threat of the looming [[Ayyubid]] army, and the war of succession in Germany between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], the German forces ended the siege of Tibnine when the Chancellor and his princes abandoned their men to their fate outside the gates of [[Toron]], as described by [[Helmold von Bosau]].<ref>''Le chancelier et les autres princes, abandonnant le si\u00eage, ont secr\u00e8tement fait leurs bagages, constitu\u00e9 un convoi and sont partis pour Tyr.

The military commanders demanded strict and draconian restitution from poor villagers who were not involved in the clashes to begin with. The spirit of revolt was being slowly stewing for some time and it came to a head when the collaborators with French set up a market in Tebnine to sell the goods that were confiscated from the surrounding villages. It was a cheap tactic that was employed by the French and their collaborators more than once. Tebnine was the seat of the \"Saghir\" dynasty from which the Feudal \"Asa'ad\" family claims descent; If Tebnine was made to appear appeasing the occupiers, it will make the \"Asa'ad\" family appear in cahoots with French and reflect badly on their standing among the Shiites in south Lebanon. This is also why no taxes were levied on Tebnine after the sectarian incidences of 1920. In 1922, French colonials divided the province of [[Saida, Lebanon|Saida]] and created the [[Bint Jubeil]] province which included Tebnine.<ref name = Rida>{{cite book|last=\u0631\u0636\u0627|first= \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f|title=\u0645\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e|year=2009|publisher=\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631|location=Beirut|pages=138\u2013179\u2013180\u2013183\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n=== The Lebanese Civil War ===\nLeading up to the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]], like most of the surrounding area, the town was grounds to para-military actions carried out by the Palestine Liberation Organization: The Palestinian guerrilla fighters enjoyed wide spread support after 1967 war and for a short period past the 1968 Cairo accord which granted the PLO free range in Southern Lebanon to carry out missions aimed at liberating Palestine. Tebnine remained mostly unaffected by sectarianism  despite the co-existence of Muslims and Christians, and despite some of the Christians being aligned with the cause of right wing militias, whilst the majority of the Shiite residents of the city sympathized with the PLO and the various Lebanese Leftist Groups aligned with the Palestinians. Support waned in the later years as the PLO proved to be a corrupt and abusive force to the villagers.\nIn 1982 the Israeli invasion of south Lebanon wrecked the city as it did to most of the surrounding, and the PLO were rooted out and never really recovered the previous role.  The Shiite residents of the town, were mostly aligned with the [[Amal Militia]], whose leader [[Nabih Berri]] is a Tebnini. At the end of the civil war, [[Amal Militia|Amal]] handed over its heavy weapons to the National Lebanese Army and largely discontinued its resistance work against the occupying Israelis. This in turn allowed [[Hezbollah]] to dominate residents' sympathies. The town as a whole however, was subjected to the taunting of the [[South Lebanese Army]] (Israelis backed Phalanges) who would every now and then fire on the outskirts of the town.\n\n=== Israel-Lebanon conflict ===\n\nIn May 1978, the [[United Nations]] took over the security of South Lebanon by replacing the [[Lebanese Army]]. South Lebanon was in chaos in the wake of the first Israeli invasion aiming at pushing the PLO guerrillas behind the Litany river. The passing of [[UN security Council motion 425]] established an interim UNIFIL force in the area. The Irish Battalion named the Tebnine army base ''Camp Shamrock'', with a scorpion for its sigil as the land upon which the camp was constructed was rampant with the black scorpions of Tebnine with their venomous stings. For the most part, the UN were a welcome sight in Tebnine, and the Irish battalion in particular, spared no expense in the aid of the locals from social services to continuous blood donations to the Tebnine Red Cross unit. The feeling of friendship grew between the locals and the Irish which translated into endless soccer tournaments as well as being invited to weddings, dabkahs, and other social events.\nCamp Shamrock was responsible for the building and partial maintenance of the Tebnine Orphanage.<ref>http://www.peace.ie/lebanon/orphanage.html</ref>\n\n[[File:mayorhousetebnine.jpg|thumb|The home of the Tebnine mayor damaged during the war.]][[File:Zakouk.jpg|thumb|180px|The old center (Zakouk)]]\nDuring the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|war between Israel and Lebanon]] in July 2006, like other villages, Tebnine had many homes destroyed but not of the magnitude of villages like [[Bint Jbeil]], [[Qana]] and [[Aita Shaab]].\n\nIn the old center (Zakouk), located in the upper part of town near The Crusader Castle, most of the homes are completely destroyed or damaged.\n\nNear the government hospital there is a central hub for transportation in and out of the village.\nFor the first time since the civil war in 1975, The Lebanese Army has returned to South Lebanon including Tebnine as one of the conditions of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UN Resolution 1701]].\n\n[[File:Tebnine Hall Town.jpg|thumb|180px|Tebnine's Hall Town]]\n\n== Geography and Demographics ==\nThe town's population are mostly [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite Muslims]], with a small minority of [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]]. No exact population count has been taken since the census of 1932, however estimates show that the population could be around 5,000.\n\nTebnine has several provincial institutions such as a governmental hospital, a police station, post office as well as touristic sites such as cafes and commercial shops. It is known as one of the most diverse villages in south Lebanon.\n\nMany of Tebnine's natives live abroad primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] although many are scattered throughout the entire world.  Most Tebnine natives return during the summer where the village becomes a lively place as people come from both [[Beirut]] and foreign countries for their summer vacation.\n\nThe nightlife is marked with a family-like gathering of the townspeople who often dress fashionably and \"hang out\" at the various cafes.\n\nTebnine is also well known for the ''Kazdoura'' (promenade) a long stretch of road that extends from the beginning to the end of the village and where the townspeople often take their evening strolls. It also hosts a weekly flea market called the ''Souq al-jumaa'' (Friday's market).\n\nMany of the townspeople speak some English due to the large number of immigrants as well as the presence of [[UNIFIL]] Peacekeepers.\n\nThe 2006 Lebanon-Israel war, Tebnine had a record number of foreigners and returning nationals visit the village. Much of the damage incurred on this war, initiated by Israel, has yet to be repaired by the Lebanese government.\n\n===Climate===\nTebnine enjoys a temperate climate which is characteristic of south Lebanon: Mild rainy winters and arid summers with a few excessively warm days.

The siege was carried out with great energy and as the Christian forces managed to dig a small hole in the great walls of the castle, the Muslim garrison feared a fate like that of [[Maarat al-Numaan]] which was still fresh in the memory of Syrians, and offered to surrender. Despite the mild objections of the ruler of Tebnine (Husam El-Din Beshara),<ref name=Humph>Humphreys, 1977, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JfXl5kvabhoC&pg=PA107 107]</ref> representatives of the families of Tebnine came down the hilly side of the castle to the Frankish camp and asked for safety (''Al-Aman'') in exchange for the liberation of 500 Christian slaves. [[Ibn-Athir]], the famous Arab historian, winks that a lot of the rumors circulating in Tebnine about what the crusaders would do if the castle was taken by assault, came from none other than other Frankish lords who were not very happy to see a successful campaign led by king [[Amalric II of Jerusalem]], added to the fact that most of them had forged alliances with the sultan [[Al-Kamil]] of Egypt and were in no hurry to see it obliterated over some revolting massacres committed in Tebnine. The Germans would hear of no surrender. Tebnine promised pillage and fortune as well as glory to the knights who will return it to hand of the Christians. Chronicler [[Ernoul]] describes how the crusaders refused the Muslim offer and admits that it was a mistake not to accept the honorable offer of surrender.<ref>''Les Alemans se fient moult en lor force et en lor fausse vertu, ne n'orent piti\u00e9 des esclas crestiens que l'on lor devoit rendre,ne ne conurent le bien el l'onor qui lor avenait''</ref> Their arrogance made them parade the messengers in front of the secret dig that the crusaders were working under the wall of the castle. Tebnine's garrison was more resolved to resist than ever. It was indeed the site of that dig that witnessed the fiercest fight that day. The warriors of Tebnine fought so ferociously that the dig was rendered useless, and the crusaders forced to retreat from their attack. The siege continued, and the besieged thought that another offer to capitulate, made from a stronger position, would yield a more positive outcome. Once more, representatives of Tebnine families carried the offer of surrender as long as their lives are spared, and once more the response was less than polite from the German chancellor. When the messengers were back in the castle, they informed the garrison of the insulting reception that they received from the Franks, and the will to fight was again strong. Towards the evening, carrier pigeons brought news of reinforcements on the way dispatched by the sultan [[Al-Kamil]]. In February 1198, under the threat of the looming [[Ayyubid]] army, and the war of succession in Germany between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], the German forces ended the siege of Tibnine when the Chancellor and his princes abandoned their men to their fate outside the gates of [[Toron]], as described by [[Helmold von Bosau]].<ref>''Le chancelier et les autres princes, abandonnant le si\u00eage, ont secr\u00e8tement fait leurs bagages, constitu\u00e9 un convoi and sont partis pour Tyr.

Montfort married [[Maria of Antioch-Armenia]], the last remaining heiress to the Toron family, and seized the riches of Tibnin and its castle and imposed a tax on caravans using the spring beneath the castle.

The 'al-Saghir' brothers fostered the strength of their feudal system by aligning themselves with the [[Druze]] emirs, and were even tolerated by Emir [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhr ad-Din II]].\nTheir reign lasted until the tyrant [[Jezzar Pasha]] ascended to power in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in the eighteenth century, who with the aid of the obedient emir [[Bashir Shihab II]], crushed 'al-Saghir's autonomous feudal system in the area and kicked their men out of Tibnine. However, in 1783, 'al-Saghir' clansmen and other, aligned themselves with emir [[Yusuf Shihab]] and ousted the forces of [[Jezzar Pasha]] from Tibnine, and reclaimed the castle as their home base, only to be betrayed by Yusuf Shihab and sent to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to be promptly executed.<ref name=Winter>Winter, 2010, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGeuAeFFJCEC&pg=PA142 142]\u2013143</ref>    \nIn the later days of the Ottoman Empire, Tibnine was the \"Chef-Lieu\" of \"Bilad Bcharrah\" where the Ottoman [[Kaymakam]] took residence.<ref name=Chauvet /> This is how American traveler [[Rob Morris (Freemason)|Rob Morris]] found the town in 1868. Morris describes the enchanting beauty of the town and despite being certain of his credentials being honored by the [[Pasha]] occupying the castle, he takes up residence with one of the families in the village, and mentions the tyranny with which the Ottoman troops treated the locals.<ref name=Morris>Morris, 1876, p.

[[Adham Khanjar]] attempted to recruit followers in Tebnine and may have had some success initially due to the desire of some among the locals who wished unity with Syria.<ref name=Shawki>{{cite book|last=\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647|first=\u0634\u0648\u0642\u064a|title=\u0645\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0634\u0648\u0642\u064a \u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647|year=1990|publisher=\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f|location=Beirut|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> \nHowever, [[Adham Khanjar]]'s sectarian views alienated the residents of Tebnine who always boasted an acceptance and coexistence between Christians and Moslems, and eventually rooted all support for [[Adham Khanjar]]'s band from the city.\nAfter Khanjar's capture, and the subsequent rebellion in [[Jabal al-Druze]], members of the band of rebels that [[Adham Khanjar]] led, returned home only to be promptly arrested by the French authorities.\nIn 1921, Under orders from [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], the occupying French forces in Lebanon responded to sectarian clashes in the south with a massive campaign targeting Shiite villagers. The military commanders demanded strict and draconian restitution from poor villagers who were not involved in the clashes to begin with. The spirit of revolt was being slowly stewing for some time and it came to a head when the collaborators with French set up a market in Tebnine to sell the goods that were confiscated from the surrounding villages. It was a cheap tactic that was employed by the French and their collaborators more than once. Tebnine was the seat of the \"Saghir\" dynasty from which the Feudal \"Asa'ad\" family claims descent; If Tebnine was made to appear appeasing the occupiers, it will make the \"Asa'ad\" family appear in cahoots with French and reflect badly on their standing among the Shiites in south Lebanon. This is also why no taxes were levied on Tebnine after the sectarian incidences of 1920. In 1922, French colonials divided the province of [[Saida, Lebanon|Saida]] and created the [[Bint Jubeil]] province which included Tebnine.<ref name = Rida>{{cite book|last=\u0631\u0636\u0627|first= \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f|title=\u0645\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e|year=2009|publisher=\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631|location=Beirut|pages=138\u2013179\u2013180\u2013183\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n=== The Lebanese Civil War ===\nLeading up to the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]], like most of the surrounding area, the town was grounds to para-military actions carried out by the Palestine Liberation Organization: The Palestinian guerrilla fighters enjoyed wide spread support after 1967 war and for a short period past the 1968 Cairo accord which granted the PLO free range in Southern Lebanon to carry out missions aimed at liberating Palestine. Tebnine remained mostly unaffected by sectarianism  despite the co-existence of Muslims and Christians, and despite some of the Christians being aligned with the cause of right wing militias, whilst the majority of the Shiite residents of the city sympathized with the PLO and the various Lebanese Leftist Groups aligned with the Palestinians. Support waned in the later years as the PLO proved to be a corrupt and abusive force to the villagers.\nIn 1982 the Israeli invasion of south Lebanon wrecked the city as it did to most of the surrounding, and the PLO were rooted out and never really recovered the previous role.  The Shiite residents of the town, were mostly aligned with the [[Amal Militia]], whose leader [[Nabih Berri]] is a Tebnini. At the end of the civil war, [[Amal Militia|Amal]] handed over its heavy weapons to the National Lebanese Army and largely discontinued its resistance work against the occupying Israelis. This in turn allowed [[Hezbollah]] to dominate residents' sympathies. The town as a whole however, was subjected to the taunting of the [[South Lebanese Army]] (Israelis backed Phalanges) who would every now and then fire on the outskirts of the town.\n\n=== Israel-Lebanon conflict ===\n\nIn May 1978, the [[United Nations]] took over the security of South Lebanon by replacing the [[Lebanese Army]]. South Lebanon was in chaos in the wake of the first Israeli invasion aiming at pushing the PLO guerrillas behind the Litany river. The passing of [[UN security Council motion 425]] established an interim UNIFIL force in the area. The Irish Battalion named the Tebnine army base ''Camp Shamrock'', with a scorpion for its sigil as the land upon which the camp was constructed was rampant with the black scorpions of Tebnine with their venomous stings. For the most part, the UN were a welcome sight in Tebnine, and the Irish battalion in particular, spared no expense in the aid of the locals from social services to continuous blood donations to the Tebnine Red Cross unit. The feeling of friendship grew between the locals and the Irish which translated into endless soccer tournaments as well as being invited to weddings, dabkahs, and other social events.\nCamp Shamrock was responsible for the building and partial maintenance of the Tebnine Orphanage.<ref>http://www.peace.ie/lebanon/orphanage.html</ref>\n\n[[File:mayorhousetebnine.jpg|thumb|The home of the Tebnine mayor damaged during the war.]][[File:Zakouk.jpg|thumb|180px|The old center (Zakouk)]]\nDuring the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|war between Israel and Lebanon]] in July 2006, like other villages, Tebnine had many homes destroyed but not of the magnitude of villages like [[Bint Jbeil]], [[Qana]] and [[Aita Shaab]].\n\nIn the old center (Zakouk), located in the upper part of town near The Crusader Castle, most of the homes are completely destroyed or damaged.\n\nNear the government hospital there is a central hub for transportation in and out of the village.\nFor the first time since the civil war in 1975, The Lebanese Army has returned to South Lebanon including Tebnine as one of the conditions of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UN Resolution 1701]].\n\n[[File:Tebnine Hall Town.jpg|thumb|180px|Tebnine's Hall Town]]\n\n== Geography and Demographics ==\nThe town's population are mostly [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite Muslims]], with a small minority of [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]]. No exact population count has been taken since the census of 1932, however estimates show that the population could be around 5,000.\n\nTebnine has several provincial institutions such as a governmental hospital, a police station, post office as well as touristic sites such as cafes and commercial shops. It is known as one of the most diverse villages in south Lebanon.\n\nMany of Tebnine's natives live abroad primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] although many are scattered throughout the entire world.  Most Tebnine natives return during the summer where the village becomes a lively place as people come from both [[Beirut]] and foreign countries for their summer vacation.\n\nThe nightlife is marked with a family-like gathering of the townspeople who often dress fashionably and \"hang out\" at the various cafes.\n\nTebnine is also well known for the ''Kazdoura'' (promenade) a long stretch of road that extends from the beginning to the end of the village and where the townspeople often take their evening strolls. It also hosts a weekly flea market called the ''Souq al-jumaa'' (Friday's market).\n\nMany of the townspeople speak some English due to the large number of immigrants as well as the presence of [[UNIFIL]] Peacekeepers.\n\nThe 2006 Lebanon-Israel war, Tebnine had a record number of foreigners and returning nationals visit the village. Much of the damage incurred on this war, initiated by Israel, has yet to be repaired by the Lebanese government.\n\n===Climate===\nTebnine enjoys a temperate climate which is characteristic of south Lebanon: Mild rainy winters and arid summers with a few excessively warm days. In recent years, due to the warming of the planet and deforestation, the amount of precipitation is noticeably reduced.\n{{Weather box \n|width = auto\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location = Tebnine\n\n| Jan high C  =13.4\n| Feb high C  =14.1\n| Mar high C  =16.8\n| Apr high C  =21.0\n| May high C  =25.5\n| Jun high C  =28.5\n| Jul high C  =29.7\n| Aug high C  =30.7\n| Sep high C  =28.5\n| Oct high C  =26.4\n| Nov high C  =21.0\n| Dec high C  =16.0\n\n| Jan mean C  =10.3\n| Feb mean C  =10.8\n| Mar mean C  =12.8\n| Apr mean C  =16.1\n| May mean C  =20.0\n| Jun mean C  =23.0\n| Jul mean C  =24.5\n| Aug mean C  =25.5\n| Sep mean C  =23.6\n| Oct mean C  =21.6\n| Nov mean C  =17.0\n| Dec mean C  =12.7\n\n| Jan low C  =7.3\n| Feb low C  =7.6\n| Mar low C  =8.8\n| Apr low C  =11.2\n| May low C  =14.6\n| Jun low C  =17.6\n| Jul low C  =19.3\n| Aug low C  =20.3\n| Sep low C  =18.8\n| Oct low C  =16.8\n| Nov low C  =13.0\n| Dec low C  =9.4\n\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm  =209\n| Feb precipitation mm  =170\n| Mar precipitation mm  =113\n| Apr precipitation mm  =51\n| May precipitation mm  =16\n| Jun precipitation mm  =1\n| Jul precipitation mm  =0\n| Aug precipitation mm  =0\n| Sep precipitation mm  =3\n| Oct precipitation mm  =27\n| Nov precipitation mm  =84\n| Dec precipitation mm  =158\n\n| source = <ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\"> {{cite web\n|url = https://en.climate-data.org/location/417902/\n|title = Climate: Tebnine\n|publisher = Climate-Data.org\n|access-date = March 24, 2018}} </ref>\n}}\n\n==Landmarks and events==\n\n===Tebnine Heritage Festival===\nIn 2012, funding from the E.U. allowed Tebnine to celebrate its Heritage Festival in the old Castle, where lighting had been refurbished by the French troops of [[UNIFIL]].\n\n=== Crusader Castle ===\n[[File:Tebnine11.jpg|thumb|180px|The Crusader Castle in the village of Tebnine]]\n[[Hugh of Fauquembergues]], the second prince of Galilee and governor of [[Tiberias]], organized many attacks against [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] but his forces were always tired by the long distance between his base in [[Tiberias]] and his coastal target.

Shortly after the death of Hugh, Tyre's garrison, under the command of its governor 'Izz al-Mulk', launched a sortie against the fortress and razed its surroundings. King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] of [[Jerusalem]] recaptured and rebuilt the castle and gave its rule to [[Gervaise of Bazoches]] of Tiberias, but he was shortly after captured by the forces of [[Damascus]] under the command of Zahir ad-Din [[Toghtekin]], who made Gervaise choose between [[Islam]] or death.<ref name=Pirie />  The seigneurie of Toron passed to a knight called 'Onfroi' who took the title of 'de Toron', ([[Humphrey I of Toron]]) and so began the story of one of the most prestigious crusader families of the kingdom of Jerusalem.<ref name=Pirie>{{cite journal|last=Pirie-Gordon|first=H.|title=The Reigning Princes Of Galilee|journal=The English Historical Review|date=July 1912|volume=27|issue=107|pages=445\u2013461|doi=10.1093/ehr/xxvii.cvii.445|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431722}}</ref> \nToron was then detached from the Principality Of Galilee and made into an independent lordship, though some historians argue a later date for that detachment.<ref name=Tibble>{{cite book|last=Tibble|first=Steven|title=Monarchy and Lordships in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099 - 1291|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Walton St,Oxsford|isbn=978-0-19-822731-1|pages=13\u201323, 28, 52, 60\u20135, 70\u20132, 89\u201392, 95\u20138, 168}}</ref> \nThe fortress was later conquered by [[Saladin]] in 1187 and then taken back by the Franks in 1229.
