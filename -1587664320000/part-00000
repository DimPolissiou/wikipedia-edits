The ''LM'' defendants and Thomas Deichmann were properly represented at the trial and were able to lay out all the details of their claim that the ITN reporters had \"deliberately misrepresented\" the situation at Trnopolje. Having charged 'deliberate misrepresentation', they needed to prove 'deliberate misrepresentation'. To this end, the ''LM'' defendants were able to cross-examine Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, as well as every member of the ITN crews who were at the camps, along with other witnesses. (That they didn't take up the opportunity to cross-examine the Bosnian doctor imprisoned at Trnopolje, who featured in the ITN stories and was called to testify on the conditions he and others suffered, was perhaps the moment any remaining shred of credibility for ''LM''{{'}}s allegations evaporated). They were able to show the ITN reports to the court, including the rushes from which the final TV stories were edited, and conduct a forensic examination of the visuals they alleged were deceitful. And all of this took place in front of a jury of twelve citizens who they needed to convince about the truthfulness of their allegations.\n\nThey failed. The jury found unanimously against ''LM'' and awarded the maximum possible damages. So it was not ITN that bankrupted ''LM''. It was ''LM''{{'}}s lies about the ITN reports that bankrupted themselves, morally and financially. Despite their failure, those who lied about the ITN reports have had no trouble obtaining regular access to the mainstream media in Britain, where they continue to make their case as though the 2000 court verdict simply didn't exist. Their freedom of speech has thus not been permanently infringed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=David|url=http://www.david-campbell.org/2009/11/14/chomskys-bosnian-shame/|title=Chomsky's Bosnian shame|date=14 November 2009|publisher=DavidCampbell.com.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Denial by officials==\nSimilar to [[Rwandan genocide denial]], [[Nanjing Massacre denial]], [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Armenian genocide denial]], revisionists and denialists often claim that the designation of genocide is result of international political conspiracy, which invoked violence in the first place, which is than further exaggerated or completely invented.

The ''LM'' defendants and Thomas Deichmann were properly represented at the trial and were able to lay out all the details of their claim that the ITN reporters had \"deliberately misrepresented\" the situation at Trnopolje. Having charged 'deliberate misrepresentation', they needed to prove 'deliberate misrepresentation'. To this end, the ''LM'' defendants were able to cross-examine Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, as well as every member of the ITN crews who were at the camps, along with other witnesses. (That they didn't take up the opportunity to cross-examine the Bosnian doctor imprisoned at Trnopolje, who featured in the ITN stories and was called to testify on the conditions he and others suffered, was perhaps the moment any remaining shred of credibility for ''LM''{{'}}s allegations evaporated). They were able to show the ITN reports to the court, including the rushes from which the final TV stories were edited, and conduct a forensic examination of the visuals they alleged were deceitful. And all of this took place in front of a jury of twelve citizens who they needed to convince about the truthfulness of their allegations.\n\nThey failed. The jury found unanimously against ''LM'' and awarded the maximum possible damages. So it was not ITN that bankrupted ''LM''. It was ''LM''{{'}}s lies about the ITN reports that bankrupted themselves, morally and financially. Despite their failure, those who lied about the ITN reports have had no trouble obtaining regular access to the mainstream media in Britain, where they continue to make their case as though the 2000 court verdict simply didn't exist. Their freedom of speech has thus not been permanently infringed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=David|url=http://www.david-campbell.org/2009/11/14/chomskys-bosnian-shame/|title=Chomsky's Bosnian shame|date=14 November 2009|publisher=DavidCampbell.com.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Denial by officials==\nSimilar to [[Rwandan genocide denial]], [[Nanjing Massacre denial]], [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Armenian genocide denial]], revisionists and denialists often claim that the designation of genocide is result of international political conspiracy, which invoked violence in the first place, which is than further exaggerated or completely invented.

They finished 15th in the final table to secure a 13th successive top flight campaign, although their final position was disappointing given their performance earlier in the season.\n\n==Season summary==\nDespite the early season sale of [[Dean Holdsworth]] to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] showed the \"[[Crazy Gang (football)|Crazy Gang]]\" spirit once more as they were still standing fourth at the beginning of December. Manager [[Joe Kinnear]] was hopeful that this could finally be the season when Wimbledon achieved a [[UEFA Cup]] place, but the team's form steadily deteriorated during the second half of the season. Their 15th-place finish was their worst since reaching the top flight in 1986, though they had never looked to be in any real danger of relegation.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1997\u201398 FA

He developed his guitar skills by emulating instrumental [[surf music]] bands such as [[the Shadows]], [[the Ventures]], [[the Astronauts (band)|the Astronauts]], and [[British Invasion]] artists including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]].\n\n==Musical career==\nAfter graduating from high school two years early at the age of 15, Mitchell joined local Vancouver pop-rockers \"William Tell & the Marksmen\", which later morphed into \"Paisley Rain\". Following that, Mitchell became a member of the [[psychedelic era]] band, the \"Seeds of Time\".<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seeds-of-time-mn0000936047</ref> During his tenure with the Seeds of Time, Mitchell toured and played with venerated bluesmen [[Willie Dixon]], [[Nick Oliveri]], and [[T-Bone Walker]], experiences which helped reinforce in Mitchell a deep-seated and lifelong love for the [[blues]].\n\n===Prism===\nIn 1973, Mitchell left the Seeds of Time to join guitarist/singer/songwriter [[Tom Lavin]] and his brother Jack as a member of the house band at Rohan's Rockpile, a live music venue in the [[Kitsilano]] neighborhood of Vancouver.<ref>https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/real-estate/illustrated-vancouver-vol-11-rohans-1923715</ref> Then, in 1975 Mitchell joined [[Bruce Fairbairn]]'s [[rhythm and blues]] band \"Sunshyne\", after being recruited to assist in helping to transform their sound from [[jazz fusion]] into [[blues rock]].<ref>http://pnwbands.com/sunshyne.html</ref> To maximize the chances of securing a record deal, Mitchell voluntarily withdrew as lead vocalist and was replaced by Ron Tabak, who previously fronted the band \"Not Fragile\". The project was renamed Prism, and their [[Prism (Prism album)|self-titled debut]] album was released on the GRT label in 1977. The album achieved platinum status in Canada, a first for a debut Canadian artist. Although drummer [[Jim Vallance]] was initially the principal songwriter for Prism, Mitchell assumed the role after Vallance departed Prism in 1978 and was replaced by former Seeds of Time drummer, Rocket Norton. Mitchell went on to compose and co-compose numerous Prism hit songs, including \"Armageddon\", the title track for the third album and one of the band's most recognizable songs.

He developed his guitar skills by emulating instrumental [[surf music]] bands such as [[the Shadows]], [[the Ventures]], [[the Astronauts (band)|the Astronauts]], and [[British Invasion]] artists including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]].\n\n==Musical career==\nAfter graduating from high school two years early at the age of 15, Mitchell joined local Vancouver pop-rockers \"William Tell & the Marksmen\", which later morphed into \"Paisley Rain\". Following that, Mitchell became a member of the [[psychedelic era]] band, the \"Seeds of Time\".<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seeds-of-time-mn0000936047</ref> During his tenure with the Seeds of Time, Mitchell toured and played with venerated bluesmen [[Willie Dixon]], [[Nick Oliveri]], and [[T-Bone Walker]], experiences which helped reinforce in Mitchell a deep-seated and lifelong love for the [[blues]].\n\n===Prism===\nIn 1973, Mitchell left the Seeds of Time to join guitarist/singer/songwriter [[Tom Lavin]] and his brother Jack as a member of the house band at Rohan's Rockpile, a live music venue in the [[Kitsilano]] neighborhood of Vancouver.<ref>https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/real-estate/illustrated-vancouver-vol-11-rohans-1923715</ref> Then, in 1975 Mitchell joined [[Bruce Fairbairn]]'s [[rhythm and blues]] band \"Sunshyne\", after being recruited to assist in helping to transform their sound from [[jazz fusion]] into [[blues rock]].<ref>http://pnwbands.com/sunshyne.html</ref> To maximize the chances of securing a record deal, Mitchell voluntarily withdrew as lead vocalist and was replaced by Ron Tabak, who previously fronted the band \"Not Fragile\".

The season marked 20 years since Wimbledon's election to the Football League and was their eleventh successive season of top division football. It was one of the most successful of the club's history as they finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups.\n\n==Season summary==\nThe opening day of the season saw Wimbledon lose 3-0 at home to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a game mostly remembered for [[David Beckham]]'s late goal from inside his own half. The Dons also lost their next two games, but then went on a 19-match unbeaten run, including seven league wins in a row. A 1-0 over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in December left them 3rd in the table, one point behind leaders Arsenal. The team's form tailed off in the second half of the season and they missed out on the chance of European qualification, finishing 8th. \n\nWimbledon also reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups. Their FA Cup run saw them knock out holders Manchester United but they lost 3-0 to the eventual winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Highbury]]. In the League Cup they were eliminated on away goals by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], who also went on to win the trophy. The sale of [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the end of the season left manager [[Joe Kinnear]] with a big hole to fill in a squad which had, so far, achieved so much on a shoestring budget.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1996\u201397 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1996\u201397 FA Premier League|showteam=WDN}}\n\n;Results

The season marked 20 years since Wimbledon's election to the Football League and was their eleventh successive season of top division football. It was one of the most successful of the club's history as they finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups.\n\n==Season summary==\nThe opening day of the season saw Wimbledon lose 3-0 at home to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a game mostly remembered for [[David Beckham]]'s late goal from inside his own half. The Dons also lost their next two games, but then went on a 19-match unbeaten run, including seven league wins in a row. A 1-0 over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in December left them 3rd in the table, one point behind leaders Arsenal. The team's form tailed off in the second half of the season and they missed out on the chance of European qualification, finishing 8th. \n\nWimbledon also reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups. Their FA Cup run saw them knock out holders Manchester United but they lost 3-0 to the eventual winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Highbury]]. In the League Cup they were eliminated on away goals by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], who also went on to win the trophy. The sale of [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the end of the season left manager [[Joe Kinnear]] with a big hole to fill in a squad which had, so far, achieved so much on a shoestring budget.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1996\u201397 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1996\u201397 FA Premier League|showteam=WDN}}\n\n;Results

The 2nd Louisiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment surrendered on 9 April 1865 at Appomattox, VA, with the Army of Northern Virginia; the 3d Louisiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment disbanded on 20 May 1865 at Shreveport, LA.\n\nThe 2nd and 3rd Louisiana Volunteer Infantry Regiments reconstituted on 30 March 1878 as the Special Militia Force to include separate companies and battalions outside Orleans Parish; its elements organized between 1878-1890 embracing fifteen companies by 1890. They were reorganized in part on 26 December 1891 as the 1st and 2nd Battalions of Infantry and transferred to the Louisiana State National Guard. The battalions consolidated on 17 March 1896 to form the 1st Regiment of Infantry with headquarters at Baton Rouge.\n\nThe unit was mustered into federal service between 8\u201318 May 1898 at New Orleans as the 1st Louisiana Volunteer Infantry and mustered out of federal service on 3 October 1898 at Jacksonville, FL. It was reorganized on 8 August 1899 in the Louisiana State National Guard as the 1st Battalion of Infantry with headquarters at Monroe.

Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]].

It ranges from sandy [[dunes]] dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large [[Taxodium|bald cypress]] near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Region]], and [[pine]] groves in the [[List of mountains in Maryland|Maryland mountains]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Deep Creek Lake Maryland Panoramic View.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Western Maryland is known for its heavily forested mountains.

The mid-portion of this border is interrupted by [[District of Columbia]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including the town of [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown, Maryland]]. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. (The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], however Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). The [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the ''[[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]]''.\n[[File:Patapsco fg01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Typical freshwater river above the tidal zone.

Wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.\n\nInto the 18th century, individual priests and lay leaders claimed Maryland farms belonging to the Jesuits as personal property and [[bequest|bequeathed]] them in order to evade the legal restrictions on religious organizations' owning property.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Border disputes (1681\u20131760)===\n\n{{main|Penn\u2013Calvert Boundary Dispute|Cresap's War}}\n\nThe royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the [[Potomac River]] up to the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]].

The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the grant indicated that Charles II and [[William Penn]] assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to [[New Castle, Delaware]] when it falls north of [[Philadelphia]], the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city.

The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nNegotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760.

It also became the seventh state admitted to the Union after ratifying the new federal Constitution in 1788. In December 1790, Maryland donated land selected by first President [[George Washington]] to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of [[Washington, D.C.]] The land was provided along the north shore of the [[Potomac River]] from [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties, as well as from [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] on the south shore of the Potomac in [[Virginia]]; however, the land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the [[District of Columbia retrocession]] in 1846.\n\n===19th century===\n\n{{original research|section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Ft.

In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name=\"tuck\"/>\n\nThe Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.

In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]].

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

The [[Maryland Transit Administration]] (often abbreviated as \"MTA Maryland\"), a state agency part of the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] also provides transit services within the state. Headquartered in Baltimore, MTA's transit services are largely focused on central Maryland, as well as some portions of the Eastern Shore and Southern MD. Baltimore's [[Baltimore Light RailLink|Light RailLink]] and [[Baltimore Metro SubwayLink|Metro SubwayLink]] systems serve its densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The MTA also serves the city and its suburbs with its [[MTA Maryland bus service|local bus]] service (the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|9th largest system]] in the nation). The MTA's [[Maryland Transit Administration#Commuter bus|Commuter Bus]] system provides express coach service on longer routes connecting Washington D.C. and Baltimore to parts of Central and Southern MD as well as the Eastern Shore.

The government of Maryland, like the other 49 [[Politics of the United States#State government|state governments]], has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]].\n\nPower in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]]. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] is composed of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] and the [[Maryland Senate]]. [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland's governor]] is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. The legislature may not increase the governor's proposed budget expenditures. Unlike many other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's [[County (United States)|counties]].\n\nMost of the business of government is conducted in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]. Elections for governor and most statewide offices, as well as most county elections, are held in [[United States midterm election|midterm-election years]] (even-numbered years not divisible by four).\n\nThe judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the [[Maryland Court of Special Appeals|Court of Special Appeals]] and the [[state supreme court]] is the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]].

Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]], centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants, penal labor, and African slaves. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and by 1776 its delegates signed the [[Declaration of Independence (U.S.)|Declaration of Independence]]. Many of its citizens subsequently played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles in the war]]. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAlthough then a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], its strategic location giving it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant role in the conflict]].

Nearly half the black population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Whites did impose [[racial segregation]] in public facilities and [[Jim Crow]] laws, which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\n\nBaltimore grew significantly during the [[Industrial Revolution]], due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections, attracting European immigrant labor. Many manufacturing businesses were established in the Baltimore area after the Civil War. Baltimore businessmen, including [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]], founded notable city institutions that bear their names, including a university, library, music school and art museum.\n\nCumberland was Maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century.

In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated [[primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns.<ref name=\"tuck\"/> Disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name=\"tuck\"/>\n\nThe Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902 the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\n\nThe [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.\n[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|Ruin left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]]]\nWith the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.\n\nAfter Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H.

Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington DC and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns.

Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\n\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{See also|List of counties in Maryland|List of incorporated places in Maryland|List of census-designated places in Maryland}}\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 319728\n|1800= 341548\n|1810= 380546\n|1820= 407350\n|1830= 447040\n|1840= 470019\n|1850= 583034\n|1860= 687049\n|1870= 780894\n|1880= 934943\n|1890= 1042390\n|1900= 1188044\n|1910= 1295346\n|1920= 1449661\n|1930= 1631526\n|1940= 1821244\n|1950= 2343001\n|1960= 3100689\n|1970= 3922399\n|1980= 4216975\n|1990= 4781468\n|2000= 5296486\n|2010= 5773552\n|estimate= 6045680\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census|publisher=2010.census.gov|accessdate=December 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011236/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy}}</ref><br>2018 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/md,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Maryland; United States|format=|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 7, 2019|accessdate=February 7, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:Map of maryland counties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland's counties]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year.

Data is sourced from the [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ 2014 ACS 5-year Estimate] report published by the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]].]]\n\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's close proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]] with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area. Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.\n\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\n\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\n\n===Baltimore port===\n\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the [[Port of Baltimore]] and its related [[railroad|rail]] and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008.<ref>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center. New Orleans, LA.

The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a booming economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] is a {{convert|14|mi|km}} [[canal]] on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |place=Philadelphia, PA |url=http://www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/ChesapeakeDelawareCanal.aspx |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].\n\n[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of the state's economy.]]\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[muskmelon]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.\n\n===Biotechnology===\n\nMaryland is a major center for [[life sciences]] research and development.

The [[Maryland Transit Administration]] (often abbreviated as \"MTA Maryland\"), a state agency part of the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] also provides transit services within the state. Headquartered in Baltimore, MTA's transit services are largely focused on central Maryland, as well as some portions of the Eastern Shore and Southern MD. Baltimore's [[Baltimore Light RailLink|Light RailLink]] and [[Baltimore Metro SubwayLink|Metro SubwayLink]] systems serve its densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The MTA also serves the city and its suburbs with its [[MTA Maryland bus service|local bus]] service (the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|9th largest system]] in the nation). The MTA's [[Maryland Transit Administration#Commuter bus|Commuter Bus]] system provides express coach service on longer routes connecting Washington D.C. and Baltimore to parts of Central and Southern MD as well as the Eastern Shore.

The government of Maryland, like the other 49 [[Politics of the United States#State government|state governments]], has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]].\n\nPower in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]]. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] is composed of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] and the [[Maryland Senate]]. [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland's governor]] is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. The legislature may not increase the governor's proposed budget expenditures. Unlike many other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's [[County (United States)|counties]].\n\nMost of the business of government is conducted in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]. Elections for governor and most statewide offices, as well as most county elections, are held in [[United States midterm election|midterm-election years]] (even-numbered years not divisible by four).\n\nThe judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the [[Maryland Court of Special Appeals|Court of Special Appeals]] and the [[state supreme court]] is the [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]].
