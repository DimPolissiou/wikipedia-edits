It was Louise \u00c9lisabeth who presented [[Madame de Pompadour]] to the court of King [[Louis XV of France]]. Louise \u00c9lisabeth was the [[Duke of \u00c9tampes|Duchess of \u00c9tampes]] in her own right, having succeeded to the title at the death of her aunt, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1678\u20131718)|Marie Anne de Bourbon, Dowager Duchess of Vend\u00f4me]]. The county of [[Sancerre]], previously held by her brother [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri I, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], also became her property in 1740 at his death.\n\n==Biography==\nLouise \u00c9lisabeth was born on 22 November 1693, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. As a member of the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]], she was a ''[[prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''. In youth, she was known at court as ''Mademoiselle de Charolais'',<ref>[http://enviedhistoire.canalblog.com/albums/princesses_de_conde__petites_filles_de_louis_xiv/photos/5407874-louise_elisabeth.html  Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon]</ref> a style later borne by her younger sister. Her parents' second daughter, and third child, she was one of nine children. She was baptised in the chapel of Versailles on 24 November 1698 with her brother Louis Henri and her sister Louise Anne.\n\n===Marriage===\nAt the age of seventeen, it was suggested by her ambitious mother that she marry one of the king's grandsons, the young [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Duke of Berry]]. The marriage, however, did not take place due to the machinations of Louise \u00c9lisabeth's aunt, the [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon|Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]], who wanted the Duke for her own daughter, [[Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\nOn 9 July 1713, Louise \u00c9lisabeth married her first cousin [[Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti|Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], at Versailles. Her husband, who was three years younger than his bride, had become the Prince of Conti in 1709 upon the early death of his father [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]]. His mother was the pious [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]], eldest granddaughter of ''[[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Le Grand Cond\u00e9]]''.\n\nHer marriage was part of a double wedding between the Cond\u00e9 and Conti branches of the House of Bourbon; Louise \u00c9lisabeth's older brother [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri de Bourbon]] married ''Mademoiselle de Conti'', [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1689\u20131720)|Marie Anne de Bourbon-Conti]]. The ceremony took place in the newly built [[Chapels of Versailles|Royal Chapel of Versailles]].\n\nPresent at the wedding were her mother, paternal grandmother the [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Princess Palatine Anne, Dowager Princess of Cond\u00e9]]; [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]], and his wife [[Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans]], her uncles [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine]], [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse]] and [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], as well as her aunts [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon|Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]], and the two widowed Princesses of Conti, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon]] and [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]].<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-hypotheses-1999-1-page-207.htm LE FONCTIONNEMENT DE LA COUR DE VERSAILLES]</ref>\n\nIn August 1716, at the age of twenty-two, Louise \u00c9lisabeth contracted [[smallpox]] from her husband, whom she had been nursing through his illness. A year later she gave birth to her first child. She and her husband had five children.\n\nThe [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Princess Palatine Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]] (''Madame''), sister in law of Louis XIV and famous memoir writer, wrote of Louise \u00c9lisabeth circa 1719:\n\n{{quote|She is a person full of charms, and a striking proof that grace is preferable to beauty. When she chooses to make herself agreeable, it is impossible to resist her. Her manners are most fascinating; she is full of gentleness, never displaying the least ill-humour, and always saying something kind and obliging. It is greatly to be regretted that she is not in the society of more virtuous persons, for she is herself naturally very good; but she is spoiled by bad company. She has an ugly fool for her husband, who has been badly brought up; and the examples which are constantly before her eyes are so pernicious that they have corrupted her and made her careless of her reputation. Her amiable, unaffected manners are highly delightful to foreigners. Among others, some Bavarians have fallen in love with her, as well as the [[Prince Rackoczy|Prince Ragotzky]]; but she disgusted him with her coquetry.\n<br />\n..she does not love her husband, and cannot do so, no less on account of his ugly person than for his bad temper. It is not only his face that is hideous, but his whole person is frightful and deformed. She terrified him by placing some muskets and swords near her bed, and assuring him that if he came there again with his pistols charged, she would take the gun and fire upon him, and if she missed, she would fall upon him with the sword. Since this time he has left off carrying his pistols.''<ref>[http://www.public-domain-content.com/books/Louis14/C31P1.shtml Memoirs of the Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans during the Regency; ''Consort of Louis-Armand'']</ref>}}\n\nLouise \u00c9lisabeth had several extramarital affairs, such as her liaison with the handsome [[Philippe Charles de La Fare]].<ref>La Fare was often assumed to have been the father of her son.</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} These infidelities incensed her husband, whose jealousy made him turn physically violent against his wife. He is reported to have hurt his wife to the point that she had to see a doctor on two separate occasions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} After a particularly dramatic scene in the Conti household, the princess refused to live with her husband anymore and took refuge with her mother. Later she fled to a convent. According to Saint-Simon, she once said of her husband:\n\n<blockquote>\nhe could not make a ''[[prince du sang]]'' without her, while she could make one without him.<ref>\u00abqu'il ne pouvait pas faire un prince du sang sans elle, au lieu qu'elle en pouvait faire sans lui\u00bb.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first years of her marriage were full of court cases at the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]'' against her husband due to his violent temper and her desire to leave him.<ref>Memoirs of Saint Simon</ref> In 1725, she consented to return to the Prince of Conti, who had her confined to the ''Ch\u00e2teau de l'Isle-Adam''.<ref>[[L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise|L'Isle-Adam]], in the modern-day [[Val d'Oise]] department of France, approximately twenty-five kilometers NNW of Paris</ref> She was able later, however, to convince him to allow her to return to Paris in order to give birth to her daughter, Louise Henriette. Her husband died a year later.\n\nDue to his open support of the Scottish economist [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] who had implemented the introduction of ''paper money'' to France during the ''[[R\u00e9gence]]'' of the young King [[Louis XV of France]], her husband had made a fortune.\n\n[[Image:Posthumous Oil on canvas portrait of Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon (1693-1775).jpg|200px|thumb|right|A posthumous painting of Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]\n\nHer husband died in 1727 at the [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (quai Conti)]] in Paris due to a \"chest swelling\". Louise \u00c9lisabeth was known at court either as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti troisi\u00e8me'' or ''Madame la Princesse de Conti derni\u00e8re douairi\u00e8re'', in order to distinguish Louise \u00c9lisabeth from the other two widowed princesses of Conti still alive:\n*[[Marie Anne de Bourbon]] (1666\u20131739), the legitimised daughter of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]] and wife of [[Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti|Louis Armand I de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]]. She was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti premi\u00e8re douairi\u00e8re'' as she was the first to be widowed in 1685. Her husband's Conti title fell upon his younger brother, [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti|Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]].\n*[[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]] (1666\u20131732), the wife of Fran\u00e7ois Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti and Louise \u00c9lisabeth's mother-in-law. She was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti seconde douairi\u00e8re'' after losing her husband in 1709.\n\n[[File:The grounds of the H\u00f4tel de Conti (built by Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon, present H\u00f4tel de Brienne) from the Turgot map of Paris circa 1737.png|thumb|left|The [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (rue Saint-Dominique)]] on the 1739 [[Turgot map of Paris]] ]]\n\nIn 1733 Louise \u00c9lisabeth purchased a townhouse with an extensive garden on the rue Saint-Dominique in Paris from [[Fran\u00e7oise de Mailly]] (widow of [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, Marquis de La Vrilli\u00e8re]]), and hired the architect Nicolas Simonnet to redecorate the interiors. At that time it also became known as the [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (rue Saint-Dominique)|H\u00f4tel de Conti]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jWzAAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 Lehrer 2013, pp. 85\u201387], in ''Wartime Sites in Paris''. New York: SF Tafel Publishers. {{ISBN|9781492292920}}.</ref> It is shown on the 1739 [[Turgot map of Paris]] as \"H. de Conty\".\n\nThe Dowager Princess and her aunt the Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans joined forces in 1743 to arrange the marriage of her son to her first cousin, [[Louise Diane d'Orl\u00e9ans]], and that of her daughter to Louise Diane's nephew, the heir to the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]]. This helped to somewhat smooth over the century-long feud between the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Cond\u00e9]] and [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]], a feud fueled by the animosity between Louise \u00c9lisabeth's mother and aunt, the Princess of Cond\u00e9 and the Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, both legitimised daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.\n\nAfter the death of her mother in June 1743, she acquired the ''[[ch\u00e2teau de Louveciennes]]'', which later reverted to the Crown. Louis XV in turn gave it to the successor of Madame de Pompadour, [[Madame du Barry]]. The Dowager Princess of Conti later also acquired the ''ch\u00e2teau de Voisins''.\n\nLater, in 1746, the Dowager Princess was asked by Louis XV to present his new mistress, the future [[Madame de Pompadour]], at court. She attended the ball at Versailles in honour of the marriage of [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] to [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729\u20131765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] in 1745. According to [[Nancy Mitford]]'s Madame de Pompadour book, the proud Dowager Princess was annoyed at no one recognising her.<ref>Mitfod. Nancy, ''Madame de Pompadour'', Sphere, London, 1964, pg. 63</ref> She obliged the king in the hope that he would help her escape her debts, a tactic which worked.\n\nJust before her death, the princess gave her townhouse on the rue Saint-Dominique in Paris to her son, and she died there at the age of eighty-one, on 27 May 1775. She was buried at the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice, Paris|\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice]] in Paris. She had just sold the [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (rue Saint-Dominique)]] to her grandson [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois I de Bourbon, prince de Conti|Louis Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon-Conti]] who moved in <!-- not a mistake-->in the next year.<ref>Her grandson had a popular ''salon'' with his mistress, [[Marie-Charlotte Hippolyte de Campet de Saujon|Madame de Boufflers]]</ref>\n\n==Issue==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=20% | Name !! width=100px | Portrait !!

It was Louise \u00c9lisabeth who presented [[Madame de Pompadour]] to the court of King [[Louis XV of France]]. Louise \u00c9lisabeth was the [[Duke of \u00c9tampes|Duchess of \u00c9tampes]] in her own right, having succeeded to the title at the death of her aunt, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1678\u20131718)|Marie Anne de Bourbon, Dowager Duchess of Vend\u00f4me]].

As a member of the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]], she was a ''[[prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''. In youth, she was known at court as ''Mademoiselle de Charolais'',<ref>[http://enviedhistoire.canalblog.com/albums/princesses_de_conde__petites_filles_de_louis_xiv/photos/5407874-louise_elisabeth.html  Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon]</ref> a style later borne by her younger sister. Her parents' second daughter, and third child, she was one of nine children. She was baptised in the chapel of Versailles on 24 November 1698 with her brother Louis Henri and her sister Louise Anne.\n\n===Marriage===\nAt the age of seventeen, it was suggested by her ambitious mother that she marry one of the king's grandsons, the young [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Duke of Berry]]. The marriage, however, did not take place due to the machinations of Louise \u00c9lisabeth's aunt, the [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon|Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]], who wanted the Duke for her own daughter, [[Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\nOn 9 July 1713, Louise \u00c9lisabeth married her first cousin [[Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti|Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]], at Versailles. Her husband, who was three years younger than his bride, had become the Prince of Conti in 1709 upon the early death of his father [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]]. His mother was the pious [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]], eldest granddaughter of ''[[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Le Grand Cond\u00e9]]''.\n\nHer marriage was part of a double wedding between the Cond\u00e9 and Conti branches of the House of Bourbon; Louise \u00c9lisabeth's older brother [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri de Bourbon]] married ''Mademoiselle de Conti'', [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1689\u20131720)|Marie Anne de Bourbon-Conti]]. The ceremony took place in the newly built [[Chapels of Versailles|Royal Chapel of Versailles]].\n\nPresent at the wedding were her mother, paternal grandmother the [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Princess Palatine Anne, Dowager Princess of Cond\u00e9]]; [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686\u20131714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]], and his wife [[Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans]], her uncles [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine]], [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse]] and [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], as well as her aunts [[Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon|Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]], and the two widowed Princesses of Conti, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon]] and [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]].<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-hypotheses-1999-1-page-207.htm LE FONCTIONNEMENT DE LA COUR DE VERSAILLES]</ref>\n\nIn August 1716, at the age of twenty-two, Louise \u00c9lisabeth contracted [[smallpox]] from her husband, whom she had been nursing through his illness. A year later she gave birth to her first child. She and her husband had five children.\n\nThe [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Princess Palatine Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]] (''Madame''), sister in law of Louis XIV and famous memoir writer, wrote of Louise \u00c9lisabeth circa 1719:\n\n{{quote|She is a person full of charms, and a striking proof that grace is preferable to beauty. When she chooses to make herself agreeable, it is impossible to resist her. Her manners are most fascinating; she is full of gentleness, never displaying the least ill-humour, and always saying something kind and obliging. It is greatly to be regretted that she is not in the society of more virtuous persons, for she is herself naturally very good; but she is spoiled by bad company. She has an ugly fool for her husband, who has been badly brought up; and the examples which are constantly before her eyes are so pernicious that they have corrupted her and made her careless of her reputation. Her amiable, unaffected manners are highly delightful to foreigners. Among others, some Bavarians have fallen in love with her, as well as the [[Prince Rackoczy|Prince Ragotzky]]; but she disgusted him with her coquetry.\n<br />\n..she does not love her husband, and cannot do so, no less on account of his ugly person than for his bad temper. It is not only his face that is hideous, but his whole person is frightful and deformed. She terrified him by placing some muskets and swords near her bed, and assuring him that if he came there again with his pistols charged, she would take the gun and fire upon him, and if she missed, she would fall upon him with the sword. Since this time he has left off carrying his pistols.''<ref>[http://www.public-domain-content.com/books/Louis14/C31P1.shtml Memoirs of the Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans during the Regency; ''Consort of Louis-Armand'']</ref>}}\n\nLouise \u00c9lisabeth had several extramarital affairs, such as her liaison with the handsome [[Philippe Charles de La Fare]].<ref>La Fare was often assumed to have been the father of her son.</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} These infidelities incensed her husband, whose jealousy made him turn physically violent against his wife. He is reported to have hurt his wife to the point that she had to see a doctor on two separate occasions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} After a particularly dramatic scene in the Conti household, the princess refused to live with her husband anymore and took refuge with her mother. Later she fled to a convent. According to Saint-Simon, she once said of her husband:\n\n<blockquote>\nhe could not make a ''[[prince du sang]]'' without her, while she could make one without him.<ref>\u00abqu'il ne pouvait pas faire un prince du sang sans elle, au lieu qu'elle en pouvait faire sans lui\u00bb.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first years of her marriage were full of court cases at the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]'' against her husband due to his violent temper and her desire to leave him.<ref>Memoirs of Saint Simon</ref> In 1725, she consented to return to the Prince of Conti, who had her confined to the ''Ch\u00e2teau de l'Isle-Adam''.<ref>[[L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise|L'Isle-Adam]], in the modern-day [[Val d'Oise]] department of France, approximately twenty-five kilometers NNW of Paris</ref> She was able later, however, to convince him to allow her to return to Paris in order to give birth to her daughter, Louise Henriette. Her husband died a year later.\n\nDue to his open support of the Scottish economist [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] who had implemented the introduction of ''paper money'' to France during the ''[[R\u00e9gence]]'' of the young King [[Louis XV of France]], her husband had made a fortune.\n\n[[Image:Posthumous Oil on canvas portrait of Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon (1693-1775).jpg|200px|thumb|right|A posthumous painting of Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]\n\nHer husband died in 1727 at the the [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (quai Conti)]] in Paris due to a \"chest swelling\". Louise \u00c9lisabeth was known at court either as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti troisi\u00e8me'' or ''Madame la Princesse de Conti derni\u00e8re douairi\u00e8re'', in order to distinguish Louise \u00c9lisabeth from the other two widowed princesses of Conti still alive:\n*[[Marie Anne de Bourbon]] (1666\u20131739), the legitimised daughter of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]] and wife of [[Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti|Louis Armand I de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]]. She was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti premi\u00e8re douairi\u00e8re'' as she was the first to be widowed in 1685. Her husband's Conti title fell upon his younger brother, [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti|Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]].\n*[[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]] (1666\u20131732), the wife of Fran\u00e7ois Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti and Louise \u00c9lisabeth's mother-in-law. She was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti seconde douairi\u00e8re'' after losing her husband in 1709.\n\n[[File:The grounds of the H\u00f4tel de Conti (built by Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Bourbon, present H\u00f4tel de Brienne) from the Turgot map of Paris circa 1737.png|thumb|left|The [[H\u00f4tel de Conti (rue Saint-Dominique)]] on the 1739 [[Turgot map of Paris]] ]]\n\nIn 1733 Louise \u00c9lisabeth purchased a townhouse with an extensive garden on the rue Saint-Dominique in Paris from [[Fran\u00e7oise de Mailly]] (widow of [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, Marquis de La Vrilli\u00e8re]]), and hired the architect Nicolas Simonnet to redecorate the interiors.

This helped to somewhat smooth over the century-long feud between the [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|House of Cond\u00e9]] and [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]], a feud fueled by the animosity between Louise \u00c9lisabeth's mother and aunt, the Princess of Cond\u00e9 and the Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, both legitimised daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.\n\nAfter the death of her mother in June 1743, she acquired the ''[[ch\u00e2teau de Louveciennes]]'', which later reverted to the Crown. Louis XV in turn gave it to the successor of Madame de Pompadour, [[Madame du Barry]]. The Dowager Princess of Conti later also acquired the ''ch\u00e2teau de Voisins''.\n\nLater, in 1746, the Dowager Princess was asked by Louis XV to present his new mistress, the future [[Madame de Pompadour]], at court. She attended the ball at Versailles in honour of the marriage of [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] to [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729\u20131765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] in 1745. According to [[Nancy Mitford]]'s Madame de Pompadour book, the proud Dowager Princess was annoyed at no one recognising her.<ref>Mitfod. Nancy, ''Madame de Pompadour'', Sphere, London, 1964, pg. 63</ref> She obliged the king in the hope that he would help her escape her debts, a tactic which worked.\n\nJust before her death, the princess gave her townhouse on the rue Saint-Dominique in Paris to her son, and she died there at the age of eighty-one, on 27 May 1775. She was buried at the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice, Paris|\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice]] in Paris.

Halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have a fully oxidized C-7 carbon with only one indole nitrogen containing a \u03b2-glycosidic bond, while non-halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have both indole nitrogens glycosylated, and a fully reduced C-7 carbon.

Tryptophan is converted to an [[imine]] by enzyme StaO which is an L-amino acid oxidase (that may be FAD dependent). The imine is acted upon by StaD to form an uncharacterized intermediate proposed to be the dimerization product between 2 imine molecules. Chromopyrrolic acid is the molecule formed from this intermediate after the loss of VioE (used in the biosynthesis of violacein \u2013 a natural product formed from a branch point in this pathway that also diverges to form [[rebeccamycin]]. An aryl aryl coupling thought to be catalyzed by a [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P<sub>450</sub>]] enzyme to form an aromatic ring system occurs.<ref name=\"urldspace.mit.edu\"/>\n\n[[File:Staurosporine 2.png|500px|Staurosporine 2]]\n\nThis is followed by a [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] between the indole nitrogens resulting in cyclization and then [[decarboxylation]] assisted by StaC exclusively forming staurosporine aglycone or K252c. [[Glucose]] is transformed to NTP-L-ristoamine by StaA/B/E/J/I/K which is then added on to the staurosporine aglycone at 1 indole N by StaG. The StaN enzyme reorients the sugar by attaching it to the 2nd indole nitrogen into an unfavored conformation to form intermediated O-demethyl-N-demethyl-staurosporine. Lastly, O-methylation of the 4'amine by StaMA and N-methylation of the 3'-hydroxy by StaMB leads to the formation of staurosporine.<ref name=\"urldspace.mit.edu\"/>\n\n== Research in clinical use ==\nWhen encapsulated in [[liposome]] [[nanoparticle]], staurosporine is shown to suppress tumors ''in vivo'' in a mouse model without the toxic side effects which have prohibited its use as an anti-cancer drug with high apoptotic activity.  Researchers in [[UC San Diego Health System|UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center]] develop a platform technology of high drug-loading efficiency by manipulating the pH environment of the cells.  When injected into the mouse [[glioblastoma]] model, staurosporine is found to accumulate primarily in the tumor via [[fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] confirmation, and the mice did not suffer weight loss compared to the control mice administered with the free compound, an indicator of reduced toxicity.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2013-10-21-potent-anti-cancer-drug-delivered-in-liposomes.aspx|title=Study Identifies Safe Delivery System for Tricky Yet Highly Potent Anti-Cancer Compounds|author=News Release|publisher=UC San Diego Health System|date=21 October 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mukthavaram|first1=Rajesh|last2=Jiang|first2=Pengei|last3=Saklecha|first3=Rohit|last4=Simbery|first4=Dmitri|last5=Bharati|first5=Ila|last6=Nomura|first6=Natsuko|last7=Chao|first7=Ying|last8=Pastorino|first8=Sandra|title=High-efficiency liposomal encapsulation of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor leads to improved in vivo toxicity and tumor response profile|journal=[[International Journal of Nanomedicine]]|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3991\u20134006|year=2013|doi=10.2147/IJN.S51949|pmid=24174874|pmc=3808212}}</ref>\n\n== List of compounds closely related to Staurosporine ==\n* [[K252a]]\n* [[Stauprimide]]\n* [[Midostaurin]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Bacterial alkaloids]]\n[[Category:Antibiotics]]\n[[Category:Lactams]]\n[[Category:Protein kinase inhibitors]]\n[[Category:Indolocarbazoles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Drugbox\n| Verifiedfields = changed\n| verifiedrevid = 470470622\n| IUPAC_name = (''9S,10R,11R,13R'')-2,3,10,11,12,13-Hexahydro-<br/>10-methoxy-9-methyl-11-(methylamino)-9,13-epoxy-<br/>1''H'',9''H''-diindolo[1,2,3-gh:3',2',1'-lm]pyrrolo[3,4-j][1,7]<br/>benzodiazonin-1-one\n| image = Staurosporine.svg\n| width = 180px\n| image2 = Staurosporine molecule ball.png\n| alt2 = Ball-and-stick model of the staurosporine molecule\n| width2 = 220\n<!--Clinical data-->\n| tradename =  \n| pregnancy_AU = <!-- A / B1 / B2 / B3 / C / D / X -->\n| pregnancy_US = <!-- A / B            / C / D / X -->\n| pregnancy_category =  \n| legal_AU = <!-- Unscheduled / S2 / S3 / S4 / S5 / S6 / S7 / S8 / S9 -->\n| legal_CA = <!--             / Schedule I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII -->\n| legal_UK = <!-- GSL         / P       / POM / CD / Class A, B, C -->\n| legal_US = <!-- OTC                   / Rx-only  / Schedule I, II, III, IV, V -->\n| legal_status =  \n| routes_of_administration =\n<!--Pharmacokinetic data-->\n| bioavailability =  \n| protein_bound =  \n| metabolism =  \n| elimination_half-life =  \n| excretion =\n<!--Identifiers-->\n| CAS_number_Ref = {{cascite|correct|??}}\n| CAS_number = 62996-74-1\n| ATC_prefix = none\n| ATC_suffix =  \n| PubChem = 44259\n| IUPHAR_ligand = 346\n| DrugBank_Ref = {{drugbankcite|correct|drugbank}}\n| DrugBank = DB02010\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = 40272\n| ChEBI_Ref = {{ebicite|correct|EBI}}\n| ChEBI = 15738\n| ChEMBL_Ref = {{ebicite|changed|EBI}}\n| ChEMBL = 162\n| PDB_ligand = STU\n<!--Chemical data-->\n| C=28 | H=26 | N=4 | O=3\n| molecular_weight = 466.53 g/mol\n| smiles = C[C@@]12[C@@H]([C@@H](C[C@@H](O1)n3c4ccccc4c5c3c6n2c7ccccc7c6c8c5C(=O)NC8)NC)OC\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/C28H26N4O3/c1-28-26(34-3)17(29-2)12-20(35-28)31-18-10-6-4-8-14(18)22-23-16(13-30-27(23)33)21-15-9-5-7-11-19(15)32(28)25(21)24(22)31/h4-11,17,20,26,29H,12-13H2,1-3H3,(H,30,33)/t17-,20-,26-,28+/m1/s1\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = HKSZLNNOFSGOKW-FYTWVXJKSA-N\n}}\n\n'''Staurosporine''' (antibiotic AM-2282 or STS) is a [[natural product]] originally isolated in 1977 from the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces staurosporeus]]''.<ref name=\"omura\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Omura S, Iwai Y, Hirano A, Nakagawa A, Awaya J, Tsuchiya H, Takahashi Y, Masuma R |title= A new alkaloid AM-2282 of Streptomyces origin taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and preliminary characterization |journal= J.

Of these, Staurosporine falls within the most common subgroup, called Indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles. These fall into two classes - halogenated (chlorinated) and non-halogenated. Halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have a fully oxidized C-7 carbon with only one indole nitrogen containing a \u03b2-glycosidic bond, while non-halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have both indole nitrogens glycosylated, and a fully reduced C-7 carbon.

Tryptophan is converted to an [[imine]] by enzyme StaO which is an L-amino acid oxidase (that may be FAD dependent). The imine is acted upon by StaD to form an uncharacterized intermediate proposed to be the dimerization product between 2 imine molecules. Chromopyrrolic acid is the molecule formed from this intermediate after the loss of VioE (used in the biosynthesis of violacein \u2013 a natural product formed from a branch point in this pathway that also diverges to form [[rebeccamycin]].

The StaN enzyme reorients the sugar by attaching it to the 2nd indole nitrogen into an unfavored conformation to form intermediated O-demethyl-N-demethyl-staurosporine. Lastly, O-methylation of the 4'amine by StaMA and N-methylation of the 3'-hydroxy by StaMB leads to the formation of staurosporine.<ref name=\"urldspace.mit.edu\"/>\n\n== Research in clinical use ==\nWhen encapsulated in [[liposome]] [[nanoparticle]], staurosporine is shown to suppress tumors ''in vivo'' in a mouse model without the toxic side effects which have prohibited its use as an anti-cancer drug with high apoptotic activity.

The county has lost land in two places \u2013 to Staffordshire and Worcestershire.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10210367&c_id=10001043 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030212/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10210367&c_id=10001043 |date=1 October 2007 }} \u2013 Ancient county boundaries</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Shropshire is divisible into two distinct halves \u2013 north and south. The county has a highly diverse [[Geology of Shropshire|geology]]. The [[West Midlands Green Belt]] extends into eastern Shropshire, covering an area north from [[Highley]], to the east of Bridgnorth, north to the eastern side of Telford, leaving Shropshire eastwards alongside the A5. This encompasses [[Shifnal]], [[Cosford, Shropshire|Cosford]] and [[Albrighton, Bridgnorth|Albrighton]], and various other villages paralleling [[Dudley]] and Wolverhampton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmra.gov.uk/documents/WMRA%20Green%20belt%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111220941/http://www.wmra.gov.uk/documents/WMRA%20Green%20belt%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===North Shropshire===\n[[File:Welsh Bridge, Shrewsbury.jpg|thumb|left|[[River Severn]], seen here in [[Shrewsbury]], is the primary watercourse in the county.]]\nThe North Shropshire Plain is an extension of the flat and fertile [[Cheshire Plain]]. It is here that most of the county's large towns, and population, are to be found. [[Shrewsbury]] at the centre, [[Oswestry]] to the north west, [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] to the north, [[Market Drayton]] to the north east, and [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]] and the Telford conurbation (Telford, [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] and Shifnal) to the east. The land is fertile and agriculture remains a major feature of the landscape and the economy. The [[River Severn]] runs through the lower half of this area (from Wales in the west, eastwards), through Shrewsbury and down the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], before heading south to [[Bridgnorth]].\n\nThe area around [[Oswestry]] has more rugged geography than the North Shropshire Plain and the western half is over an extension of the [[Wrexham]] Coalfield and there are also copper deposits on the border with [[Wales]]. Mining of stone and sand [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] is still going on in [[Shrewsbury and Atcham|Mid-Shropshire]], notably on [[Haughmond Hill]], near [[Bayston Hill]], and around the village of [[Condover]]. Lead mining also took place at [[Snailbeach]] and the [[Stiperstones]], but this has now ceased. Other primary industries, such as forestry and fishing, are to be found too.\n\n[[File:Rhekin by Wrodian.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Wrekin]] is a prominent geographical feature located in the east of the county.]]\nThe [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] and [[M54 motorway|M54]] run from [[Wolverhampton]] (to the east of the county) across to Telford, around Shrewsbury parallel to the line of [[Watling Street]], an [[ancient trackway]]. The A5 then turns north west to Oswestry, before heading north into Wales in the Wrexham area. This is an important artery and the corridor is where most of Shropshire's modern commerce and industry is found, notably in Telford new town. There are also a number of railway lines crossing over the area, which centre at Shrewsbury. To the south west of Telford, near the Ironbridge Gorge, is [[Ironbridge Power Station]].\n\nThe new town of Telford is built partly on a former industrial area centred on the [[East Shropshire Coalfield]] as well as on former agricultural land. There are still many ex-colliery sites to be found in the area, as well as disused mine shafts. This industrial heritage is an important tourist attraction, as is seen by the growth of museums in the [[Ironbridge]], [[Coalbrookdale]], [[Broseley]] and [[Jackfield]] area. [[Blists Hill]] museum and historical ([[Victorian era]]) village is a major tourist attraction as well as the Iron Bridge itself. In addition, [[Telford Steam Railway]] runs from [[Horsehay]].\n\n===South Shropshire===\n:''For information specifically on the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], see '''[[Shropshire Hills AONB]]'''''.\n\n[[File:St Leonard's, Bridgnorth, Shropshire.JPG|thumb|left|St Leonard's Church is a prominent historical landmark in Bridgnorth.]]\nSouth Shropshire is more rural, with fewer settlements and no large towns, and its landscape differs greatly from that of North Shropshire. The area is dominated by significant hill ranges and river valleys, woods, pine forests and \"batches\", a colloquial term for small valleys and other natural features. Farming is more pastoral than the arable found in the north of the county. The only substantial towns are [[Bridgnorth]], with a population of around 12,000 people, [[Ludlow]] and [[Church Stretton]]. The [[Shropshire Hills AONB]] is located in the south-west, covering an area of {{convert|312|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}; it forms the only specifically protected area of the county. Inside this area is the popular [[Long Mynd]], a large plateau of {{convert|1693|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} and [[Stiperstones]] {{convert|1759|ft|m|order=flip}} high to the East of the [[Long Mynd]], overlooking [[Church Stretton]].\n\n[[File:A frosty Ludlow.jpg|thumb|right|The skyline of [[Ludlow]], one of south Shropshire's market towns, dominated by its sizeable castle and church.]]\nThe [[A49 road|A49]] is the main road through the area, running north to south, from Shrewsbury to [[Herefordshire]]. A railway line runs through the area on the same route as the A49 with stations at Church Stretton, [[Craven Arms]] and Ludlow. The steam heritage [[Severn Valley Railway]] runs from Bridgnorth into [[Worcestershire]] along the [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]], terminating at [[Kidderminster Town]].\n\nBecause of its valley location and character, Church Stretton is sometimes referred to<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shropshiretourism.co.uk/town/church-stretton.html|title=Map of Church Stretton - Accommodation, Shops and More|last=Tourism|first=Shropshire|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref> as ''[[Little Switzerland (landscape)|Little Switzerland]]''. Nearby are the old mining and quarrying communities on the [[Clee Hills]], notable geological features in the [[River Onny|Onny Valley]] and [[Wenlock Edge]] and fertile farmland in the [[Corve Dale]].

[[Telford]] is the largest town in the county with a population of 138,241 (which is approximately 30% of the total Salopian populace); whereas the [[county town]] of [[Shrewsbury]] has a lower, but still sizeable population of 71,715 (15%). The other sizeable towns are [[Oswestry]], [[Bridgnorth]], [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]] and [[Ludlow]]. The historic town of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] now makes up part of the Telford conurbation. The majority of the other settlements can be classed as villages or small towns such as [[Much Wenlock]]. Several villages have larger populations than the smallest town, [[Clun]]. The largest of these, [[Bayston Hill]], is the 10th most inhabited settlement in the county.   The names of several villages close to the border are of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] origin, such as [[Gobowen]] and [[Selattyn]].\n\nThe larger settlements are primarily concentrated in a central belt that roughly follows the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]/[[M54 motorway|M54]] roadway.

There was a two-tier system of local government, constituting a [[county council]] (as the upper tier) and six [[non-metropolitan district|district]] councils \u2013 [[Bridgnorth (district)|Bridgnorth]], [[North Shropshire]], [[Oswestry (borough)|Oswestry]], [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]], [[South Shropshire]] and [[Telford and Wrekin|The Wrekin]]. In 1998 The Wrekin became a [[unitary authority]], administratively separate from the county council, and became Telford and Wrekin. The two-tier structure remained in the remainder of the county and was the least populated two-tier area in England.\n\nOswestry and Shrewsbury & Atcham were each granted borough status in 1974. Telford and Wrekin became a borough in 2002.\n\n===2009 restructuring===\n{{See also|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\n[[File:Shirehall and Lord Hill Column.JPG|left|thumb|Shropshire's [[Shirehall, Shrewsbury|Shirehall]] is located opposite [[Lord Hill's Column]].]]\nIn 2006 a local government white paper supported proposals for new [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] to be set up in England in certain areas. Existing [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] with small populations, such as [[Cornwall]], Northumberland and Shropshire, were favoured by the government to be covered by unitary authorities in one form or another (the county either becoming a single unitary authority, or be broken into a number of unitary authorities). For the counties in the 2009 reorganisation, existing unitary authority areas within the counties' [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial boundaries]] (such as Telford and Wrekin) were not to be affected and no boundary changes were planned.\n\nShropshire County Council, supported by South Shropshire District Council and Oswestry Borough Council, proposed to the government that the non-metropolitan county of Shropshire become a single unitary authority. This was opposed by the other 3 districts in the county, with Shrewsbury & Atcham Borough Council taking their objection to the High Court in a judicial review.\n\nThe proposal to create a Shropshire unitary authority, covering the area of the existing non-metropolitan county, was supported by the [[Department of Communities and Local Government|DCLG]] and 1 April 2009 was set as the date for the re-organisation to take place. The first elections to Shropshire Council took place on 4 June 2009, with the former Shropshire County Council being the continuing authority and its councillors became the first members of the new Shropshire Council on 1 April.\n\nPart of the proposals include [[civil parish|parishing]] and establishing a [[town council]] for Shrewsbury. The parish was created on 13 May 2008 and is the second most populous [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in England (only [[Weston-super-Mare]] has a greater population) with a population of over 70,000.\n\n===Political control of councils===\nShropshire Council has been under Conservative control since the first election held in 2009; [[Telford and Wrekin Council]] has been under [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] control since 2011.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Montgomery Canal at Maesbury Marsh.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Montgomery Canal]] at [[Maesbury Marsh]].]]\n{{See also|Railways of Shropshire}}\n[[File:82109 - Shrewsbury (8959190070).jpg|thumb|The direct [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] from [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]] to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] with a [[Driving Van Trailer|DVT]] and mailbags delivering the [[Royal Mail]] at a time when [[British Rail]] ran the network.]]\nShropshire is connected to the rest of the United Kingdom via a number of road and rail links.

In northern Shropshire three canals with a total navigable length of {{convert|41|mi|km}} are managed by the [[Canal & River Trust]]: the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] (from north of [[Adderley]] to near [[Knighton, Stafford, Staffordshire|Knighton]]), the [[Llangollen Canal]] (from [[Chirk Aqueduct]] to [[Grindley Brook]]) and the [[Montgomery Canal]] (from its beginning at [[Frankton Junction]] to [[Llanymynech]]).

The county has lost land in two places \u2013 to Staffordshire and Worcestershire.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10210367&c_id=10001043 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030212/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10210367&c_id=10001043 |date=1 October 2007 }} \u2013 Ancient county boundaries</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Shropshire is divisible into two distinct halves \u2013 north and south. The county has a highly diverse [[Geology of Shropshire|geology]]. The [[West Midlands Green Belt]] extends into eastern Shropshire, covering an area north from [[Highley]], to the east of Bridgnorth, north to the eastern side of Telford, leaving Shropshire eastwards alongside the A5. This encompasses [[Shifnal]], [[Cosford, Shropshire|Cosford]] and [[Albrighton, Bridgnorth|Albrighton]], and various other villages paralleling [[Dudley]] and Wolverhampton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmra.gov.uk/documents/WMRA%20Green%20belt%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111220941/http://www.wmra.gov.uk/documents/WMRA%20Green%20belt%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===North Shropshire===\n[[File:Welsh Bridge, Shrewsbury.jpg|thumb|left|[[River Severn]], seen here in [[Shrewsbury]], is the primary watercourse in the county.]]\nThe North Shropshire Plain is an extension of the flat and fertile [[Cheshire Plain]]. It is here that most of the county's large towns, and population, are to be found. [[Shrewsbury]] at the centre, [[Oswestry]] to the north west, [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] to the north, [[Market Drayton]] to the north east, and [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]] and the Telford conurbation (Telford, [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Donnington, Telford|Donnington]] and Shifnal) to the east. The land is fertile and agriculture remains a major feature of the landscape and the economy. The [[River Severn]] runs through the lower half of this area (from Wales in the west, eastwards), through Shrewsbury and down the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], before heading south to [[Bridgnorth]].\n\nThe area around [[Oswestry]] has more rugged geography than the North Shropshire Plain and the western half is over an extension of the [[Wrexham]] Coalfield and there are also copper deposits on the border with [[Wales]]. Mining of stone and sand [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] is still going on in [[Shrewsbury and Atcham|Mid-Shropshire]], notably on [[Haughmond Hill]], near [[Bayston Hill]], and around the village of [[Condover]]. Lead mining also took place at [[Snailbeach]] and the [[Stiperstones]], but this has now ceased. Other primary industries, such as forestry and fishing, are to be found too.\n\n[[File:Rhekin by Wrodian.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Wrekin]] is a prominent geographical feature located in the east of the county.]]\nThe [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] and [[M54 motorway|M54]] run from [[Wolverhampton]] (to the east of the county) across to Telford, around Shrewsbury parallel to the line of [[Watling Street]], an [[ancient trackway]]. The A5 then turns north west to Oswestry, before heading north into Wales in the Wrexham area. This is an important artery and the corridor is where most of Shropshire's modern commerce and industry is found, notably in Telford new town. There are also a number of railway lines crossing over the area, which centre at Shrewsbury. To the south west of Telford, near the Ironbridge Gorge, is [[Ironbridge Power Station]].\n\nThe new town of Telford is built partly on a former industrial area centred on the [[East Shropshire Coalfield]] as well as on former agricultural land. There are still many ex-colliery sites to be found in the area, as well as disused mine shafts. This industrial heritage is an important tourist attraction, as is seen by the growth of museums in the [[Ironbridge]], [[Coalbrookdale]], [[Broseley]] and [[Jackfield]] area. [[Blists Hill]] museum and historical ([[Victorian era]]) village is a major tourist attraction as well as the Iron Bridge itself. In addition, [[Telford Steam Railway]] runs from [[Horsehay]].\n\n===South Shropshire===\n:''For information specifically on the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], see '''[[Shropshire Hills AONB]]'''''.\n\n[[File:St Leonard's, Bridgnorth, Shropshire.JPG|thumb|left|St Leonard's Church is a prominent historical landmark in Bridgnorth.]]\nSouth Shropshire is more rural, with fewer settlements and no large towns, and its landscape differs greatly from that of North Shropshire. The area is dominated by significant hill ranges and river valleys, woods, pine forests and \"batches\", a colloquial term for small valleys and other natural features. Farming is more pastoral than the arable found in the north of the county. The only substantial towns are [[Bridgnorth]], with a population of around 12,000 people, [[Ludlow]] and [[Church Stretton]]. The [[Shropshire Hills AONB]] is located in the south-west, covering an area of {{convert|312|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}; it forms the only specifically protected area of the county. Inside this area is the popular [[Long Mynd]], a large plateau of {{convert|1693|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} and [[Stiperstones]] {{convert|1759|ft|m|order=flip}} high to the East of the [[Long Mynd]], overlooking [[Church Stretton]].\n\n[[File:A frosty Ludlow.jpg|thumb|right|The skyline of [[Ludlow]], one of south Shropshire's market towns, dominated by its sizeable castle and church.]]\nThe [[A49 road|A49]] is the main road through the area, running north to south, from Shrewsbury to [[Herefordshire]]. A railway line runs through the area on the same route as the A49 with stations at Church Stretton, [[Craven Arms]] and Ludlow. The steam heritage [[Severn Valley Railway]] runs from Bridgnorth into [[Worcestershire]] along the [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]], terminating at [[Kidderminster Town]].\n\nBecause of its valley location and character, Church Stretton is sometimes referred to<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shropshiretourism.co.uk/town/church-stretton.html|title=Map of Church Stretton - Accommodation, Shops and More|last=Tourism|first=Shropshire|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref> as ''[[Little Switzerland (landscape)|Little Switzerland]]''. Nearby are the old mining and quarrying communities on the [[Clee Hills]], notable geological features in the [[River Onny|Onny Valley]] and [[Wenlock Edge]] and fertile farmland in the [[Corve Dale]].

[[Telford]] is the largest town in the county with a population of 138,241 (which is approximately 30% of the total Salopian populace); whereas the [[county town]] of [[Shrewsbury]] has a lower, but still sizeable population of 71,715 (15%). The other sizeable towns are [[Oswestry]], [[Bridgnorth]], [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]] and [[Ludlow]]. The historic town of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] now makes up part of the Telford conurbation. The majority of the other settlements can be classed as villages or small towns such as [[Much Wenlock]]. Several villages have larger populations than the smallest town, [[Clun]]. The largest of these, [[Bayston Hill]], is the 10th most inhabited settlement in the county.   The names of several villages close to the border are of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] origin, such as [[Gobowen]] and [[Selattyn]].\n\nThe larger settlements are primarily concentrated in a central belt that roughly follows the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]/[[M54 motorway|M54]] roadway.

There was a two-tier system of local government, constituting a [[county council]] (as the upper tier) and six [[non-metropolitan district|district]] councils \u2013 [[Bridgnorth (district)|Bridgnorth]], [[North Shropshire]], [[Oswestry (borough)|Oswestry]], [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]], [[South Shropshire]] and [[Telford and Wrekin|The Wrekin]]. In 1998 The Wrekin became a [[unitary authority]], administratively separate from the county council, and became Telford and Wrekin. The two-tier structure remained in the remainder of the county and was the least populated two-tier area in England.\n\nOswestry and Shrewsbury & Atcham were each granted borough status in 1974. Telford and Wrekin became a borough in 2002.\n\n===2009 restructuring===\n{{See also|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\n[[File:Shirehall and Lord Hill Column.JPG|left|thumb|Shropshire's [[Shirehall, Shrewsbury|Shirehall]] is located opposite [[Lord Hill's Column]].]]\nIn 2006 a local government white paper supported proposals for new [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] to be set up in England in certain areas. Existing [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] with small populations, such as [[Cornwall]], Northumberland and Shropshire, were favoured by the government to be covered by unitary authorities in one form or another (the county either becoming a single unitary authority, or be broken into a number of unitary authorities). For the counties in the 2009 reorganisation, existing unitary authority areas within the counties' [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial boundaries]] (such as Telford and Wrekin) were not to be affected and no boundary changes were planned.\n\nShropshire County Council, supported by South Shropshire District Council and Oswestry Borough Council, proposed to the government that the non-metropolitan county of Shropshire become a single unitary authority. This was opposed by the other 3 districts in the county, with Shrewsbury & Atcham Borough Council taking their objection to the High Court in a judicial review.\n\nThe proposal to create a Shropshire unitary authority, covering the area of the existing non-metropolitan county, was supported by the [[Department of Communities and Local Government|DCLG]] and 1 April 2009 was set as the date for the re-organisation to take place. The first elections to Shropshire Council took place on 4 June 2009, with the former Shropshire County Council being the continuing authority and its councillors became the first members of the new Shropshire Council on 1 April.\n\nPart of the proposals include [[civil parish|parishing]] and establishing a [[town council]] for Shrewsbury. The parish was created on 13 May 2008 and is the second most populous [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in England (only [[Weston-super-Mare]] has a greater population) with a population of over 70,000.\n\n===Political control of councils===\nShropshire Council has been under Conservative control since the first election held in 2009; [[Telford and Wrekin Council]] has been under [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] control since 2011.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Montgomery Canal at Maesbury Marsh.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Montgomery Canal]] at [[Maesbury Marsh]].]]\n{{See also|Railways of Shropshire}}\n[[File:82109 - Shrewsbury (8959190070).jpg|thumb|The direct [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] from [[Shrewsbury railway station|Shrewsbury]] to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] with a [[Driving Van Trailer|DVT]] and mailbags delivering the [[Royal Mail]] at a time when [[British Rail]] ran the network.]]\nShropshire is connected to the rest of the United Kingdom via a number of road and rail links.

In northern Shropshire three canals with a total navigable length of {{convert|41|mi|km}} are managed by the [[Canal & River Trust]]: the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] (from north of [[Adderley]] to near [[Knighton, Stafford, Staffordshire|Knighton]]), the [[Llangollen Canal]] (from [[Chirk Aqueduct]] to [[Grindley Brook]]) and the [[Montgomery Canal]] (from its beginning at [[Frankton Junction]] to [[Llanymynech]]).
