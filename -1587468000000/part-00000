The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point? Because situations may require him to do things and turn a blind eye to things that Jimmy McGill would not be able to stomach.<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\">{{Cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |title='Better Call Saul' creator on what lies ahead in season 5&nbsp;\u2013 and the return of Gene |date=December 12, 2018 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=December 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213021058/https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |archive-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nMain cast members [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] return from previous seasons as Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman, [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], [[Kim Wexler]],<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Howard Hamlin]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |title='Better Call Saul' star Patrick Fabian on the evolution of Howard, his soft spot for Rhea Seehorn and what to expect from season 5 |last=Pai |first=Akshay |date=November 13, 2018 |website=Meaww |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224034537/https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Nacho Varga]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |title=Michael Mando Is Living a Real Life Hollywood Fairy Tale |last=Scott |first=Savannah |date=December 11, 2018 |website=L'Officiel |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224033938/https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gus Fring]].<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Tony Dalton]], who recurred in season four as [[Lalo Salamanca]], was promoted to the main cast for the fifth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |title='Better Call Saul' Adds Tony Dalton As Series Regular For Season 5 |last=Ramos |first=Dino-Ray |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409061114/https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, it was announced that ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' actors [[Dean Norris]] and [[Steven Michael Quezada]] would reprise their roles as [[Hank Schrader]] and [[Steven Gomez]], along with actor [[Robert Forster]] who appeared posthumously as [[Ed Galbraith]].<ref name=\"BBCharacters\">{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |title='Better Call Saul' season 5 to feature the late Robert Forster, Dean Norris |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=January 16, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117041936/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |archive-date=January 17, 2020 |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> The first episode of the season was dedicated to Forster.<ref name=\"sepinwall\">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-1-magic-man-954059/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season Premiere Recap: \u2018Magic Man\u2019 |date=February 23, 2020 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 23, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fifth season began on April 10, 2019, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |title='Better Call Saul' begins filming season 5 in ABQ |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190414143824/https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/04/09/better-call-saul-season-5-amc-confirms-filming-this-week-patrick-fabian-briefly-talks-howard/ |title='Better Call Saul' Season 5: AMC Confirms Filming Begins This Week;

Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the settlement, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim\u2019s insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo was inspired by a photograph the bank never obtained permission to use. Jimmy pressures Kevin by threatening an injunction against displaying the logo and TV ads seeking plaintiffs for class action suits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably.

Gus and other subsidiary owners provide updates to Peter, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the meth lab's status.

Jimmy's car breaks down, so they push it over the edge of the road, then walk cross-country to avoid the gunman. They camp overnight, then continue their trek. When Jimmy fails to return, Kim asks Lalo for his location, but Lalo refuses. The gunman continues searching, so Jimmy acts as decoy and draws him in.

Kim accepts 20 pending felonies from the public defender ''pro bono''. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m. Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard warns Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. Mike tells Jimmy Lalo will be killed. Lalo introduces Nacho to Eladio. Eladio gives his blessing to Nacho's plans for the Salamanca drug business. Jimmy tells Kim Lalo will be killed.

In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel.

Kim says she does not want Jimmy to go, because he is a lawyer not a \u201cbagman\u201d for drug dealers, but he says it will be an easy job. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash to Jimmy, then depart. As Jimmy starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen. They take the money and prepare to kill him but are attacked by an unseen sniper. All but one are killed and the survivor escapes. The shooter is Mike, who drives off with Jimmy and the cash. Jimmy's car breaks down, so they push it over the edge of the road, then walk cross-country to avoid the gunman. They camp overnight, then continue their trek. When Jimmy fails to return, Kim asks Lalo for his location, but Lalo refuses. The gunman continues searching, so Jimmy acts as decoy and draws him in.

Initially termed \"[[progressive pop]]\", the style was an outgrowth of [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands who abandoned standard [[pop music|pop]] traditions in favour of [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] and [[Composition (music)|composition]]al techniques more frequently associated with [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], or [[classical music]]. Additional elements contributed to its \"[[progressive music|progressive]]\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"[[art music|art]]\", and the studio, rather than the stage, [[Recording studio as an instrument|became the focus of musical activity]], which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.\n\nProg is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between [[formalism (music)|formalism]] and [[eclecticism in music|eclecticism]]. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, long albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of [[high culture]] and [[low culture]], few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.\n\nThe genre coincided with the mid-1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists, as well as the new journalistic division between \"pop\" and \"rock\" that lent generic significance to both terms. Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid-1970s, but faded soon after. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of [[punk rock]] caused this, but several more factors contributed to the decline.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=1}} Music critics, who often labelled the concepts as \"pretentious\" and the sounds as \"pompous\" and \"overblown\", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it.{{sfn|Lucky|2000|p=7}} After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into [[symphonic pop]], [[arena rock]], or [[new wave music|new wave]].\n\nEarly groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as \"[[proto-prog]]\". The [[Canterbury scene]], originating in the late 1960s, denotes a subset of prog bands who emphasised the use of [[wind instrument]]s, complex chord changes and long improvisations. [[Rock in Opposition]], from the late 1970s, was more [[avant-garde]], and when combined with the [[Canterbury]] style, created [[avant-prog]]. In the 1980s, a new subgenre, [[neo-progressive rock]], enjoyed some commercial success, although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation. [[Post-progressive]] draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid 1970s.\n\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n==Definition and characteristics==\n{{Details|Progressive music}}\n\n===Scope and related terms===\n{{See also|Progressive pop|Art rock}} and when the pp is so hard, you must make it gogo in girl pp\nThe term \"progressive rock\" is synonymous with \"[[art rock]]\", \"classical rock\" and \"symphonic rock\".{{sfn|Covach|1997|p=5}} Historically, \"art rock\" has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}} The first is progressive rock as it is generally understood, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected [[psychedelia]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] in favour of a [[modernist]], [[avant-garde]] approach.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|In the rock music of the 1970s, the \"art\" descriptor was generally understood to mean \"aggressively avant-garde\" or \"pretentiously progressive\".<ref name=\"ArtPunkMurray\">{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=60 minutes of music that sum up art-punk pioneers Wire|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/60-minutes-music-sum-art-punk-pioneers-wire-219113|website=[[The A.V.

Debate over the genre's criterion continued to the 2010s, particularly on Internet forums dedicated to prog.{{sfn|Robinson|2017|p=223}}\n\nAccording to musicologists [[Paul Hegarty]] and Martin Halliwell, [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] and Edward Macan authored major books about prog rock while \"effectively accept[ing] the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics.  ... they each do so largely unconsciously.\"{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=2}} Academic John S. Cotner contests Macan's view that progressive rock cannot exist without the continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock.{{sfn|Cotner|2000|p=90}} Author Kevin Holm-Hudson agrees that \"progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics.\"{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|p=16}}\n\n===Relation to art and social theories===\n{{See also|Formalism (music)|Eclecticism in music}}\nIn early references to the music, \"progressive\" was partly related to [[progressive politics]], but those connotations were lost during the 1970s.{{sfn|Robinson|2017|p=223}} On \"progressive music\", Holm-Hudson writes that it \"moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]]\".{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|pp=85\u201387}}{{refn|group=nb|Formalism refers to a preoccupation with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and the autonomy of individual art works. Eclecticism, like formalism, connotates a predilection towards style synthesis, or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms and cultural codes.

Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics, and shunning of rock's blues roots, were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=168-73}} Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=107}} Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{refn|group=nb|Yes' ''Tales from Topographic Oceans''{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=145}} and \"[[The Gates of Delirium]]\"{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=158}} were both responses to such criticisms. Jethro Tull's ''[[Thick As a Brick]]'', a self-satirising [[concept album]] that consisted of a single 45-minute track, arose from the band's disagreement with the labelling of their previous ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' as a concept album.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|}}}}\n\nThe genre's greatest appeal is to white males.{{sfn|Bowman|2001|p=184}} Most of the musicians involved were male, as was the case for most rock of the time,{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=204}} Female singers were better represented in [[progressive folk]] bands,{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=135}} who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=204}} with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=131}}\n\nBritish and European audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found American audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=263}}\n\nThese aspirations towards [[high culture]] reflect progressive rock's origins as a music created largely by [[Upper class|upper]]- and [[Middle class|middle]]-class, [[White-collar workers|white-collar]], college-educated males from [[Southern England]]. The music never reflected the concerns of or was embraced by working-class listeners,{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=144\u201348}} except in the US, where listeners appreciated the musicians' virtuosity.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=156}} Progressive rock's exotic, literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to British youth during the late 1970s, when the nation suffered from a poor economy and frequent strikes and shortages.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=163\u2013164}} Even King Crimson leader Robert Fripp dismissed progressive rock lyrics as \"the philosophical meanderings of some English half-wit who is circumnavigating some inessential point of experience in his life\".{{sfn|Tamm|1990|}} Bands whose darker lyrics avoided utopianism, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Van der Graaf Generator, experienced less critical disfavour.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=78}}\n\n\"I wasn't a big fan of most of what you'd call progressive rock\", remarked Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]]. \"I'm like [[Groucho Marx]]: I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Echoes' to be Floyd's final cut?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|issue=36|date=January 2002|p=15}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I still like the original term that comes from 1969: progressive rock \u2013 but that was with a small 'p' and a small 'r'. Prog Rock, on the other hand, has different connotations \u2013 of grandeur and pomposity,\" commented Jethro Tull frontman [[Ian Anderson]] on the nuance of the genre. \"Back then, when we were doing ''Thick as a Brick'', bands like Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer were already gaining a reputation for being a little pompous and showing off with their music. I think that was OK. The reality is that certain members of Yes were quite humorous about it; they could laugh at themselves \u2013 as, indeed, Emerson Lake and Palmer privately laughed amongst themselves about themselves.\" He added, \"But that's part of what was going on back then, and I think looking back on it that most of it was a pretty good experience for musicians and listeners alike. Some of it was a little bit overblown, but in the case of much of the music, it was absolutely spot on.<ref>http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ian-anderson-prog-overblown/</ref>}}\n\n==List of progressive rock bands==\n{{main|List of progressive rock artists}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n* [[Characteristics of progressive rock]]\n* [[British folk rock]]\n* [[Free jazz]]\n* [[List of musical works in unusual time signatures]] \n* [[Minimal music]]\n* [[Musique concr\u00e8te]]\n* [[Second Viennese School]]\n* [[Serialism]]\n* [[Third stream]]\n* [[Timeline of progressive rock]]\n* [[:Category:Progressive rock record labels]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Citation|last=Anderson|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Anderson|year=2008|title=BBC Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements|publisher=BBC Four|type=Televised interview}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brown|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Brown (musician)|year=2008|title=BBC Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements|publisher=BBC Four|type=Televised interview}}\n* {{Citation|last=Cleveland|first=Barry|date=March 2005|title=Prog Rock|magazine=Guitar Player|publisher=NewBay Media LLC}}\n* {{Citation|last=Clark|first=William|date=25 August 2012|title=Ian Crichton Talks About Saga, Guitars, Throwing Shapes and 20/20|publisher=guitarinternational.com|url=http://guitarinternational.com/2012/08/25/ian-crichton-talks-about-saga-guitars-and-throwing-shapes/|accessdate=6 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426180455/http://guitarinternational.com/2012/08/25/ian-crichton-talks-about-saga-guitars-and-throwing-shapes/|archivedate=26 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{Citation|last=Fripp|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fripp|year=1975|title=The Young Person's Guide to King Crimson|publisher=EG Records, Ltd|type=LP liner notes}}\n* {{Citation|last=Gill|first=Chris|date=April 1995|title=Prog gnosis: a new generation exhumes the list wisdom of the '70s|magazine=Guitar Player}}\n* {{Citation|last=Harrell|first=Jim|year=2012|title=Calprog.com|publisher=Calprog.com|url=http://www.calprog.com/|accessdate=28 May 2013}}\n* {{Citation|last=Hogg|first=Brian|date=November 1994|title=1-2-3 and the Birth of Prog|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|publisher=BBC/Guinness Publishing}}\n* {{Citation|last=O'Brien|first=Lucy|year=1999|title=Sounds of the Psychedelic Sixties|publisher=britannica.com|url=http://kids.britannica.com/psychedelic/textonly/psychedelic.html|accessdate=18 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817101251/http://kids.britannica.com/psychedelic/textonly/psychedelic.html|archivedate=17 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Bannister|title=White Boys, White Noise: Masculinities and 1980s Indie Guitar Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ckLKGTXRwQC&pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-8803-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation|last=Boone|first=edited by John Covach & Graeme M.|title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-510005-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}\n* {{Citation|last=Boone|first=edited by John Covach & Graeme M.|title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-510005-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}\n* {{Citation|last=Bowman|first=Durrell S.|editor=K.

Initially termed \"[[progressive pop]]\", the style was an outgrowth of [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands who abandoned standard [[pop music|pop]] traditions in favour of [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] and [[Composition (music)|composition]]al techniques more frequently associated with [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], or [[classical music]]. Additional elements contributed to its \"[[progressive music|progressive]]\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"[[art music|art]]\", and the studio, rather than the stage, [[Recording studio as an instrument|became the focus of musical activity]], which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.\n\nProg is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between [[formalism (music)|formalism]] and [[eclecticism in music|eclecticism]]. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, long albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of [[high culture]] and [[low culture]], few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.\n\nThe genre coincided with the mid-1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists, as well as the new journalistic division between \"pop\" and \"rock\" that lent generic significance to both terms. Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid-1970s, but faded soon after. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of [[punk rock]] caused this, but several more factors contributed to the decline.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=1}} Music critics, who often labelled the concepts as \"pretentious\" and the sounds as \"pompous\" and \"overblown\", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it.{{sfn|Lucky|2000|p=7}} After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into [[symphonic pop]], [[arena rock]], or [[new wave music|new wave]].\n\nEarly groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as \"[[proto-prog]]\". The [[Canterbury scene]], originating in the late 1960s, denotes a subset of prog bands who emphasised the use of [[wind instrument]]s, complex chord changes and long improvisations.

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Evan Serpick: \"Along with recent success stories like [[System of a Down]] and up-and-comers like the [[Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], and [[Coheed and Cambria]], [[the Mars Volta]] create incredibly complex and inventive music that sounds like a heavier, more aggressive version of '70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Serpick|first=Evan|date=9 May 2005|title=Prog Rocks Again|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1058164,00.html}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nThe Progressive Music Awards were launched in 2012 by the British magazine ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' to honour the genre's established acts and to promote its newer bands. Honorees, however, are not invited to perform at the awards ceremony, as the promoters want an event \"that doesn't last three weeks\".{{sfn|Sherwin|2012|}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Festivals==\nMany prominent progressive rock bands got their initial exposure at large [[rock festival]]s that were held in Britain during the late 1960s and early 1970s. King Crimson made their first major appearance at the [[Stones in the Park|1969 Hyde Park free concert]], before a crowd estimated to be as large as 650,000, in support of [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Fripp|1975|}} Emerson, Lake & Palmer debuted at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]], at which Supertramp, [[Family (band)|Family]] and Jethro Tull also appeared.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=50\u201351}} Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 [[Newport Jazz Festival]], the first year in which that festival invited rock bands to perform. [[Hawkwind]] appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage on the periphery of the event, and played for free.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=50}}\n\n[[file:King Crimson - Dour Festival 2003 (01).jpg|thumb|right|[[King Crimson]] performing at the Dour Festival, 2003.]]\nRenewed interest in the genre in the 1990s led to the development of progressive rock festivals.{{sfn|Gill|1995|}} ProgFest, organised by Greg Walker and David Overstreet in 1993, was first held in [[UCLA]]'s Royce Hall,{{sfn|Covach|2000|}} and featured Sweden's \u00c4nglag\u00e5rd, the UK's IQ, Quill and Citadel. CalProg was held annually in Whittier, California during the 2000s.{{sfn|Harrell|2012|}} The North East Art Rock Festival, or [[NEARfest]],{{sfn|Karnick|2003|}} held its first event in 1999 in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] and held annual sold-out concerts until 2012's NEARfest Apocalypse, which featured headliners [[U.K. (band)|UK]] and Renaissance.{{sfn|Weigel|2012e|}} Other festivals include the annual ProgDay (the longest-running and only outdoor prog festival) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], the annual [[Rites of Spring Festival]] (RoSfest){{sfn|Rosfest staff|2013|}} in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], [[The Rogue Independent Music Festival]] in Atlanta, Georgia, [[Baja Prog]] in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]], [[ProgPower USA]] in Atlanta, Georgia, [[ProgPower Europe]] in [[Baarlo]], Netherlands, and ProgStock in Rahway, NJ, which held its first event in 2017.<ref>http://www.progstock.com</ref> Progressive Nation tours were held in 2008 and [[Progressive Nation 2009|2009]] with Dream Theater as the headline act. \"Night of the Prog\" in St Goarshausen (Germany) is an established European progressive rock festival held every July during 2\u20133 days for 12 years.\n\n==Reception==\nThe genre has received both critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]].{{sfn|Covach|2000|}} This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop, dismayed critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics, and shunning of rock's blues roots, were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=168-73}} Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=107}} Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{refn|group=nb|Yes' ''Tales from Topographic Oceans''{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=145}} and \"[[The Gates of Delirium]]\"{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=158}} were both responses to such criticisms. Jethro Tull's ''[[Thick As a Brick]]'', a self-satirising [[concept album]] that consisted of a single 45-minute track, arose from the band's disagreement with the labelling of their previous ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' as a concept album.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|}}}}\n\nThe genre's greatest appeal is to white males.{{sfn|Bowman|2001|p=184}} Most of the musicians involved were male, as was the case for most rock of the time,{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=204}} Female singers were better represented in [[progressive folk]] bands,{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=135}} who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=204}} with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=131}}\n\nBritish and European audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found American audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=263}}\n\nThese aspirations towards [[high culture]] reflect progressive rock's origins as a music created largely by [[Upper class|upper]]- and [[Middle class|middle]]-class, [[White-collar workers|white-collar]], college-educated males from [[Southern England]]. The music never reflected the concerns of or was embraced by working-class listeners,{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=144\u201348}} except in the US, where listeners appreciated the musicians' virtuosity.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=156}} Progressive rock's exotic, literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to British youth during the late 1970s, when the nation suffered from a poor economy and frequent strikes and shortages.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=163\u2013164}} Even King Crimson leader Robert Fripp dismissed progressive rock lyrics as \"the philosophical meanderings of some English half-wit who is circumnavigating some inessential point of experience in his life\".{{sfn|Tamm|1990|}} Bands whose darker lyrics avoided utopianism, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Van der Graaf Generator, experienced less critical disfavour.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=78}}\n\n\"I wasn't a big fan of most of what you'd call progressive rock\", remarked Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]]. \"I'm like [[Groucho Marx]]: I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Echoes' to be Floyd's final cut?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|issue=36|date=January 2002|p=15}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I still like the original term that comes from 1969: progressive rock \u2013 but that was with a small 'p' and a small 'r'. Prog Rock, on the other hand, has different connotations \u2013 of grandeur and pomposity,\" commented Jethro Tull frontman [[Ian Anderson]] on the nuance of the genre. \"Back then, when we were doing ''Thick as a Brick'', bands like Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer were already gaining a reputation for being a little pompous and showing off with their music. I think that was OK. The reality is that certain members of Yes were quite humorous about it; they could laugh at themselves \u2013 as, indeed, Emerson Lake and Palmer privately laughed amongst themselves about themselves.\" He added, \"But that's part of what was going on back then, and I think looking back on it that most of it was a pretty good experience for musicians and listeners alike. Some of it was a little bit overblown, but in the case of much of the music, it was absolutely spot on.<ref>http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ian-anderson-prog-overblown/</ref>}}\n\n==List of progressive rock bands==\n{{main|List of progressive rock artists}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n* [[Characteristics of progressive rock]]\n* [[British folk rock]]\n* [[Free jazz]]\n* [[List of musical works in unusual time signatures]] \n* [[Minimal music]]\n* [[Musique concr\u00e8te]]\n* [[Second Viennese School]]\n* [[Serialism]]\n* [[Third stream]]\n* [[Timeline of progressive rock]]\n* [[:Category:Progressive rock record labels]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Citation|last=Anderson|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Anderson|year=2008|title=BBC Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements|publisher=BBC Four|type=Televised interview}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brown|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Brown (musician)|year=2008|title=BBC Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements|publisher=BBC Four|type=Televised interview}}\n* {{Citation|last=Cleveland|first=Barry|date=March 2005|title=Prog Rock|magazine=Guitar Player|publisher=NewBay Media LLC}}\n* {{Citation|last=Clark|first=William|date=25 August 2012|title=Ian Crichton Talks About Saga, Guitars, Throwing Shapes and 20/20|publisher=guitarinternational.com|url=http://guitarinternational.com/2012/08/25/ian-crichton-talks-about-saga-guitars-and-throwing-shapes/|accessdate=6 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426180455/http://guitarinternational.com/2012/08/25/ian-crichton-talks-about-saga-guitars-and-throwing-shapes/|archivedate=26 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{Citation|last=Fripp|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fripp|year=1975|title=The Young Person's Guide to King Crimson|publisher=EG Records, Ltd|type=LP liner notes}}\n* {{Citation|last=Gill|first=Chris|date=April 1995|title=Prog gnosis: a new generation exhumes the list wisdom of the '70s|magazine=Guitar Player}}\n* {{Citation|last=Harrell|first=Jim|year=2012|title=Calprog.com|publisher=Calprog.com|url=http://www.calprog.com/|accessdate=28 May 2013}}\n* {{Citation|last=Hogg|first=Brian|date=November 1994|title=1-2-3 and the Birth of Prog|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|publisher=BBC/Guinness Publishing}}\n* {{Citation|last=O'Brien|first=Lucy|year=1999|title=Sounds of the Psychedelic Sixties|publisher=britannica.com|url=http://kids.britannica.com/psychedelic/textonly/psychedelic.html|accessdate=18 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817101251/http://kids.britannica.com/psychedelic/textonly/psychedelic.html|archivedate=17 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Bannister|title=White Boys, White Noise: Masculinities and 1980s Indie Guitar Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ckLKGTXRwQC&pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-8803-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation|last=Boone|first=edited by John Covach & Graeme M.|title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-510005-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}\n* {{Citation|last=Boone|first=edited by John Covach & Graeme M.|title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-510005-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}\n* {{Citation|last=Bowman|first=Durrell S.|editor=K.

{"title_page": "Round robin algorithm", "text_new": "\n\n==WHAT IS ROUND ROBIN?==\nThe Round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is designed especially for timesharing systems.\n\nIt is similar to FCFS scheduling except that is a purely preemptive algorithm.\n\nA small unit of time, called a time quantum or time slice, is defined. A time quantum is generally from 10 to 100 milliseconds\n\nThe ready queue is treated as a circular queue. The ready queue is treated like a FIFO queue of processes. New processes are added to the tail of the ready queue. The CPU picks the first process from the ready queue, sets a timer to interrupt after 1-time quantum, and dispatches the process.\n\n<ref>https://learnprogramo.com/round-robin-program-in/</ref>\n\n==ROUND ROBIN ALGORITHM:==\nThe CPU scheduler travels the ready queue, allocates the CPU to each process for a time interval of up to 1-time quantum, the process is preempted and the next process in the queue is allocated the CPU.\n\nIf the process has a CPU burst of less than 1-time quantum then the process releases the CPU and the scheduler selects the next process in the ready queue.\n\nIf the CPU burst of the currently running process is longer than 1-time quantum, the timer will go off and will cause an interrupt to the operating system. A context switch will be executed, and the process will be put at the tail of the ready queue. The CPU scheduler will then select the next process in the ready queue.\n\n==Advantages==\nAlgorithm logic is simple.\n\nSystem supports multiprogramming effectively.\n\nGives a better response than SJF.\n\n==disadvantages==\nThe average waiting time under RR is often long.\n\nIf the duration of time quantum is very large, the system acts as FIFO.\n\nAverage turnaround time is higher than SJF.\n\nIf the duration of time quantum is very small, then Every time a dispatcher is called. More context switching and a large amount of time is wasted in transferring PCB contents to internal registers to PCB.\n", "text_old": "#REDIRECT [[Round-robin]]\n\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n", "name_user": "Learnprogramo", "label": "safe", "comment": "i have written the detail article on round robin which make user understandable clearly", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_robin_algorithm"}

{"title_page": "Mountain caribou conservation", "text_new": "'''[[Boreal woodland caribou]]''' ''(Rangifer tarandus caribou)'' are a species of [[caribou]] and subspecies of North American [[reindeer]]. Boreal woodland caribou are also known as southern mountain caribou, woodland caribou, and forest-dwelling caribou. Mountain caribou are uniquely adapted to live in [[old-growth forest]]s. The mountain caribou diet consists of tree-dwelling [[lichen]]s predominantly. They are unique in this aspect as in the far northern regions of their habitat zones, the snowpack is shallow enough that the boreal woodland caribou can paw through the snow to eat the ground-dwelling lichens. In the inland [[Pacific Northwest]] Rainforests of eastern [[British Columbia]], where the [[snowpack]] can reach upwards of five meters, the mountain caribou rely predominantly on the tree-dwelling lichens such as [[Wila (lichen)]] (Bryoria spp.) and witch\u2019s hair ([[Alectoria (fungus)]] (Alectoria spp.), hanging above the snowpack.<ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. As a result, these mountain caribou are reliant upon the old growth forests, which have been logged for centuries and continue to dwindle <ref>Cox, Sarah. \u201cU.S. Lists B.C.

Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The areas set aside by further Canadian National Parks \u2013 [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], the [[Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park and Protected Area]], [[Valhalla Provincial Park]] \u2013 are not as conducive for the specially adapted caribou as these areas are mostly ice, rock, alpine meadows and sub-alpine parkland and are lacking in the old-growth forests which provide the tree-dwelling lichens pivotal to the mountain caribou diet<ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>.\n\nBy the 1980s in [[Canada]], the northern areas of the mountain caribou habitat zones had the most remaining mountain caribou as a result of northern forest districts land management programs beginning to set aside old-growth forests specifically for these caribou <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. In 1983 in the [[United States]], the South Selkirk mountain caribou subpopulation were designated endangered by the Endangered Species Act. Despite these protections afforded to it under the legislation, the mountain caribou declined quickly in number<ref>\u201cLawsuit Launched to Protect Dwindling Mountain Caribou.\u201d Center for Biological Diversity, https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/mountain-caribou-02-13-2019.php. </ref>. As the South Selkirk herd languished despite these protections, the US Fish and Wildlife Service augmented the herd from its Canadian brethren in the 1990s, raising population levels to 100. However, the effort was abandoned, and the South Selkirk herd declined again <ref>\u201cLawsuit Launched to Protect Dwindling Mountain Caribou.\u201d Center for Biological Diversity, https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/mountain-caribou-02-13-2019.php. </ref>. \n\nIn 1994, the [[Commission on Resources and Environment]] (CORE), was implemented with the focus on regional planning and implementation of land use while addressing conservation issues <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The land use designations were brought together by a synthesis of groups with significant interests in these inland temperate rainforests. The negotiations between public, industrial, and governmental stakeholders forced trade-offs between these various interest groups. There were many interests, with protection of endangered species and forest conservation only constituting two of many. Predominant theory at the time constituted that logging could take place and simultaneously preserve enough of the caribou\u2019s old growth habitat <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref> which led to the creation of the Cariboo Mountains Provincial Park <ref>Environment, Ministry of. \u201cHistory of Cariboo Mountain Provincial Park.\u201d BC Parks Public Consultations, Province of British Columbia, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/cariboo_mt/nat_cul.html#History. </ref> amongst others. Despite the focus on protections and conservation of the mountain caribou, herd numbers since the CORE was established have continued to diminish from approximately 2,450 spread across 17 separate isolated subpopulations to 1,900 animals in 15 subpopulations between 1997 and 2002 (Mountain Caribou Technical Advisory Committee, 2002) as a result of the continued logging of old growth in the Kuskanax, Duncan, Lardeau, and Adams River watersheds.\n\nIn 2011, following litigation and petitions from multiple environmental conservation organizations, which included the Center for Biological Diversity, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended 375,000 acres for critical habitat protection of the mountain caribou. After opposition from outdoor recreational outfits, mostly snowmobilers who ride on the public lands which would have been set aside for mountain caribou, the US Fish and Wildlife Service scaled back the proposed protected area to 30,000 acres <ref>Robbins, Jim. \u201cAmerica's Gray Ghosts: The Disappearing Caribou.\u201d The New York Times, 3 Oct. 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/endangered-caribou-idaho-british-columbia.html?_r=2.</ref>.\n\nIn 2019, two local mountain caribou subpopulations, the South Selkirk and South Purcell subspecies, were designated as extinct <ref>Cox, Sarah. \u201c'A Sad Day': Two More B.C. Mountain Caribou Herds Now Locally Extinct.\u201d The Narwhal, The Narwhal, 23 Jan. 2019, https://thenarwhal.ca/a-sad-day-two-more-b-c-mountain-caribou-herds-now-locally-extinct/.</ref>. In January 2019, the last three survivors of these subpopulations were rounded up by the British Columbian government and sent to a pen near [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]], British Columbia, where the two females and male would join another orphaned mountain caribou named Grace at the pen. The hope and focus would be to allow for continued breeding and eventual release into the wild.\n\n==Environmental threats==\nErratic weather patterns, an effect of [[climate change]], are having an adverse effect on the mountain caribou <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The trend towards more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns and climactic conditions are forcing caribou periodically to leave their safe winter stronghold of the mountains for more marginal lower elevation habitats. The reason being is the constant changes in snowpack \u2013 significant snowfall one year to minimal snow the next. The lack of consistency is forcing the caribou to adapt and change their eating patterns to newer growth forests, which lack the lichens that the older growth forests provide for sustenance <ref>Kinley, Trevor A., et al. \u201cThe Influence of Variable Snowpacks on Habitat Use by Mountain Caribou.\u201d Rangifer, vol. 27, no. 4, Jan. 2007, p. 93., doi:10.7557/2.27.4.323. </ref>. Abundant lichens are restricted to forests older than about 100 years <ref>Goward, T. 1998. Observations on the ecology of the lichen genus Bryoria in high elevation conifer forests. The  Canadian Field-Naturalist: 112:496-501</ref>. Moving to these lower elevation habitats force the caribou to move to areas that have been logged historically and allow for increased chances of being killed by [wolves]. Wolves have surged in population in southern British Columbia since 2009 as a result in larger populations of deer and moose that have developed.

Boreal woodland caribou are also known as southern mountain caribou, woodland caribou, and forest-dwelling caribou. Mountain caribou are uniquely adapted to live in [[old-growth forest]]s. The mountain caribou diet consists of tree-dwelling [[lichen]]s predominantly. They are unique in this aspect as in the far northern regions of their habitat zones, the snowpack is shallow enough that the boreal woodland caribou can paw through the snow to eat the ground-dwelling lichens. In the inland [[Pacific Northwest]] Rainforests of eastern [[British Columbia]], where the [[snowpack]] can reach upwards of five meters, the mountain caribou rely predominantly on the tree-dwelling lichens such as [[Wila (lichen)]] (Bryoria spp.) and witch\u2019s hair ([[Alectoria (fungus)]] (Alectoria spp.), hanging above the snowpack.<ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. As a result, these mountain caribou are reliant upon the old growth forests, which have been logged for centuries and continue to dwindle <ref>Cox, Sarah. \u201cU.S. Lists B.C.

Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The areas set aside by further Canadian National Parks \u2013 [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], the [[Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park and Protected Area]], [[Valhalla Provincial Park]] \u2013 are not as conducive for the specially adapted caribou as these areas are mostly ice, rock, alpine meadows and sub-alpine parkland and are lacking in the old-growth forests which provide the tree-dwelling lichens pivotal to the mountain caribou diet<ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>.\n\nBy the 1980s in [[Canada]], the northern areas of the mountain caribou habitat zones had the most remaining mountain caribou as a result of northern forest districts land management programs beginning to set aside old-growth forests specifically for these caribou <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. In 1983 in the [[United States]], the South Selkirk mountain caribou subpopulation were designated endangered by the Endangered Species Act. Despite these protections afforded to it under the legislation, the mountain caribou declined quickly in number<ref>\u201cLawsuit Launched to Protect Dwindling Mountain Caribou.\u201d Center for Biological Diversity, https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/mountain-caribou-02-13-2019.php. </ref>. As the South Selkirk herd languished despite these protections, the US Fish and Wildlife Service augmented the herd from its Canadian brethren in the 1990s, raising population levels to 100. However, the effort was abandoned, and the South Selkirk herd declined again <ref>\u201cLawsuit Launched to Protect Dwindling Mountain Caribou.\u201d Center for Biological Diversity, https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/mountain-caribou-02-13-2019.php. </ref>. \n\nIn 1994, the [[Commission on Resources and Environment]] (CORE), was implemented with the focus on regional planning and implementation of land use while addressing conservation issues <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The land use designations were brought together by a synthesis of groups with significant interests in these inland temperate rainforests. The negotiations between public, industrial, and governmental stakeholders forced trade-offs between these various interest groups. There were many interests, with protection of endangered species and forest conservation only constituting two of many. Predominant theory at the time constituted that logging could take place and simultaneously preserve enough of the caribou\u2019s old growth habitat <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref> which led to the creation of the Cariboo Mountains Provincial Park <ref>Environment, Ministry of. \u201cHistory of Cariboo Mountain Provincial Park.\u201d BC Parks Public Consultations, Province of British Columbia, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/cariboo_mt/nat_cul.html#History. </ref> amongst others. Despite the focus on protections and conservation of the mountain caribou, herd numbers since the CORE was established have continued to diminish from approximately 2,450 spread across 17 separate isolated subpopulations to 1,900 animals in 15 subpopulations between 1997 and 2002 (Mountain Caribou Technical Advisory Committee, 2002) as a result of the continued logging of old growth in the Kuskanax, Duncan, Lardeau, and Adams River watersheds.\n\nIn 2011, following litigation and petitions from multiple environmental conservation organizations, which included the Center for Biological Diversity, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] recommended 375,000 acres for critical habitat protection of the mountain caribou. After opposition from outdoor recreational outfits, mostly snowmobilers who ride on the public lands which would have been set aside for mountain caribou, the US Fish and Wildlife Service scaled back the proposed protected area to 30,000 acres <ref>Robbins, Jim. \u201cAmerica's Gray Ghosts: The Disappearing Caribou.\u201d The New York Times, 3 Oct. 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/endangered-caribou-idaho-british-columbia.html?_r=2.</ref>.\n\nIn 2019, two local mountain caribou subpopulations, the South Selkirk and South Purcell subspecies, were designated as extinct <ref>Cox, Sarah. \u201c'A Sad Day': Two More B.C. Mountain Caribou Herds Now Locally Extinct.\u201d The Narwhal, The Narwhal, 23 Jan. 2019, https://thenarwhal.ca/a-sad-day-two-more-b-c-mountain-caribou-herds-now-locally-extinct/.</ref>. In January 2019, the last three survivors of these subpopulations were rounded up by the British Columbian government and sent to a pen near [[Revelstoke]], British Columbia, where the two females and male would join another orphaned mountain caribou named Grace at the pen. The hope and focus would be to allow for continued breeding and eventual release into the wild.\n\n==Environmental threats==\nErratic weather patterns, an effect of [[climate change]], are having an adverse effect on the mountain caribou <ref>DellaSala, Dominick A. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press, 2011. </ref>. The trend towards more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns and climactic conditions are forcing caribou periodically to leave their safe winter stronghold of the mountains for more marginal lower elevation habitats. The reason being is the constant changes in snowpack \u2013 significant snowfall one year to minimal snow the next. The lack of consistency is forcing the caribou to adapt and change their eating patterns to newer growth forests, which lack the lichens that the older growth forests provide for sustenance <ref>Kinley, Trevor A., et al. \u201cThe Influence of Variable Snowpacks on Habitat Use by Mountain Caribou.\u201d Rangifer, vol. 27, no. 4, Jan. 2007, p. 93., doi:10.7557/2.27.4.323. </ref>.

Although himself a Roman Catholic, he introduced freedom of worship, supported public education, and sought to reduce the power of the clergy in local political affairs. As senator, following the annexation of the [[United Provinces of Central Italy]], Azeglio attempted to [[Roman Question|reconcile the Vatican with the new Italian Kingdom]]. His brother [[Luigi Taparelli|Luigi Taparelli d'Azeglio]] was a Jesuit priest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letteraturaitaliana.net/pdf/Volume_8/t207.pdf|title=I miei ricordi}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMassimo Taparelli, Marquis d'Azeglio, was born in [[Turin]] on 24 October 1798. He was descended from an ancient and noble [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]ese family. His father, Cesare d'Azeglio, an officer in the Piedmontese army, held a high position at court. On the return of [[Pope Pius VII]] to Rome after the fall of Napoleon, Cesare was sent as special envoy to the [[Holy See]] and took his son, then sixteen years of age, with him as an extra attach\u00e9. Young Massimo was given a commission in a [[cavalry]] regiment, which he soon relinquished on account of his health. During his residence in Rome, Massimo acquired a love for art and music and decided to become a painter, to the horror of his conservative, aristocratic family. His father reluctantly consented, and Massimo settled in Rome, devoting himself to art.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:D'AZEGLIO-Vita di lago con barca.jpg|thumb|left|M. d'Azeglio:''Life on the lake with a boat''.]]\nHe led an abstemious life in Rome, maintaining himself by painting [[Romanticism|Romantic]] landscapes which frequently included historical subjects. He also painted scenes for a self-composed opera.<ref>*{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Bryan|year=1889|title=''Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Biographical and Critical'' (Volume II L-Z)|editor=Walter Armstrong & Robert Edmund Graves|pages=551|publisher=George Bell and Sons|location=York St. No. 4, Covent Garden, London; Original from Fogg Library, Digitized 18 May 2007|id=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2cCAAAAYAAJ|authorlink=}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V-lMAQAAMAAJ ''Modern Italian Painters''], article by JM, The Westminster Review, 1841, Volume 35, page 387.</ref> In 1830 he returned to Turin and, after his father's death in 1831, moved to [[Milan]]. He resided in Milan for twelve years, moving in the city's literary and artistic circles and, in 1834, helped to organise the ''Salotto Maffei'' [[salon (gathering)|salon]], hosted by [[Clara Maffei]]. He became an intimate of [[Alessandro Manzoni]] the novelist, whose daughter he married. At that point, literature instead of art became his chief occupation; he produced two historical novels, ''Niccol\u00f2 dei Lapi'' and ''[[Ettore Fieramosca (novel)|Ettore Fieramosca]]'', in imitation of [[Walter Scott]]. The novels had a strong political context, with d'Azeglio aiming to illustrate the evils of foreign domination in Italy and to reawaken national feeling.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1845 d'Azeglio visited [[Romagna]] as an unauthorized political envoy, to report on its conditions and the troubles which he foresaw would break out on the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. The following year he published his famous pamphlet ''Degli ultimi casi di Romagna'' at [[Florence]]; as a consequence of this he was expelled from [[Tuscany]]. He spent the next few months in Rome, sharing the general enthusiasm over the supposed liberalism of the new pope, [[pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]; like [[Vincenzo Gioberti]] he believed in an Italian confederation under papal auspices and was opposed to the Radical wing of the Liberal party. His political activity increased and he wrote various other pamphlets, among which was ''I lutti di Lombardia'' (1848).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn the outbreak of the first war of independence, d'Azeglio donned the papal uniform and took part under General Durando in the defence of [[Vicenza]], where he was severely wounded. He retired to Florence to recover, but as he opposed the ruling democrats he was expelled from Tuscany a second time. He was now a famous man, and early in 1849 [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert, king of Sardinia]], invited him to form a cabinet. Realizing how impossible it was to renew the campaign, but \"not having the heart to sign, in such wretched internal and external conditions, a treaty of peace with Austria\" (''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'', by E Rendu), he refused.<!-- This last sentence is not clear -->{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Prime Minister of Sardinia==\n[[File:Francesco Hayez - Ritratto di Massimo d\u2019Azeglio.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Massimo D'Azeglio portraited by [[Francesco Hayez]] (1860).]]\nAfter the defeat at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] (23 March 1849), Charles Albert abdicated and was succeeded by [[Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel II]]. D'Azeglio was again called on to form a cabinet; this time, although the situation was even more difficult, he accepted, concluded a peace treaty, dissolved the Chamber and summoned a new one to ratify it. The treaty was accepted and d'Azeglio continued in office for the next three years. While all the rest of Italy was a prey to despotism, in Piedmont the king maintained the constitution intact in the face of a general wave of reaction.

He was descended from an ancient and noble [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]ese family. His father, Cesare d'Azeglio, an officer in the Piedmontese army, held a high position at court. On the return of [[Pope Pius VII]] to Rome after the fall of Napoleon, Cesare was sent as special envoy to the [[Holy See]] and took his son, then sixteen years of age, with him as an extra attach\u00e9. Young Massimo was given a commission in a [[cavalry]] regiment, which he soon relinquished on account of his health. During his residence in Rome, Massimo acquired a love for art and music and decided to become a painter, to the horror of his conservative, aristocratic family. His father reluctantly consented, and Massimo settled in Rome, devoting himself to art.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:D'AZEGLIO-Vita di lago con barca.jpg|thumb|left|M. d'Azeglio:''Life on the lake with a boat''.]]\nHe led an abstemious life in Rome, maintaining himself by painting [[Romanticism|Romantic]] landscapes which frequently included historical subjects.

He resided in Milan for twelve years, moving in the city's literary and artistic circles and, in 1834, helped to organise the ''Salotto Maffei'' [[salon (gathering)|salon]], hosted by [[Clara Maffei]]. He became an intimate of [[Alessandro Manzoni]] the novelist, whose daughter he married. At that point, literature instead of art became his chief occupation; he produced two historical novels, ''Niccol\u00f2 dei Lapi'' and ''[[Ettore Fieramosca (novel)|Ettore Fieramosca]]'', in imitation of [[Walter Scott]]. The novels had a strong political context, with d'Azeglio aiming to illustrate the evils of foreign domination in Italy and to reawaken national feeling.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1845 d'Azeglio visited [[Romagna]] as an unauthorized political envoy, to report on its conditions and the troubles which he foresaw would break out on the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. The following year he published his famous pamphlet ''Degli ultimi casi di Romagna'' at [[Florence]]; as a consequence of this he was expelled from [[Tuscany]]. He spent the next few months in Rome, sharing the general enthusiasm over the supposed liberalism of the new pope, [[pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]; like [[Vincenzo Gioberti]] he believed in an Italian confederation under papal auspices and was opposed to the Radical wing of the Liberal party. His political activity increased and he wrote various other pamphlets, among which was ''I lutti di Lombardia'' (1848).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn the outbreak of the first war of independence, d'Azeglio donned the papal uniform and took part under General Durando in the defence of [[Vicenza]], where he was severely wounded. He retired to Florence to recover, but as he opposed the ruling democrats he was expelled from Tuscany a second time. He was now a famous man, and early in 1849 [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert, king of Sardinia]], invited him to form a cabinet. Realizing how impossible it was to renew the campaign, but \"not having the heart to sign, in such wretched internal and external conditions, a treaty of peace with Austria\" (''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'', by E Rendu), he refused.<!-- This last sentence is not clear -->{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Prime Minister of Sardinia==\n[[File:Francesco Hayez - Ritratto di Massimo d\u2019Azeglio.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Massimo D'Azeglio portraited by [[Francesco Hayez]] (1860).]]\nAfter the defeat at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] (23 March 1849), Charles Albert abdicated and was succeeded by [[Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel II]]. D'Azeglio was again called on to form a cabinet; this time, although the situation was even more difficult, he accepted, concluded a peace treaty, dissolved the Chamber and summoned a new one to ratify it. The treaty was accepted and d'Azeglio continued in office for the next three years. While all the rest of Italy was a prey to despotism, in Piedmont the king maintained the constitution intact in the face of a general wave of reaction.

Rowden was an engaging teacher, a poet, and had a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. According to [[Mary Russell Mitford]], \"she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=eds|first1=Lilla Maria Crisafulli & Cecilia Pietropoli|title=The languages of performance in British romanticism|date=2008|publisher=P. Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-3039110971|page=301|edition=Oxford; Bern; Berlin; Frankfurt am Main; Wien$nLang.|chapter=appendix}}</ref> Other Rowden's pupils were: Caroline Ponsonby, later [[Lady Caroline Lamb]];  [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], the travel writer; [[Anna Maria Hall|Anna Maria Fielding]], who published as Mrs S. C. Hall; and Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who married [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] and published her many novels as [[Rosina Bulwer Lytton]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=T. A.

Letitia was educated at home by her older cousin Elizabeth from that point on.<ref name=DNB /> Elizabeth found her knowledge and abilities outstripped by those of her pupil: \"When I asked Letitia any question relating either to history, geography, grammar \u2013 [[Plutarch's Lives|Plutarch's ''Lives'']], or to any book we had been reading, I was pretty certain her answers would be perfectly correct; still, not exactly recollecting, and unwilling she should find out just then that I was less learned than herself, I used thus to question her: 'Are you quite certain?' ... I never knew her to be wrong.\"<ref>Qtd. in Wu (2006), 1442.</ref> \n\nWhen young, Letitia was close to her younger brother, Whittington Henry, born 1804. Paying for university education for him, at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], was one of the reasons that brought Letitia to publish. She also supported his preferment and later dedicated her poem \"Captain Cook\" to their childhood days together. Whittington went on to become a minister and published a book of sermons in 1835. Rather than showing appreciation for his sister's assistance, he spread rumours about her marriage and death. Letitia also had a younger sister, Elizabeth Jane (born 1806), who was a frail child and died in 1819, aged just 13. Little is known of Elizabeth but her death may well have left a profound impression on Letitia and it could be Elizabeth who is referred to in the poem \"The Forgotten One\" (\"I have no early flowers to fling\").\n\n== Literary career ==\nAn agricultural depression meant that the Landon family moved back to London in 1815. There John Landon made the acquaintance of [[William Jerdan]], editor of the ''[[Literary Gazette]]''.<ref name=DNB /> According to [[Mrs A. T. Thomson]], Jerdan took notice of the young Letitia Landon when he saw her coming down the street, \"trundling a hoop with one hand, and holding in the other a book of poems, of which she was catching a glimpse between the agitating course of her evolutions\".<ref>Thomson (1860), 145.</ref> Jerdan later described her ideas as \"original and extraordinary\". He encouraged Landon's poetic endeavours, and her first poem was published under the single initial \"L\" in the ''Gazette'' in 1820, when Landon was 18. The following year, with financial support from her grandmother, Landon published a book of poetry, ''The Fate of Adelaide'', under her full name.<ref name=DNB /> The book met with little critical notice,<ref name=DNB /> but sold well; Landon, however, received no profits, since the publisher shortly went out of business.<ref>Thomson (1860), 151.</ref> The same month that ''The Fate of Adelaide'' appeared, Landon published two poems under the initials \"L.E.L.\" in the ''Gazette;'' these poems, and the initials under which they were published, attracted much discussion and speculation.<ref name=DNB /> As contemporary critic [[Laman Blanchard]] put it, the initials L.E.L. \"speedily became a signature of magical interest and curiosity\".<ref>Quoted in Byron (2004).</ref> [[Bulwer Lytton]] wrote that, as a young college student, he and his classmates would\n\n<blockquote>rush every Saturday afternoon for the ''Literary Gazette'', [with] an impatient anxiety to hasten at once to that corner of the sheet which contained the three magical letters L.E.L. And all of us praised the verse, and all of us guessed at the author. We soon learned it was a female, and our admiration was doubled, and our conjectures tripled.<ref>Quoted in Thomson (1860), 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:John Forster detail.jpg|right|thumb|John Forster, to whom Landon was briefly engaged]]\n\nLandon served as the ''Gazette'''s chief reviewer as she continued to write poetry; her second collection, ''The Improvisatrice'', appeared in 1824.<ref name=DNB /> Her father died later that year, and she was forced to write to support her family;<ref name=T153>Thomson (1860), 153.</ref> Contemporaries saw this profit-motive as detrimental to the quality of Landon's work:<ref name=T153 /> a woman was not supposed to be a professional writer. [[Mary Mitford]] claimed that the novels of [[Catherine Stepney]] were honed and polished by Landon.<ref name=oxfordcs>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26403?docPos=2 Catherine Stepney],  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, retrieved 5 December 2014</ref>\n\nBy 1826, Landon's reputation began to suffer as rumours circulated that she had had affairs or secretly borne children. She continued to publish poetry, and in 1831 her first novel, ''Romance and Reality''. She became engaged to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]]. Forster became aware of the rumours regarding Landon's sexual activity, and asked her to refute them. Landon responded that Forster should \"make every inquiry in [his] power\",<ref name=T164>Thomson (1860), 164.</ref> which Forster did; after he pronounced himself satisfied, however, Landon broke off their engagement. To him, she wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The more I think, the more I feel I ought not \u2013 I can not \u2013 allow you to unite yourself with one accused of \u2013 I can not write it. The mere suspicion is dreadful as death. Were it stated as a fact, that might be disproved. Were it a difficulty of any other kind, I might say, Look back at every action of my life, ask every friend I have. But what answer can I give ... ? I feel that to give up all idea of a near and dear connection is as much my duty to myself as to you....<ref>Thomson (1860), 165.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPrivately, Landon stated that she would never marry a man who had mistrusted her.<ref name=T164 /> In a letter to Bulwer Lytton, she wrote that \"if his future protection is to harass and humiliate me as much as his present \u2013 God keep me from it ... I cannot get over the entire want of delicacy to me which could repeat such slander to myself.\"<ref name=DNB />\n\n==Later life==\nLandon began to \"[talk] of marrying any one, and of wishing to get away, from England, and from those who had thus misunderstood her\".<ref>Thomson (1860), 166.</ref> In October 1836, Landon met [[George Maclean]], [[List_of_governors_of_the_Gold_Coast#Governors_of_the_Committee_of_Merchants_of_the_Gold_Coast_(1828\u20131843)|governor]] of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), at a dinner party given by [[Matthew Forster]], and the two began a relationship. Maclean, however, moved to Scotland early the following year, to the surprise and distress of Landon and her friends. After much prodding, Maclean returned to England and he and Landon were married shortly thereafter, on 7 June 1838.<ref name=DNB /> The marriage was kept secret, and Landon spent the first month of it living with friends. Her schoolfriend Emma Roberts wrote of Maclean:<ref name=\"Roberts1839\"/>\n\n<blockquote>No one could better appreciate than L.E.L. the high and sterling qualities of her lover's character, his philanthropic and unceasing endeavours to improve the condition of the natives of Africa; the noble manner in which he interfered to prevent the horrid waste of human life by the barbarian princes in his neighbourhood; and the chivalric energy with which he strove to put an end to the slave-trade. L.E.L. esteemed Mr Maclean the more, in consequence of his not approaching her with the adulation with which her ear had been accustomed, to satiety; she was gratified by the manly nature of his attachment. Possessing, in her estimation, merits of the highest order, the influence which he gained over her promised, in the opinion of those who were best acquainted with the docility of her temper, and her ready acquiescence with the wishes of those she loved, to ensure lasting happiness.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:George Maclean.png|right|thumb|George Maclean, Letitia's husband]]\n\nIn early July, the couple sailed for Cape Coast, where they arrived on 16 August 1838.<ref name=DNB />\n\nIn ''[[Retrospect of a Long Life]]'', [[Samuel C. Hall]] writes of Landon's marriage and husband in very negative terms. \"Her marriage wrecked her life; but before that fatal mistake was made, slander had been busy with her fair fame\" (Retrospect, p. 395). Landon had taken \"refuge from [slander] . . . in union with a man utterly incapable of appreciating her or making her happy, and [she] went out with him to his government at the Gold Coast -- to die\" (ibid.). Her death was \"not even -- tragical as such an ending would have been . . . to wither before the pestilential influences that steam up from that wilderness of swamp and jungle\" but rather \"to die a violent death -- a fearful one\" (ibid.). Here Hall asserts his belief that Landon was murdered by her husband's common-law wife: \"unhappy 'L.E.L.' was murdered I have had a doubt. . . . She landed at Cape Coast Castle in July, 1838, and on the 15th of October she was dead . . . from having accidentally taken a dose of prussic acid. But where was she to have procured that poison? . . . .It was not among the contents of the medicine-chest she took out from England\" (ibid., pp. 395-396). Rather, claims Hall, after arriving in Africa, \"Maclean left her on board while he went to arrange matters on shore. A negro woman was there, with four or five children -- his children; she had to be sent into the interior to make room for her legitimate successor. It is understood the negress was the daughter of a king . . . [and] from the moment 'L.E.L.' landed her life was at the mercy of her rival; that by her hand she was done to death I am all but certain\" (ibid., p. 396).\n\nIn fact Maclean's local mistress had left for Accra long before their arrival, as was confirmed by later interviews with her. His going ashore was most likely to ensure that the accommodation arranged for his new wife was in a healthy condition. The date on her prescription for dilute prussic acid was 1836, probably given when she was first diagnosed as having a critical heart condition.<ref>Julie Watt</ref> Letitia told her husband that her life depended on it.\n\nMost of Hall's accounts are based on the fantastic stories invented by the press following Mrs Maclean's death and have little or no basis in fact.<ref>Julie Watt</ref>\n\n==Death==\nTwo months later, on 15 October 1838, Landon was found dead, a bottle of [[prussic acid]] in her hand.<ref name=DNB /> That she was poisoned was an assumption. There is evidence that she showed symptoms of [[Stokes-Adams syndrome]] for which the dilute acid was the standard remedy. No autopsy was carried out (there being no qualified pathologist available) but from the eye-witness accounts it has been argued that Landon suffered a fatal convulsion.<ref>Watt (2010)</ref> Hall notes in ''[[Retrospect of a Long Life|Retrospect]]'' that Maclean refused Hall's attempts to erect a statue in honour of Landon, and that her funeral services were shrouded in secrecy: \"on the evening of her death she was buried in the courtyard of Cape Coast Castle. The grave was dug by torchlight amid a pitiless torrent of rain\" (Retrospect, pp. 397-398). \"Mrs. Hall and I strove to raise money to place a monument there; but objection was made, and the project was abandoned. Lady Blessington directed a slab to be placed at her expense on the wall. That, also, was objected to. But her husband, for very shame, at last permitted it to be done, and a mural table records that in that African courtyard rests all that is mortal of Letitia Elizabeth Maclean\" (ibid., p. 398).\n\nIn fact, the immediate burial was due to the climate and all the European residents attended with William Topp reading the funeral service. The sudden tropical rainstorm came subsequently during the preparation of the grave.<ref>Julie Watt</ref> Blanchard states that 'It was the immediate wish of Mr. Maclean to place above this grave a suitable memorial, and his desire was expressed in the earliest letter which he sent to England; but we believe that some delay took place in the execution of the order he issued, from the necessity of referring back to the Coast for information as to the intended site of the monument, in order that it might be prepared accordingly. \"A handsome marble tablet\" is now, it appears, on its way to Cape Coast, to be erected in the castle.'<ref>Blanchard (1841)</ref> Neither Hall nor Lady Blessington had any part in it, although Lady Blessington was hoping to erect a memorial in Brompton.<ref>Julie Watt</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#FCE6C9; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Do you think of me as I think of you,<br />\nMy friends, my friends?\" She said it from the sea,<br />\t\nThe English minstrel in her minstrelsy,<br />\nWhile under brighter skies than erst she knew<br />\t\nHer heart grew dark, and groped as the blind,<br />\nTo touch, across the waves, friends left behind \u2013 <br />\n\"Do you think of me as I think of you?\"<br />\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | <small>From \"L.E.L.'s Last Question,\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1844)<ref>Qtd. in Armstrong and Bristow (1998), 286.</ref></small>\n|}\n\n== Character sketches ==\nLandon's appearance and personality were described by a number of her friends and contemporaries:\n\n[[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], from her introduction to \"The Zenana and other works\":<ref name=\"Roberts1839\">Roberts(1839)</ref>\n<blockquote>\nL.E.L. could not be, strictly speaking, called handsome; her eyes being the only good feature in a countenance, which was, however, so animated, and lighted up with such intellectual expression, as to be exceedingly attractive. Gay and piquant, her clear complexion, dark hair, and eyes, rendered her, when in health and spirits, a sparkling brunette. The prettiness of L.E.L., though generally acknowledged, was not talked about; and many persons, on their first introduction, were as pleasingly surprised as the Ettrick Shepherd, who, gazing upon her with great admiration, exclaimed \"I did na think ye had been sae bonny.\" Her figure was slight, and beautifully proportioned, with little hands and feet; and these personal advantages, added to her kind and endearing manners, rendered her exceedingly fascinating.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Letitia Elizabeth Landon - Pickersgill.png|right|thumb|Landon, from the cover of William Jerdan's Autobiography, 1852. Vol. 3<br>Portrait by Pickersgill]]\n\nWilliam Jerdan, from his autobiography:<ref>Jerdan (1852\u20133)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In truth, she was the most unselfish of human creatures; and it was quite extraordinary to witness her ceaseless consideration for the feelings of others, even in minute trifles, whilst her own mind was probably troubled and oppressed; a sweet disposition, so perfectly amiable, from Nature's fount, and so unalterable in its manifestations throughout her entire life, that every one who enjoyed her society loved her, and servants, companions, intimates, friends, all united in esteem and affection for the gentle and self-sacrificing being who never exhibited a single trait of egotism, presumption, or unkindliness!</blockquote>\n\n[[Anna Maria Hall]], from ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'':<ref>Hall(1865)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps the greatest magic she exercised was, that, after the first rush of remembrance of all that wonderful young woman had written had subsided, she rendered you completely oblivious of what she had done by the irresistible charm of what she was. You forgot all about her books, \u2013 you only felt the intense delight of life with her; she was penetrating and sympathetic, and entered into your feelings so entirely that you wondered how \"the little witch\" could read you so readily and so rightly, \u2013 and if, now and then, you were startled, perhaps dismayed, by her wit, it was but the prick of a diamond arrow. Words and thoughts that she flung hither and thither, without design or intent beyond the amusement of the moment, come to me still with a mingled thrill of pleasure and pain that I cannot describe, and that my most friendly readers, not having known her, could not understand.</blockquote>\n\n[[Anne Elwood]], from her ''Memoirs of Literary Ladies'':<ref>Elwood(1843)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It was her invariable habit to write in her bed-room, \u2013 \"a homely-looking, almost uncomfortable room, fronting the street, and barely furnished \u2013 with a simple white bed, at the foot of which was a small, old, oblong-shaped sort of dressing-table, quite covered with a common worn writing-desk, heaped with papers, while some strewed the ground, the table being too small for aught besides the desk. A little high-backed cane chair, which gave you any idea but that of comfort, and a few books scattered about, completed the author's paraphernalia.\"</blockquote>\n\nEmma Roberts again:<ref name=\"Roberts1839\"/>\n\n<blockquote>She not only read, but thoroughly understood, and entered into the merits of every book that came out; while it is merely necessary to refer to her printed works, to calculate the amount of information which she had gathered from preceding authors. The history and literature of all ages and all countries were familiar to her; nor did she acquire any portion of her knowledge in a superficial manner; the extent of her learning, and the depth of her research, manifesting themselves in publications which do not bear her name; her claim to them being only known to friends, who, like myself, had access to her desk, and with whom she knew the secret might be safely trusted.</blockquote>\n\nHer depth of reading is confirmed by Laman Blanchard in his Life, who states:<ref>Blanchard(1841)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To those who, looking at the quantity of her published prose and poetry, might wonder how she found time for all these private and unproductive exercises of her pen, it may be desirable to explain, not merely that she wrote, but that she read, with remarkable rapidity. Books, indeed, of the highest character, she would dwell upon with \"amorous delay;\" but those of ordinary interest, or the nine-day wonders of literature, she would run through in a much shorter space of time than would seem consistent with that thorough understanding of their contents at which she always arrived, or with that accurate observation of the less striking features which she would generally prove to have been bestowed, by reference almost to the very page in which they might be noted. Of some work which she scarcely seemed to have glanced through, she would give an elaborate and succinct account, pointing out the gaps in the plot, or the discrepancies in the characters, and supporting her judgment by all but verbatim quotations.</blockquote>\n\nOther contemporaries also praised Landon's exceptionally high level of intelligence. Fredric Rowton, in ''The Female Poets of Great Britain'', put it thus:<ref>Rowton(1848)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Of Mrs Maclean's genius there can be but one opinion. It is distinguished by very great intellectual power, a highly sensitive and ardent imagination, an intense fervour of passionate emotion, and almost unequalled eloquence and fluency. Of mere art she displays but little. Her style is irregular and careless, and her painting sketchy and rough but there is genius in every line she has written.</blockquote>\n\n(Like many others, Rowton is deceived by the artistry of Landon's projection of herself as the improvisatrice, L. E. L. As [[Glennis Stevenson]] writes, few poets have been as artificial as Landon in her \"gushing stream of Song\". She cites the usage of repetition, mirroring and the embedding of texts amongst the techniques that account for the characteristic intensity of Landon's poetry.)\n\n== Reputation ==\nAmong the poets of her own time to recognise and admire Landon were [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], who wrote \"L.E.L.'s Last Question\" in homage; and [[Christina Rossetti]], who published a tribute poem entitled \"L.E.L\" in her 1866 volume ''The Prince's Progress and Other Poems''.\n\nLandon's reputation, while high in the 19th century, fell during most of the 20th as literary fashions changed: her poetry was perceived as overly simple and sentimental. In recent years, however, scholars and critics have increasingly studied her work, beginning with [[Germaine Greer]]<ref>Greer, Germaine. ''Slip-shod Sybils''</ref> in the 1970s. Critics such as [[Isobel Armstrong]] argue that the supposed simplicity of poetry such as Landon's is deceptive, and that women poets of the 19th century often employed a method of writing which allows for multiple, concurrent levels of meaning.<ref>Armstrong, Isobel. \"The Gush of the Feminine\".</ref> Such criticism had already been addressed by Sarah Sheppard in her \"Characteristics of the Genius and Writings of L E L\" of 1841.<ref>Letitia Elizabeth Landon at Corvey Writers on the Web</ref> Her opening paragraph runs:\n\n<blockquote>Because they whose decision it is, are subjects of the superficial spirit of the age, which leaves them unacquainted with all of which it appoints them judges. Because, either from a dislike of trouble, or inability to pursue the inquiry, these judges never deviate from their own beaten right line to observe how genius acts and is acted upon,\u2014how it is influenced, and what effects it produces on society. Hence the mistaken opinions concerning literary characters one is often compelled to hear from those who, it is to be feared, know little of what they affirm; and of literary works from those who, it is also to be feared, are not competent to decide on their merits. It is indeed strange with what decision people set their seal of condemnation on volumes beyond whose title-pages they have scarcely looked.</blockquote>\n\nHer ideas and the diversity of her poetry engendered a \"Landon School\", in England but also in America.<ref>Dibert-Himes</ref> As for style, William Howitt comments: \"This is one singular peculiarity of the poetry of L. E. L.; and her poetry must be confessed to be peculiar. It is entirely her own. It had one prominent and fixed character, and that character belonged solely to itself. The rhythm, the feeling, the style and phraseology of L. E. L.'s poetry, were such, that you could immediately recognize it, though the writer's name was not mentioned.\"<ref>Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840</ref>\n\nA tribute in ''The London Literary Gazette'', following Landon's death, ran:\n\n<blockquote>To express what we feel on her loss is impossible \u2013 and private sorrows of so deep a kind are not for public display: her name will descend to the most distant times, as one of the brightest in the annals of English literature; and whether after ages look at the glowing purity and nature of her first poems, or the more sustained thoughtfulness and vigour of her later works, in prose or in verse, they will cherish her memory as that of one of the most beloved of female authors, the pride and glory of our country while she lived, and the undying delight of succeeding generations. Then, as in our day, young hearts will beat responsive to the thrilling touch of her music; her song of love will find a sacred home in many a fair and ingenuous bosom; her numbers, which breathed of the finest humanities, her playfulness of spirit, and her wonderful delineation of character and society \u2013 all \u2013 all will be admired, but not lamented as now. She is gone; and, oh, what a light of mind is extinguished: what an amount of friendship and of love has gone down into the grave!</blockquote>\n\n== List of works ==\n[[File:\"The Love Letter\" painting by Henry James Richter.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Henry James Richter]], depicting a scene from [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), executed between 1816 and 1832.

She also assumed the occasional pseudonym: for one, she adopted the name Iole for a period from 1825\u201327. Two of her Iole poems, \"The Wreck\" and \"The Frozen Ship\", were later included in the collection, ''The Vow of the Peacock''. On her death, she left a list of projected works. Besides \"Lady Anne Granard\" (first volume completed) and her \"tragedy\" (Castruccio Catrucani), there were: a critical work in 3 volumes to be called \"Female Portrait Gallery in Modern Literature\" for which she says she has collected a vast amount of material (only some portraits based on [[Walter Scott]] were produced); a romance called \"Charlotte Corday\" for which a plan was sketched plus a \"chapter or two\"; and a projected 2 volume work on \"travels in the country I am about to visit, including the history of the slave trade of which I shall [have] the opportunity of collecting so many curious facts\".<ref>Adriana Craciun</ref>\n\n* ''The Fate of Adelaide.

Rowden was an engaging teacher, a poet, and had a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. According to [[Mary Russell Mitford]], \"she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=eds|first1=Lilla Maria Crisafulli & Cecilia Pietropoli|title=The languages of performance in British romanticism|date=2008|publisher=P. Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-3039110971|page=301|edition=Oxford; Bern; Berlin; Frankfurt am Main; Wien$nLang.|chapter=appendix}}</ref> Other Rowden's pupils were: Caroline Ponsonby, later [[Lady Caroline Lamb]];  [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], the travel writer; [[Anna Maria Hall|Anna Maria Fielding]], who published as Mrs S. C. Hall; and Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who married [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] and published her many novels as [[Rosina Bulwer Lytton]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=T. A. B.|last=Corley|title=Rowden [married name de St Quentin], Frances Arabella (1774\u20131840?), schoolmistress and poet|id=59581}||access-date=7 January 2018|language=en}}</ref> \n\nThe Landons moved to the country in 1809, so that John Landon could carry out a [[model farm]] project. Letitia was educated at home by her older cousin Elizabeth from that point on.<ref name=DNB /> Elizabeth found her knowledge and abilities outstripped by those of her pupil: \"When I asked Letitia any question relating either to history, geography, grammar \u2013 [[Plutarch's Lives|Plutarch's ''Lives'']], or to any book we had been reading, I was pretty certain her answers would be perfectly correct; still, not exactly recollecting, and unwilling she should find out just then that I was less learned than herself, I used thus to question her: 'Are you quite certain?' ... I never knew her to be wrong.\"<ref>Qtd. in Wu (2006), 1442.</ref> \n\nWhen young, Letitia was close to her younger brother, Whittington Henry, born 1804. Paying for university education for him, at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], was one of the reasons that brought Letitia to publish. She also supported his preferment and later dedicated her poem \"Captain Cook\" to their childhood days together. Whittington went on to become a minister and published a book of sermons in 1835. Rather than showing appreciation for his sister's assistance, he spread rumours about her marriage and death. Letitia also had a younger sister, Elizabeth Jane (born 1806), who was a frail child and died in 1819, aged just 13. Little is known of Elizabeth but her death may well have left a profound impression on Letitia and it could be Elizabeth who is referred to in the poem \"The Forgotten One\" (\"I have no early flowers to fling\").\n\n== Literary career ==\nAn agricultural depression meant that the Landon family moved back to London in 1815. There John Landon made the acquaintance of [[William Jerdan]], editor of the ''[[Literary Gazette]]''.<ref name=DNB /> According to [[Mrs A. T. Thomson]], Jerdan took notice of the young Letitia Landon when he saw her coming down the street, \"trundling a hoop with one hand, and holding in the other a book of poems, of which she was catching a glimpse between the agitating course of her evolutions\".<ref>Thomson (1860), 145.</ref> Jerdan later described her ideas as \"original and extraordinary\". He encouraged Landon's poetic endeavours, and her first poem was published under the single initial \"L\" in the ''Gazette'' in 1820, when Landon was 18. The following year, with financial support from her grandmother, Landon published a book of poetry, ''The Fate of Adelaide'', under her full name.<ref name=DNB /> The book met with little critical notice,<ref name=DNB /> but sold well; Landon, however, received no profits, since the publisher shortly went out of business.<ref>Thomson (1860), 151.</ref> The same month that ''The Fate of Adelaide'' appeared, Landon published two poems under the initials \"L.E.L.\" in the ''Gazette;'' these poems, and the initials under which they were published, attracted much discussion and speculation.<ref name=DNB /> As contemporary critic [[Laman Blanchard]] put it, the initials L.E.L. \"speedily became a signature of magical interest and curiosity\".<ref>Quoted in Byron (2004).</ref> [[Bulwer Lytton]] wrote that, as a young college student, he and his classmates would\n\n<blockquote>rush every Saturday afternoon for the ''Literary Gazette'', [with] an impatient anxiety to hasten at once to that corner of the sheet which contained the three magical letters L.E.L. And all of us praised the verse, and all of us guessed at the author. We soon learned it was a female, and our admiration was doubled, and our conjectures tripled.<ref>Quoted in Thomson (1860), 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:John Forster detail.jpg|right|thumb|John Forster, to whom Landon was briefly engaged]]\n\nLandon served as the ''Gazette'''s chief reviewer as she continued to write poetry; her second collection, ''The Improvisatrice'', appeared in 1824.<ref name=DNB /> Her father died later that year, and she was forced to write to support her family;<ref name=T153>Thomson (1860), 153.</ref> Contemporaries saw this profit-motive as detrimental to the quality of Landon's work:<ref name=T153 /> a woman was not supposed to be a professional writer. [[Mary Mitford]] claimed that the novels of [[Catherine Stepney]] were honed and polished by Landon.<ref name=oxfordcs>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26403?docPos=2 Catherine Stepney],  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, retrieved 5 December 2014</ref>\n\nBy 1826, Landon's reputation began to suffer as rumours circulated that she had had affairs or secretly borne children. She continued to publish poetry, and in 1831 her first novel, ''Romance and Reality''. She became engaged to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]]. Forster became aware of the rumours regarding Landon's sexual activity, and asked her to refute them. Landon responded that Forster should \"make every inquiry in [his] power\",<ref name=T164>Thomson (1860), 164.</ref> which Forster did; after he pronounced himself satisfied, however, Landon broke off their engagement. To him, she wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The more I think, the more I feel I ought not \u2013 I can not \u2013 allow you to unite yourself with one accused of \u2013 I can not write it. The mere suspicion is dreadful as death. Were it stated as a fact, that might be disproved. Were it a difficulty of any other kind, I might say, Look back at every action of my life, ask every friend I have. But what answer can I give ... ? I feel that to give up all idea of a near and dear connection is as much my duty to myself as to you....<ref>Thomson (1860), 165.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPrivately, Landon stated that she would never marry a man who had mistrusted her.<ref name=T164 /> In a letter to Bulwer Lytton, she wrote that \"if his future protection is to harass and humiliate me as much as his present \u2013 God keep me from it ... I cannot get over the entire want of delicacy to me which could repeat such slander to myself.\"<ref name=DNB />\n\n==Later life==\nLandon began to \"[talk] of marrying any one, and of wishing to get away, from England, and from those who had thus misunderstood her\".<ref>Thomson (1860), 166.</ref> In October 1836, Landon met [[George Maclean]], [[List_of_governors_of_the_Gold_Coast#Governors_of_the_Committee_of_Merchants_of_the_Gold_Coast_(1828\u20131843)|governor]] of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), at a dinner party given by [[Matthew Forster]], and the two began a relationship. Maclean, however, moved to Scotland early the following year, to the surprise and distress of Landon and her friends. After much prodding, Maclean returned to England and he and Landon were married shortly thereafter, on 7 June 1838.<ref name=DNB /> The marriage was kept secret, and Landon spent the first month of it living with friends. Her schoolfriend Emma Roberts wrote of Maclean:<ref name=\"Roberts1839\"/>\n\n<blockquote>No one could better appreciate than L.E.L. the high and sterling qualities of her lover's character, his philanthropic and unceasing endeavours to improve the condition of the natives of Africa; the noble manner in which he interfered to prevent the horrid waste of human life by the barbarian princes in his neighbourhood; and the chivalric energy with which he strove to put an end to the slave-trade. L.E.L. esteemed Mr Maclean the more, in consequence of his not approaching her with the adulation with which her ear had been accustomed, to satiety; she was gratified by the manly nature of his attachment. Possessing, in her estimation, merits of the highest order, the influence which he gained over her promised, in the opinion of those who were best acquainted with the docility of her temper, and her ready acquiescence with the wishes of those she loved, to ensure lasting happiness.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:George Maclean.png|right|thumb|George Maclean, Letitia's husband]]\n\nIn early July, the couple sailed for Cape Coast, where they arrived on 16 August 1838.<ref name=DNB />\n\nIn ''[[Retrospect of a Long Life]]'', [[Samuel C. Hall]] writes of Landon's marriage and husband in very negative terms. \"Her marriage wrecked her life; but before that fatal mistake was made, slander had been busy with her fair fame\" (Retrospect, p. 395). Landon had taken \"refuge from [slander] . . . in union with a man utterly incapable of appreciating her or making her happy, and [she] went out with him to his government at the Gold Coast -- to die\" (ibid.). Her death was \"not even -- tragical as such an ending would have been . . . to wither before the pestilential influences that steam up from that wilderness of swamp and jungle\" but rather \"to die a violent death -- a fearful one\" (ibid.). Here Hall asserts his belief that Landon was murdered by her husband's common-law wife: \"unhappy 'L.E.L.' was murdered I have had a doubt. . . . She landed at Cape Coast Castle in July, 1838, and on the 15th of October she was dead . . . from having accidentally taken a dose of prussic acid. But where was she to have procured that poison? . . . .It was not among the contents of the medicine-chest she took out from England\" (ibid., pp. 395-396). Rather, claims Hall, after arriving in Africa, \"Maclean left her on board while he went to arrange matters on shore. A negro woman was there, with four or five children -- his children; she had to be sent into the interior to make room for her legitimate successor. It is understood the negress was the daughter of a king . . . [and] from the moment 'L.E.L.' landed her life was at the mercy of her rival; that by her hand she was done to death I am all but certain\" (ibid., p. 396).\n\nIn fact Maclean's local mistress had left for Accra long before their arrival, as was confirmed by later interviews with her. His going ashore was most likely to ensure that the accommodation arranged for his new wife was in a healthy condition. The date on her prescription for dilute prussic acid was 1836, probably given when she was first diagnosed as having a critical heart condition.<ref>Julie Watt</ref> Letitia told her husband that her life depended on it.\n\nMost of Hall's accounts are based on the fantastic stories invented by the press following Mrs Maclean's death and have little or no basis in fact.<ref>Julie Watt</ref>\n\n==Death==\nTwo months later, on 15 October 1838, Landon was found dead, a bottle of [[prussic acid]] in her hand.<ref name=DNB /> That she was poisoned was an assumption. There is evidence that she showed symptoms of [[Stokes-Adams syndrome]] for which the dilute acid was the standard remedy. No autopsy was carried out (there being no qualified pathologist available) but from the eye-witness accounts it has been argued that Landon suffered a fatal convulsion.<ref>Watt (2010)</ref> Hall notes in ''[[Retrospect]]'' that Maclean refused Hall's attempts to erect a statue in honour of Landon, and that her funeral services were shrouded in secrecy: \"on the evening of her death she was buried in the courtyard of Cape Coast Castle. The grave was dug by torchlight amid a pitiless torrent of rain\" (Retrospect, pp. 397-398). \"Mrs. Hall and I strove to raise money to place a monument there; but objection was made, and the project was abandoned. Lady Blessington directed a slab to be placed at her expense on the wall. That, also, was objected to. But her husband, for very shame, at last permitted it to be done, and a mural table records that in that African courtyard rests all that is mortal of Letitia Elizabeth Maclean\" (ibid., p. 398).\n\nIn fact, the immediate burial was due to the climate and all the European residents attended with William Topp reading the funeral service. The sudden tropical rainstorm came subsequently during the preparation of the grave.<ref>Julie Watt</ref> Blanchard states that 'It was the immediate wish of Mr. Maclean to place above this grave a suitable memorial, and his desire was expressed in the earliest letter which he sent to England; but we believe that some delay took place in the execution of the order he issued, from the necessity of referring back to the Coast for information as to the intended site of the monument, in order that it might be prepared accordingly. \"A handsome marble tablet\" is now, it appears, on its way to Cape Coast, to be erected in the castle.'<ref>Blanchard (1841)</ref> Neither Hall nor Lady Blessington had any part in it, although Lady Blessington was hoping to erect a memorial in Brompton.<ref>Julie Watt</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#FCE6C9; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Do you think of me as I think of you,<br />\nMy friends, my friends?\" She said it from the sea,<br />\t\nThe English minstrel in her minstrelsy,<br />\nWhile under brighter skies than erst she knew<br />\t\nHer heart grew dark, and groped as the blind,<br />\nTo touch, across the waves, friends left behind \u2013 <br />\n\"Do you think of me as I think of you?\"<br />\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | <small>From \"L.E.L.'s Last Question,\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1844)<ref>Qtd. in Armstrong and Bristow (1998), 286.</ref></small>\n|}\n\n== Character sketches ==\nLandon's appearance and personality were described by a number of her friends and contemporaries:\n\n[[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], from her introduction to \"The Zenana and other works\":<ref name=\"Roberts1839\">Roberts(1839)</ref>\n<blockquote>\nL.E.L. could not be, strictly speaking, called handsome; her eyes being the only good feature in a countenance, which was, however, so animated, and lighted up with such intellectual expression, as to be exceedingly attractive. Gay and piquant, her clear complexion, dark hair, and eyes, rendered her, when in health and spirits, a sparkling brunette. The prettiness of L.E.L., though generally acknowledged, was not talked about; and many persons, on their first introduction, were as pleasingly surprised as the Ettrick Shepherd, who, gazing upon her with great admiration, exclaimed \"I did na think ye had been sae bonny.\" Her figure was slight, and beautifully proportioned, with little hands and feet; and these personal advantages, added to her kind and endearing manners, rendered her exceedingly fascinating.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Letitia Elizabeth Landon - Pickersgill.png|right|thumb|Landon, from the cover of William Jerdan's Autobiography, 1852. Vol. 3<br>Portrait by Pickersgill]]\n\nWilliam Jerdan, from his autobiography:<ref>Jerdan (1852\u20133)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In truth, she was the most unselfish of human creatures; and it was quite extraordinary to witness her ceaseless consideration for the feelings of others, even in minute trifles, whilst her own mind was probably troubled and oppressed; a sweet disposition, so perfectly amiable, from Nature's fount, and so unalterable in its manifestations throughout her entire life, that every one who enjoyed her society loved her, and servants, companions, intimates, friends, all united in esteem and affection for the gentle and self-sacrificing being who never exhibited a single trait of egotism, presumption, or unkindliness!</blockquote>\n\n[[Anna Maria Hall]], from ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'':<ref>Hall(1865)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps the greatest magic she exercised was, that, after the first rush of remembrance of all that wonderful young woman had written had subsided, she rendered you completely oblivious of what she had done by the irresistible charm of what she was. You forgot all about her books, \u2013 you only felt the intense delight of life with her; she was penetrating and sympathetic, and entered into your feelings so entirely that you wondered how \"the little witch\" could read you so readily and so rightly, \u2013 and if, now and then, you were startled, perhaps dismayed, by her wit, it was but the prick of a diamond arrow. Words and thoughts that she flung hither and thither, without design or intent beyond the amusement of the moment, come to me still with a mingled thrill of pleasure and pain that I cannot describe, and that my most friendly readers, not having known her, could not understand.</blockquote>\n\n[[Anne Elwood]], from her ''Memoirs of Literary Ladies'':<ref>Elwood(1843)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It was her invariable habit to write in her bed-room, \u2013 \"a homely-looking, almost uncomfortable room, fronting the street, and barely furnished \u2013 with a simple white bed, at the foot of which was a small, old, oblong-shaped sort of dressing-table, quite covered with a common worn writing-desk, heaped with papers, while some strewed the ground, the table being too small for aught besides the desk. A little high-backed cane chair, which gave you any idea but that of comfort, and a few books scattered about, completed the author's paraphernalia.\"</blockquote>\n\nEmma Roberts again:<ref name=\"Roberts1839\"/>\n\n<blockquote>She not only read, but thoroughly understood, and entered into the merits of every book that came out; while it is merely necessary to refer to her printed works, to calculate the amount of information which she had gathered from preceding authors. The history and literature of all ages and all countries were familiar to her; nor did she acquire any portion of her knowledge in a superficial manner; the extent of her learning, and the depth of her research, manifesting themselves in publications which do not bear her name; her claim to them being only known to friends, who, like myself, had access to her desk, and with whom she knew the secret might be safely trusted.</blockquote>\n\nHer depth of reading is confirmed by Laman Blanchard in his Life, who states:<ref>Blanchard(1841)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To those who, looking at the quantity of her published prose and poetry, might wonder how she found time for all these private and unproductive exercises of her pen, it may be desirable to explain, not merely that she wrote, but that she read, with remarkable rapidity. Books, indeed, of the highest character, she would dwell upon with \"amorous delay;\" but those of ordinary interest, or the nine-day wonders of literature, she would run through in a much shorter space of time than would seem consistent with that thorough understanding of their contents at which she always arrived, or with that accurate observation of the less striking features which she would generally prove to have been bestowed, by reference almost to the very page in which they might be noted. Of some work which she scarcely seemed to have glanced through, she would give an elaborate and succinct account, pointing out the gaps in the plot, or the discrepancies in the characters, and supporting her judgment by all but verbatim quotations.</blockquote>\n\nOther contemporaries also praised Landon's exceptionally high level of intelligence. Fredric Rowton, in ''The Female Poets of Great Britain'', put it thus:<ref>Rowton(1848)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Of Mrs Maclean's genius there can be but one opinion. It is distinguished by very great intellectual power, a highly sensitive and ardent imagination, an intense fervour of passionate emotion, and almost unequalled eloquence and fluency. Of mere art she displays but little. Her style is irregular and careless, and her painting sketchy and rough but there is genius in every line she has written.</blockquote>\n\n(Like many others, Rowton is deceived by the artistry of Landon's projection of herself as the improvisatrice, L. E. L. As [[Glennis Stevenson]] writes, few poets have been as artificial as Landon in her \"gushing stream of Song\". She cites the usage of repetition, mirroring and the embedding of texts amongst the techniques that account for the characteristic intensity of Landon's poetry.)\n\n== Reputation ==\nAmong the poets of her own time to recognise and admire Landon were [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], who wrote \"L.E.L.'s Last Question\" in homage; and [[Christina Rossetti]], who published a tribute poem entitled \"L.E.L\" in her 1866 volume ''The Prince's Progress and Other Poems''.\n\nLandon's reputation, while high in the 19th century, fell during most of the 20th as literary fashions changed: her poetry was perceived as overly simple and sentimental. In recent years, however, scholars and critics have increasingly studied her work, beginning with [[Germaine Greer]]<ref>Greer, Germaine. ''Slip-shod Sybils''</ref> in the 1970s. Critics such as [[Isobel Armstrong]] argue that the supposed simplicity of poetry such as Landon's is deceptive, and that women poets of the 19th century often employed a method of writing which allows for multiple, concurrent levels of meaning.<ref>Armstrong, Isobel. \"The Gush of the Feminine\".</ref> Such criticism had already been addressed by Sarah Sheppard in her \"Characteristics of the Genius and Writings of L E L\" of 1841.<ref>Letitia Elizabeth Landon at Corvey Writers on the Web</ref> Her opening paragraph runs:\n\n<blockquote>Because they whose decision it is, are subjects of the superficial spirit of the age, which leaves them unacquainted with all of which it appoints them judges. Because, either from a dislike of trouble, or inability to pursue the inquiry, these judges never deviate from their own beaten right line to observe how genius acts and is acted upon,\u2014how it is influenced, and what effects it produces on society. Hence the mistaken opinions concerning literary characters one is often compelled to hear from those who, it is to be feared, know little of what they affirm; and of literary works from those who, it is also to be feared, are not competent to decide on their merits. It is indeed strange with what decision people set their seal of condemnation on volumes beyond whose title-pages they have scarcely looked.</blockquote>\n\nHer ideas and the diversity of her poetry engendered a \"Landon School\", in England but also in America.<ref>Dibert-Himes</ref> As for style, William Howitt comments: \"This is one singular peculiarity of the poetry of L. E. L.; and her poetry must be confessed to be peculiar. It is entirely her own. It had one prominent and fixed character, and that character belonged solely to itself. The rhythm, the feeling, the style and phraseology of L. E. L.'s poetry, were such, that you could immediately recognize it, though the writer's name was not mentioned.\"<ref>Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840</ref>\n\nA tribute in ''The London Literary Gazette'', following Landon's death, ran:\n\n<blockquote>To express what we feel on her loss is impossible \u2013 and private sorrows of so deep a kind are not for public display: her name will descend to the most distant times, as one of the brightest in the annals of English literature; and whether after ages look at the glowing purity and nature of her first poems, or the more sustained thoughtfulness and vigour of her later works, in prose or in verse, they will cherish her memory as that of one of the most beloved of female authors, the pride and glory of our country while she lived, and the undying delight of succeeding generations. Then, as in our day, young hearts will beat responsive to the thrilling touch of her music; her song of love will find a sacred home in many a fair and ingenuous bosom; her numbers, which breathed of the finest humanities, her playfulness of spirit, and her wonderful delineation of character and society \u2013 all \u2013 all will be admired, but not lamented as now. She is gone; and, oh, what a light of mind is extinguished: what an amount of friendship and of love has gone down into the grave!</blockquote>\n\n== List of works ==\n[[File:\"The Love Letter\" painting by Henry James Richter.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Henry James Richter]], depicting a scene from [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), executed between 1816 and 1832. A handwritten poem, \"The Love Letter\", by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, is on a wooden slide at the bottom of the painting.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rmgGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58 The Gallery of Engravings Volume II by George Newenham Wright]</ref><ref>Ketter collection</ref>]]\nIn addition to the works listed below, Landon was responsible for numerous anonymous reviews, and other articles whose authorship is unlikely now to be established (compare Emma Roberts above). She also assumed the occasional pseudonym: for one, she adopted the name Iole for a period from 1825\u201327. Two of her Iole poems, \"The Wreck\" and \"The Frozen Ship\", were later included in the collection, ''The Vow of the Peacock''. On her death, she left a list of projected works. Besides \"Lady Anne Granard\" (first volume completed) and her \"tragedy\" (Castruccio Catrucani), there were: a critical work in 3 volumes to be called \"Female Portrait Gallery in Modern Literature\" for which she says she has collected a vast amount of material (only some portraits based on [[Walter Scott]] were produced); a romance called \"Charlotte Corday\" for which a plan was sketched plus a \"chapter or two\"; and a projected 2 volume work on \"travels in the country I am about to visit, including the history of the slave trade of which I shall [have] the opportunity of collecting so many curious facts\".<ref>Adriana Craciun</ref>\n\n* ''The Fate of Adelaide.
