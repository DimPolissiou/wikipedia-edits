It was created in 1977 through the spin-off of divisions of the Varta Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altana.com/company/history.html|title=History - ALTANA AG|first=ALTANA|last=AG|website=www.altana.com}}</ref> The first CEO was [[Herbert Quandt]].\n\nThe group comprises the divisions [[BYK Additives & Instruments|BYK]] (coating additives and instruments), Eckart (metal effect pigments and metallic printing inks), Elantas (insulation materials for the electrical and electronics industries) and Actega (coatings and sealant compounds for the packaging industry).\n\nThe Altana Group has 47 production facilities and 65 service and research laboratories worldwide. In 2019, the company, with about 6,500 employees, posted revenues of approximately \u20ac2.25 billion.<ref name=\"CR2019\" />\n\n== History ==\nAltana's roots go back to 1873, when Heinrich Byk founded the chemicals factory Dr. Heinrich Byk Chemische Fabrik in [[Oranienburg]].  The company grew, and in 1931 it was renamed BYK-Gulden Lomberg. In 1941 majority control of the company was acquired by AFA (Akkumulatoren-Fabrik AG) which was renamed [[VARTA]] in 1962.  In 1977 VARTA was split into three companies, one of which was Altana.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.altana.com/company/history.html|publisher=Altana AG|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1977 to 2010, Altana was publicly traded on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. Altana was also admitted to trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOn 19 December 2006 the majority of [[shareholder]]s voted to approve the sale of the pharmaceuticals division to the Danish company [[Nycomed]]. Nycomed is owned by an investment consortium led by [[Nordic Capital]] and [[Credit Suisse]]. With the sale of the pharmaceuticals division, headquartered in [[Konstanz]], [[Germany]], Altana lost a major pillar of its business. At that time, 9,000 of the company's 13,500 employees were working for Altana in the pharmaceuticals sector, generating two-thirds of the company's total revenue. And indeed, the balance-sheet revenues fell by around 60 percent in 2006, but gained over six percent in 2007.\n\nThe patent for pantaprazole, the main revenue-generator for the former pharmaceuticals division, expired in 2009/2010. While the Altana Management Board justified the divestiture of the pharmaceutical business with delays in the approval of new products, increased research and development costs as well as strict regulatory requirements in the [[US]] and [[Europe]], shareholder activists asserted that the Management Board had invested too little in the pharmaceutical business in the preceding years and had failed to develop successor products in time to compensate for the revenue losses to be expected due to the expiry of the pantaprazole patent at the end of the decade.\n\nThe pharmaceuticals division was sold for \u20ac4.6 billion. The entire proceeds from the sale were disbursed to the shareholders, who received a special dividend of \u20ac33 per share. Critics expressed discontent that the main shareholder benefited most from the sale of the pharmaceuticals division.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007, the company was organized into the pharmaceuticals division Altana Pharma AG, formerly Byk Gulden Lomberg Chemische Fabrik, headquartered in Konstanz, and the specialty chemicals division Altana Chemie AG based in [[Wesel]]. Since the sale of the pharmaceutical business to Nycomed, Altana has been operating exclusively in the specialty chemicals segment. This restructuring was accompanied by a change in the company logo, which was unified across all subsidiaries.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, main shareholder [[SKion GmbH]] (Germany, owned by [[Susanne Klatten]]) issued a public takeover offer of \u20ac13 per share for all outstanding shares, an action which drove up the stock price.

It was created in 1977 through the spin-off of divisions of the Varta Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altana.com/company/history.html|title=History - ALTANA AG|first=ALTANA|last=AG|website=www.altana.com}}</ref> The first CEO was [[Herbert Quandt]].\n\nThe group comprises the divisions [[BYK Additives & Instruments|BYK]] (coating additives and instruments), Eckart (metal effect pigments and metallic printing inks), Elantas (insulation materials for the electrical and electronics industries) and Actega (coatings and sealant compounds for the packaging industry).\n\nThe Altana Group has 52 production facilities and 60 service and research laboratories worldwide. In 2018, the company, with about 6,400 employees, posted revenues of approximately \u20ac2.3 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altana.com/press-news/press-news.html?no_cache=1&newsID=4956|title=About ALTANA - ALTANA AG|first=ALTANA|last=AG|website=www.altana.com}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAltana's roots go back to 1873, when Heinrich Byk founded the chemicals factory Dr. Heinrich Byk Chemische Fabrik in [[Oranienburg]].  The company grew, and in 1931 it was renamed BYK-Gulden Lomberg. In 1941 majority control of the company was acquired by AFA (Akkumulatoren-Fabrik AG) which was renamed [[VARTA]] in 1962.  In 1977 VARTA was split into three companies, one of which was Altana.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.altana.com/company/history.html|publisher=Altana AG|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1977 to 2010, Altana was publicly traded on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. Altana was also admitted to trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOn 19 December 2006 the majority of [[shareholder]]s voted to approve the sale of the pharmaceuticals division to the Danish company [[Nycomed]]. Nycomed is owned by an investment consortium led by [[Nordic Capital]] and [[Credit Suisse]]. With the sale of the pharmaceuticals division, headquartered in [[Konstanz]], [[Germany]], Altana lost a major pillar of its business. At that time, 9,000 of the company's 13,500 employees were working for Altana in the pharmaceuticals sector, generating two-thirds of the company's total revenue. And indeed, the balance-sheet revenues fell by around 60 percent in 2006, but gained over six percent in 2007.\n\nThe patent for pantaprazole, the main revenue-generator for the former pharmaceuticals division, expired in 2009/2010. While the Altana Management Board justified the divestiture of the pharmaceutical business with delays in the approval of new products, increased research and development costs as well as strict regulatory requirements in the [[US]] and [[Europe]], shareholder activists asserted that the Management Board had invested too little in the pharmaceutical business in the preceding years and had failed to develop successor products in time to compensate for the revenue losses to be expected due to the expiry of the pantaprazole patent at the end of the decade.\n\nThe pharmaceuticals division was sold for \u20ac4.6 billion. The entire proceeds from the sale were disbursed to the shareholders, who received a special dividend of \u20ac33 per share. Critics expressed discontent that the main shareholder benefited most from the sale of the pharmaceuticals division.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007, the company was organized into the pharmaceuticals division Altana Pharma AG, formerly Byk Gulden Lomberg Chemische Fabrik, headquartered in Konstanz, and the specialty chemicals division Altana Chemie AG based in [[Wesel]]. Since the sale of the pharmaceutical business to Nycomed, Altana has been operating exclusively in the specialty chemicals segment. This restructuring was accompanied by a change in the company logo, which was unified across all subsidiaries.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, main shareholder [[SKion GmbH]] (Germany, owned by [[Susanne Klatten]]) issued a public takeover offer of \u20ac13 per share for all outstanding shares, an action which drove up the stock price. A company spokesperson stated that the intention was to delist the company from public trading. To achieve this, SKion issued a second takeover offer of \u20ac14 per share to the remaining shareholders on 9 November 2009.\n\nOn 30 December 2008, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] announced that Altana would be removed from its [[MDAX]] index, as the increase in the share held by SKion had pushed the portion of stock held in free float to under ten percent. By June 2010, SKion held 95.04 percent of all shares.\n\nIn Germany, the stock was traded mainly on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart Exchanges and the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] platform; internationally, it was admitted to trading on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASD Group]], now FINRA, in the US.\n\nAfter SKion acquired the entire Altana stock through a squeeze-out, trading in this stock was suspended effective 27 August 2010.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.altana.de/ Website of Altana AG]\n* [http://www.altana.com/press-news/dates-events/report-on-the-business-year-2013.html Report on the Business Year 2013], Altana AG\n\n[[Category:Chemical companies of Germany]]\n[[Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Chemical companies established in 1977]]\n[[Category:German brands]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in West Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Drive2012", "label": "safe", "comment": "Change some Facts, Corporate Report 2019", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altana"}

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region]. Qule [south of Keriya] and Pishan [modern Pishan or Guma] were conquered and fully occupied by Yutian [Khotan]. Yuli [Fukang], Danhuan, Guhu [Dawan Cheng], and Wutanzili were destroyed by Jushi [Turpan and Jimasa]. Later these kingdoms were re-established.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the Yongping period [58 - 75 CE], the Northern Xiongnu forced several countries to help them plunder the commanderies and districts of Hexi.

Then he appointed the Qiuci (Kucha) Marquis of the Left, Douti, King of Shule (Kashgar).\n\nIn winter 73 CE, the Han sent the Major [[Ban Chao]] who captured and bound Douti. He appointed Zhong, the son of the elder brother of Cheng, to be king of Shule (Kashgar). Zhong later rebelled. (Ban) Chao attacked and beheaded him.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\n=== The Kushans ===\n[[File:Kashgar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kashgar's Sunday market.]]\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' also gives the only extant historical record of [[Yuezhi]] or [[Kushan]] involvement in the Kashgar oasis:\n\n{{bquote|During the Yuanchu period (114-120) in the reign of Emperor, the king of Shule (Kashgar), exiled his maternal uncle Chenpan to the Yuezhi (Kushans) for some offence. The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar). Thus Shule (Kashgar), became powerful and a rival to Qiuci (Kucha) and Yutian (Khotan).\"<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}\n}}\n\nHowever, it was not very long before the Chinese began to reassert their authority in the region:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yongjian year (127), during Emperor Shun\u2019s reign, Chenpan sent an envoy to respectfully present offerings. The Emperor bestowed on Chenpan the title of Great Commandant-in-Chief for the Han. Chenxun, who was the son of his elder brother, was appointed Temporary Major of the Kingdom.\n\nIn the fifth year (130), Chenpan sent his son to serve the Emperor and, along with envoys from Dayuan (Ferghana) and Suoju (Yarkand), brought tribute and offerings.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43}}}}\n\nFrom an earlier part of the same text comes the following addition:\n\n{{bquote|In the first Yangjia year (132), Xu You sent the king of Shule (Kashgar), Chenpan, who with 20,000 men, attacked and defeated Yutian (Khotan). He beheaded several hundred people, and released his soldiers to plunder freely. He replaced the king [of Jumi] by installing Chengguo from the family of [the previous king] Xing, and then he returned.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|15}}}}\n\nThen the first passage continues:\n\n{{bquote|In the second Yangjia year (133), Chenpan again made offerings (including) a lion and zebu cattle.\n\nThen, during Emperor Ling\u2019s reign, in the first Jianning year [168], the king of Shule (Kashgar) and Commandant-in-Chief for the Han (i.e. presumably Chenpan), was killed while hunting by the youngest of his paternal uncles, Hede. Hede named himself king.\n\nIn the third year (170), Meng Tuo, the Inspector of Liangzhou, sent the Provincial Officer Ren She, commanding five hundred soldiers from Dunhuang, with the Wuji Major Cao Kuan, and Chief Clerk of the Western Regions, Zhang Yan, brought troops from Yanqi ([[Karashahr]]), Qiuci (Kucha), and the Nearer and Further States of Jushi (Turpan and Jimasa), altogether numbering more than 30,000, to punish Shule (Kashgar). They attacked the town of Zhenzhong [Arach \u2212 near Maralbashi] but, having stayed for more than forty days without being able to subdue it, they withdrew. Following this, the kings of Shule (Kashgar) killed one another repeatedly while the Imperial Government was unable to prevent it.<ref name=\"Hill2009\"/>{{rp|43, 45}}}}\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to the Sui dynasty ===\nThese centuries are marked by a general silence in sources on Kashgar and the Tarim Basin.\n\nThe ''[[Weil\u00fce]]'', composed in the second third of the 3rd century, mentions a number of states as dependencies of Kashgar: the kingdom of Zhenzhong (Arach?), the kingdom of Suoju (Yarkand), the kingdom of Jieshi, the kingdom of Qusha, the kingdom of Xiye (Khargalik), the kingdom of Yinai (Tashkurghan), the kingdom of Manli (modern Karasul), the kingdom of Yire (Mazar \u2212 also known as T\u00e1gh N\u00e1k and Tokanak), the kingdom of Yuling, the kingdom of Juandu (\u2018Tax Control\u2019 \u2212 near modern Irkeshtam), the kingdom of Xiuxiu (\u2018Excellent Rest Stop\u2019 \u2212 near Karakavak), and the kingdom of Qin.\n\nHowever, much of the information on the Western Regions contained in the ''Weil\u00fce'' seems to have ended roughly about (170), near the end of Han power. So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

After his death, Kashgar came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khans]]. [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he calls ''Cascar'', about 1273-4 and recorded the presence of numerous [[Nestorian Christians]], who had their own churches. Later In the 14th century, a Chagataid khan [[Tughluq Timur]] converted to Islam, and Islamic tradition began to reassert its ascendancy.\n\n[[File:Kashgar road scene, 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Kashgar road scene, 1870s]]\n\nIn 1389\u22121390 [[Tamerlane]] ravaged Kashgar, [[Andijan]] and the intervening country. Kashgar endured a troubled time, and in 1514, on the invasion of the Khan [[Sultan Said Khan|Sultan Said]], was destroyed by [[Mirza Ababakar]], who with the aid of ten thousand men built a new fort with massive defences higher up on the banks of the [[Tuman river]]. The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of [[Yangishahr|Yangi Shahr]], [[Yangihissar|Yangi-Hissar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.\n\nWith the overthrow of Chinese rule in 1865 by Yakub Beg (1820\u20131877), the manufacturing industries of Kashgar are supposed to have declined.\n\nYaqub Beg entered into relations and signed treaties with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], but when he tried to get their support against China, he failed.\n\nKashgar and the other cities of the Tarim Basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until May 1877, when he died at [[Korla]]. Thereafter Kashgaria was reconquered by the forces of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] general [[Zuo Zongtang]] during the [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang]].\n\n===Qing rule===\n\nThere were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common, and \"laxity\" set upon Uyghur women led them to marry Chinese men in the period after Yakub Beg's rule ended. It is also believed by Uyghurs that some Uyghurs have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage, such as those living in [[Turpan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joanne N.

In the 2010 census, this number increased to 506,640.

Thousands of farmers from the surrounding fertile lands come into the city to sell a wide variety of fruit and vegetables. Kashgar's livestock market is also very lively. Silk and carpets made in Hotan are sold at bazaars, as well as local crafts, such as copper teapots and wooden jewellery boxes.\n\nIn order to boost the economy in Kashgar region, the government classified the area as the sixth [[Special Economic Zone of China]] in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100707/100546.shtml |title=Kashgar: Ancient city regains vitality |work=CCTV.com |date=2010-07-07 |access-date=2010-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226165801/http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100707/100546.shtml |archive-date=2010-12-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe movie ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'' was filmed in Kashgar.

The city was made into a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in 2010, the only city in western China with this distinction.

Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A.

By the time covered by the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (roughly 25 to 170 CE), it had grown to 21,000 households and had 3,000 men able to bear arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe ''Book of the Later Han'' provides a wealth of detail on developments in the region:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{bquote|In the period of Emperor Wu [140-87 BC], the Western Regions1 were under the control of the Interior [China]. They numbered thirty-six kingdoms. The Imperial Government established a Colonel [in charge of] Envoys there to direct and protect these countries. Emperor Xuan [73-49 BC] changed this title [in 59 BC] to Protector-General.\n\nEmperor Yuan [40-33 BC] installed two Wuji Colonels to take charge of the agricultural garrisons on the frontiers of the king of Nearer Jushi [Turpan].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the time of Emperor Ai [6 BCE - 1 CE] and Emperor Ping [1 - 5 CE], the principalities of the Western Regions split up and formed fifty-five kingdoms. Wang Mang, after he usurped the Throne [in 9 CE], demoted and changed their kings and marquises. Following this, the Western Regions became resentful, and rebelled. They, therefore, broke off all relations with the Interior [China] and, all together, submitted to the Xiongnu again.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Xiongnu collected oppressively heavy taxes and the kingdoms were not able to support their demands. In the middle of the Jianwu period [AD 25-56], they each [Shanshan and Yarkand in 38, and 18 kingdoms in 45], sent envoys to ask if they could submit to the Interior [China], and to express their desire for a Protector-General. Emperor Guangwu, decided that because the Empire was not yet settled [after a long period of civil war], he had no time for outside affairs, and [therefore] finally refused his consent [in 45 CE].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Xiongnu became weaker. The king of Suoju [Yarkand], named Xian, wiped out several kingdoms. After Xian\u2019s death [c. 62 CE], they began to attack and fight each other. Xiao Yuan [Tura], Jingjue [Cadota], Ronglu [Niya], and Qiemo [Cherchen] were annexed by Shanshan [the Lop Nur region]. Qule [south of Keriya] and Pishan [modern Pishan or Guma] were conquered and fully occupied by Yutian [Khotan].

The king of the Yuezhi became very fond of him. Later, Anguo died without leaving a son. His mother directed the government of the kingdom. She agreed with the people of the country to put Yifu (lit. \u201cposthumous child\u201d), who was the son of a full younger brother of Chenpan on the throne as king of Shule (Kashgar). Chenpan heard of this and appealed to the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan]]) king, saying:\n\n: \"Anguo had no son. His relative (Yifu) is weak. If one wants to put on the throne a member of (Anguo\u2019s) mother\u2019s family, I am Yifu\u2019s paternal uncle, it is I who should be king.\"\n\nThe Yuezhi (Kushans) then sent soldiers to escort him back to Shule (Kashgar). The people had previously respected and been fond of Chenpan. Besides, they dreaded the Yuezhi (Kushans). They immediately took the seal and ribbon from Yifu and went to Chenpan, and made him king. Yifu was given the title of Marquis of the town of Pangao [90 li, or 37 km, from Shule].\n\nThen Suoju (Yarkand) continued to resist Yutian (Khotan), and put themselves under Shule (Kashgar).

So, we cannot be sure that this is a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.\n\nChapter 30 of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' says that after the beginning of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220) the states of the Western Regions did not arrive as before, except for the larger ones such as [[Kucha]], [[Khotan]], [[Kangju]], [[Wusun]], Kashgar, [[Yuezhi]], [[Shanshan]] and [[Turpan]], who are said to have come to present tribute every year, as in Han times.\n\n[[File:Silk Road 1992.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Camels traversing the old [[silk road]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 270, four states from the Western Regions were said to have presented tribute: [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]], [[Shanshan]], and [[Kucha]]. Some wooden documents from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] seem to indicate that contacts were also maintained with Kashgar and Khotan around this time.\n\nIn 422, according to the ''Songshu'', ch. 98, the king of Shanshan, Bilong, came to the court and \"the thirty-six states in the Western Regions\" all swore their allegiance and presented tribute. It must be assumed that these 36 states included Kashgar.\n\nThe \"Songji\" of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]] records that in the 5th month of 435, nine states: Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all came to the Wei court.\n\nIn 439, according to the ''Weishu'', ch. 4A, Shanshan, Kashgar and Karashahr sent envoys to present tribute.\n\nAccording to the ''Weishu'', ch. 102, Chapter on the Western Regions, the kingdoms of Kucha, Kashgar, Wusun, Yueban, Tashkurghan, Shanshan, Karashahr, Turpan and Sute all began sending envoys to present tribute in the Taiyuan reign period (435-440).\n\nIn 453 Kashgar sent envoys to present tribute (''Weishu'', ch. 5), and again in 455.\n\nAn embassy sent during the reign of Wencheng Di (452-466) from the king of Kashgar presented a supposed sacred relic of the Buddha; a dress which was incombustible.\n\nIn 507 Kashgar, is said to have sent envoys in both the 9th and 10th months (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nIn 512, Kashgar sent envoys in the 1st and 5th months. (''Weishu'', ch. 8).\n\nEarly in the 6th century Kashgar is included among the many territories controlled by the Yeda or [[Hephthalite]] Huns, but their empire collapsed at the onslaught of the Western Turks between 563 and 567 who then probably gained control over Kashgar and most of the states in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n===Tang dynasty===\n{{Main|Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang campaign against the oasis states|l2=oasis states|Conquest of the Western Turks}}\n\nThe founding of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 saw the beginning of a prolonged struggle between China and the Western Turks for control of the Tarim Basin. In 635, the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tang Annals]]'' reported an emissary from the king of Kashgar to the Tang capital. In 639 there was a second emissary bringing products of Kashgar as a token of submission to the Tang state.\n\nBuddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]] passed through Kashgar (which he referred to as ''Ka-sha'') in 644 on his return journey from [[India]] to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to decay in India, was active in Kashgar. Xuanzang recorded that they flattened their babies heads, tattooed their bodies and had green eyes. He reported that Kashgar had abundant crops, fruits and flowers, wove fine woolen stuffs and rugs. Their writing system had been adapted from Indian script but their language was different from that of other countries. The inhabitants were sincere Buddhist adherents and there were some hundreds of monasteries with more than 10,000 followers, all members of the [[Sarvastivadin]] School.\n\nAt around the same era, [[Nestorian Christians]] were establishing bishoprics at [[Herat]], [[Merv]] and [[Samarkand]], whence they subsequently proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to [[China proper]] itself.\n\nIn 646, the Turkic Kagan asked for the hand of a Tang Chinese princess, and in return the Emperor promised Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, Karashahr and Sarikol as a marriage gift, but this did not happen as planned.\n\nIn a series of campaigns between 652 and 658, with the help of the Uyghurs, the Chinese finally [[Conquest of the Western Turks|defeated the Western Turk tribes]] and took control of all their domains, including the Tarim Basin kingdoms. [[Karakhoja]] was [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexed in 640]], [[Karashahr]] during campaigns [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|in 644]] and 648, and [[Tang campaign against Kucha|Kucha fell]] in 648.\n\nIn 662 a rebellion broke out in the Western Regions and a Chinese army sent to control it was defeated by the [[Tibet]]ans south of Kashgar.\n\nAfter another defeat of the Tang Chinese forces in 670, the Tibetans gained control of the whole region and completely subjugated Kashgar in 676-8 and retained possession of it until 692, when the Tang dynasty regained control of all their former territories, and retained it for the next fifty years.\n\nIn 722 Kashgar sent 4,000 troops to assist the Chinese to force the \"Tibetans out of \"Little Bolu\" or [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]].\n\nIn 728, the king of Kashgar was awarded a brevet by the Chinese emperor.\n\nIn 739, the ''Tangshu'' relates that the governor of the Chinese garrison in Kashgar, with the help of Ferghana, was interfering in the affairs of the [[Turgesh]] tribes as far as [[Taraz|Talas]].\n\n[[File:Kashgar-casco-viejo-d08.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Mosque entrance in old Kashgar]]\n\nIn 751 the Chinese were defeated by an Arab army in the [[Battle of Talas]]. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] led to the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia due to the fact that the Tang dynasty was forced to withdraw its troops from the region to fight An Lushan. The Tibetans cut all communication between China and the West in 766.\n\nSoon after the Chinese pilgrim monk Wukong passed through Kashgar in 753. He again reached Kashgar on his return trip from India in 786 and mentions a Chinese deputy governor as well as the local king.\n\n===Battles with Arab Caliphate===\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nIn 711, the Arabs invaded Kashgar.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PT798&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places  |editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |page=598 |publisher=Routledge|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-884964-04-6 }}</ref> It is alleged that [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 712-715 had conquered Xinjiang.<ref name=\"Dillon2014\">{{cite book|author=Michael Dillon|title=Xinjiang and the Expansion of Chinese Communist Power: Kashgar in the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2MtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-64721-8|pages=7\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Broomhall1910\">{{cite book|author=Marshall Broomhall|title=Islam in China: A Neglected Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1910|publisher=Morgan & Scott, Limited|pages=17\u2013}}</ref> Although the Muslim religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence.

After his death, Kashgar came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khans]]. [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he calls ''Cascar'', about 1273-4 and recorded the presence of numerous [[Nestorian Christians]], who had their own churches. Later In the 14th century, a Chagataid khan [[Tughluq Timur]] converted to Islam, and Islamic tradition began to reassert its ascendancy.\n\n[[File:Kashgar road scene, 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Kashgar road scene, 1870s]]\n\nIn 1389\u22121390 [[Tamerlane]] ravaged Kashgar, [[Andijan]] and the intervening country. Kashgar endured a troubled time, and in 1514, on the invasion of the Khan [[Sultan Said Khan|Sultan Said]], was destroyed by [[Mirza Ababakar]], who with the aid of ten thousand men built a new fort with massive defences higher up on the banks of the [[Tuman river]]. The dynasty of the Chagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 with the division of the country among rival factions; soon after, two powerful [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] factions, the White and Black Mountaineers ([[Ak Tagh]]liq or Afaqi, and [[Kara Taghliq]] or Ishaqi), arose whose differences and war-making gestures, with the intermittent episode of the [[Oirats]] of [[Dzungaria]], make up much of recorded history in Kashgar until 1759. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] conquered Kashgar and set up the Khoja as their puppet rulers.\n\n=== Qing conquest ===\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] defeated the Dzungar Khanate during the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] and took control of Kashgar in 1759. The conquerors consolidated their authority by settling other ethnics emigrants in the vicinity of a [[Manchu]] garrison.\n\nRumours flew around Central Asia that the Qing planned to launch expeditions towards [[Transoxiana]] and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sought assistance from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]]. The alleged expedition never happened so Ahmad Shah withdrew his forces from Kokand. He also dispatched an ambassador to [[Beijing]] to discuss the situation of the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Afaqi Khojas]], but the representative was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too busy fighting off the [[Sikhs]] to attempt to enforce his demands through arms.\n\nThe Qing continued to hold Kashgar with occasional interruptions during the [[Afaqi Khoja revolts]]. One of the most serious of these occurred in 1827, when the city was taken by [[Jahanghir Khoja]]; [[Chang-lung]], however, the Qing general of Ili, regained possession of Kashgar and the other rebellious cities in 1828. \n[[File:Kalmak archer.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Kalmyk Archer, Kashgar Army in the 1870s]]\n\nThe [[Kokand Khanate]] raided Kashgar several times. A revolt in 1829 under [[Mahommed Ali Khan]] and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir resulted in the concession of several important trade privileges to the Muslims of the district of [[Altishahr]] (the \"six cities\"), as it was then called.\n\nThe area enjoyed relative calm until 1846 under the rule of [[Zahir-ud-din]], the local Uyghur governor, but in that year a new [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] revolt under [[Kath Tora]] led to his accession as the authoritarian ruler of the city. However, his reign was brief{{mdash}}at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to [[Khanate of Kokand|Khokand]] amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja revolts (1857) was of about equal duration, and took place under [[Wali Khan (khoja)|Wali-Khan]], who murdered the well-known traveler [[Adolf Schlagintweit]].\n\n=== 1862 Chinese Hui revolt ===\nThe great [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]] involved insurrection among various Muslim ethnic groups. It broke out in 1862 in [[Gansu]] then spread rapidly to [[Dzungaria]] and through the line of towns in the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\n[[Dungan people|Dungan]] troops based in [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven thousand Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of [[Sadik Beg]], a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] chief, who was reinforced by [[Buzurg Khan]], the heir of [[Jahanghir Khoja]], and his general [[Yakub Beg]]. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik's request by the [[Alimqul|ruler of Khokand]] to raise what troops they could to aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.\n\n[[File:Night interview with King.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Night interview with Yakub Beg, King of Kashgaria, 1868]]\n\nSadik Beg soon repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of [[Yangishahr|Yangi Shahr]], [[Yangihissar|Yangi-Hissar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and other towns, and eventually became sole master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfit for the post of ruler.\n\nWith the overthrow of Chinese rule in 1865 by Yakub Beg (1820\u20131877), the manufacturing industries of Kashgar are supposed to have declined.\n\nYaqub Beg entered into relations and signed treaties with the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], but when he tried to get their support against China, he failed.\n\nKashgar and the other cities of the Tarim Basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until May 1877, when he died at [[Korla]].

Uyghur women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns.

In the 2010 census, this number increased to 506,640.

Thousands of farmers from the surrounding fertile lands come into the city to sell a wide variety of fruit and vegetables. Kashgar's livestock market is also very lively. Silk and carpets made in Hotan are sold at bazaars, as well as local crafts, such as copper teapots and wooden jewellery boxes.\n\nIn order to boost the economy in Kashgar region, the government classified the area as the sixth [[Special Economic Zone of China]] in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100707/100546.shtml |title=Kashgar: Ancient city regains vitality |work=CCTV.com |date=2010-07-07 |access-date=2010-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226165801/http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100707/100546.shtml |archive-date=2010-12-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe movie ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'' was filmed in Kashgar.
