It began in 1999 as a series of three-minute shorts and later ran for a season of full-length episodes spanning 21 minutes each. It chronicles the small-scale adventures and discoveries of a three-year-old puppet girl named Mona in her grandmother Nana Bea's backyard. The title is a contraction of the phrase \"Nana Land,\" referring to the setting.\n\nHopley and Shannon, who continued to work with Nickelodeon afterwards on their creation ''[[Mr. Meaty]]'', produced the series through their puppetry troupe [[The Grogs]] in association with [[Jack Lenz|Lenz Entertainment]]. The show uses a blend of hand puppetry and the manipulation of cardboard cutouts, particularly in the opening theme. While the shorts do not follow a structure, the half-hour episodes follow a loose format that includes at least one song and reading an original story to the viewers.\n\nThe show received three nominations at the 2004 [[Gemini Awards]] and was fairly well-received by Canadian and U.S. press, with some critics calling attention to the show's surreal presentation and genuine approach to its concept. It was short-lived, as Nickelodeon did not pick up a second season. In 2004, select episodes were released across several [[DVD]]s in the United States. In 2015, the series [[viral phenomenon|went viral]] with a resurgence in popularity on websites such as [[Tumblr]] and [[YouTube]] for its bizarre nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Tanya|title=Teens On Tumblr Are Obsessed With This Fucked Up Canadian Kids Show|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/nanalan-why|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bobkin|first1=Matt|title=Canadian kids\u2019 show Nanalan\u2019 goes viral, validates weirdness of Canadian millennials|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/television/canadian-kids-show-nanalan-goes-viral-validates-weirdness-of-canadian-millennials|website=National Post|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show focuses on Mona, a three-year-old girl with a big imagination and a tendency to repeat short words or phrases while also pronouncing them incorrectly. Each episode begins with Mona's mother dropping her daughter off at Nana's house and ends with her picking Mona up. Mona, Nana, and Nana's pet dog Russell spend the day exploring, learning, and visiting Nana's next-door neighbour Mr. Wooka.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mona ([[Jamie Shannon]]) is the main character. She is a humanoid three-year-old with green skin, a spherical head, wide bean-shaped eyes, and lime green hair tied into pigtails. In the original shorts, she cannot speak in full sentences and can only say a few words. She tends to mispronounce everything she says; for example, she says ''pea pod'' as \"peepo\" and ''mushroom'' as \"shoosh.\"\n*Nana ([[The Grogs|Jason Hopley]]) is Mona's grandmother, whom she stays with every weekday while her mother goes to work. She resembles a carrot, with bright orange skin and a very tall forehead. She wears a gaudy multicolored dress, big circular glasses, and a white wig. In the original shorts, her hair was dark red-orange.\n*Russell ([[Ali Eisner]]) is Nana's pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] dog who accompanies Mona when she visits. He does not talk and only barks or sniffs to communicate. Mona cannot pronounce his name correctly and always calls him \"Russer.\"\n*Mr. Wooka ([[Todd Doldersum]]) is Nana's next-door neighbor who is a main character in the full-length episodes. He is an elderly man with yellow skin and a white moustache who wears blue overalls. Whenever Mona visits his yard, he puts on his own puppet shows to entertain her.\n*Mrs. Bea (Marty Stelnick) is Mona's mother and Nana's daughter. She has a similar appearance to Mona but is taller and has brown hair in a bowl cut. She is a parent who works during the day and leaves Mona in Nana's care most of the time.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was filmed in a building \"reputed to be an old munitions factory\" in the television production district of [[Liberty Village]] in Toronto, Ontario.<ref name=globe>{{cite news|title=Puppeteers pull their own strings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/puppeteers-pull-their-own-strings/article1125279/|last=Kohler|first=Nicholas|date=January 8, 2004|accessdate=March 13, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=[[The Woodbridge Company]]}}</ref> The shorts were produced in 1999 and first aired on Nickelodeon's sister channel [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]]. They later appeared on Nickelodeon as part of the [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr. block]] and on Canada's [[CBC Television]], which eventually became a broadcaster of the full-length episodes. Reruns of the shorts continued to air until late 2003, when the first full-length season was produced.

It began in 1999 as a series of three-minute shorts and later ran for a season of full-length episodes spanning 21 minutes each. It chronicles the small-scale adventures and discoveries of a three-year-old puppet girl named Mona in her grandmother Nana Bea's backyard. The title is a contraction of the phrase \"Nana Land,\" referring to the setting.\n\nHopley and Shannon, who continued to work with Nickelodeon afterwards on their creation ''[[Mr. Meaty]]'', produced the series through their puppetry troupe [[The Grogs]] in association with [[Jack Lenz|Lenz Entertainment]]. The show uses a blend of hand puppetry and the manipulation of cardboard cutouts, particularly in the opening theme. While the shorts do not follow a structure, the half-hour episodes follow a loose format that includes at least one song and reading an original story to the viewers.\n\nThe show received three nominations at the 2004 [[Gemini Awards]] and was fairly well-received by Canadian and U.S. press, with some critics calling attention to the show's surreal presentation and genuine approach to its concept. It was short-lived, as Nickelodeon did not pick up a second season. In 2004, select episodes were released across several [[DVD]]s in the United States. In 2015, the series [[viral phenomenon|went viral]] with a resurgence in popularity on websites such as [[Tumblr]] and [[YouTube]] for its bizarre nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Tanya|title=Teens On Tumblr Are Obsessed With This Fucked Up Canadian Kids Show|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/nanalan-why|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bobkin|first1=Matt|title=Canadian kids\u2019 show Nanalan\u2019 goes viral, validates weirdness of Canadian millennials|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/television/canadian-kids-show-nanalan-goes-viral-validates-weirdness-of-canadian-millennials|website=National Post|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show focuses on Mona, a three-year-old girl with a big imagination and a tendency to repeat short words or phrases while also pronouncing them incorrectly. Each episode begins with Mona's mother dropping her daughter off at Nana's house and ends with her picking Mona up. Mona, Nana, and Nana's pet dog Russell spend the day exploring, learning, and visiting Nana's next-door neighbour Mr. Wooka.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mona ([[Jamie Shannon]]) is the main character. She is a humanoid three-year-old with green skin, a spherical head, wide bean-shaped eyes, and lime green hair tied into pigtails. In the original shorts, she cannot speak in full sentences and can only say a few words. She tends to mispronounce everything she says; for example, she says ''pea pod'' as \"peepo\" and ''mushroom'' as \"shoosh.\"\n*Nana ([[The Grogs|Jason Hopley]]) is Mona's grandmother, whom she stays with every weekday while her mother goes to work. She resembles a carrot, with bright orange skin and a very tall forehead. She wears a gaudy multicolored dress, big circular glasses, and a white wig. In the original shorts, her hair was dark red-orange.\n*Russell ([[Ali Eisner]]) is Nana's pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] dog who accompanies Mona when she visits. He does not talk and only barks or sniffs to communicate. Mona cannot pronounce his name correctly and always calls him \"Russer.\"\n*Mr. Wooka ([[Todd Doldersum]]) is Nana's next-door neighbor who is a main character in the full-length episodes. He is an elderly man with yellow skin and a white moustache who wears blue overalls. Whenever Mona visits his yard, he puts on his own puppet shows to entertain her.\n*Mrs. Bea (Marty Stelnick) is Mona's mother and Nana's daughter. She has a similar appearance to Mona but is taller and has brown hair in a bowl cut. She is a parent who works during the day and leaves Mona in Nana's care most of the time.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was filmed in a building \"reputed to be an old munitions factory\" in the television production district of [[Liberty Village]] in Toronto, Ontario.<ref name=globe>{{cite news|title=Puppeteers pull their own strings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/puppeteers-pull-their-own-strings/article1125279/|last=Kohler|first=Nicholas|date=January 8, 2004|accessdate=March 13, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=[[The Woodbridge Company]]}}</ref> The shorts were produced in 1999 and first aired on Nickelodeon's sister channel [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]].

The [[Danevirke]] between Hollingstedt and the [[Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay|Eckernf\u00f6rde bay]] was a Danish border wall towards Germany. [[Schleswig]] ([[Southern Jutland]]) was in the Viking Age still a direct part of the Kingdom of Denmark. First in the 13th century it became a fiefdom of Denmark. Old Danish were spoken north of a line between the Eider, Treene and Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay. But in the 17th, 18th and up to the 19th centuries there was a [[language shift]] from Danish and North Frisian dialects to Low German and later to High German as common speech in Southern Schleswig. Many German-minded Schleswigians have therefore ethnic Danish roots. At the same time there grew a conflict between German and Danish National Liberals, that culminated in two German-Danish wars in the 19th century.

On the other hand, many German-minded inhabitants had and have ethnic Danish ancestors and typical Nordic surnames. The Danish political party got almost 99,500 votes in 1947.\n\nHowever, the Danish government and the [[British Occupation Zone]] governors both opposed Southern Schleswig rejoining the Kingdom, and a referendum was never held in Southern Schleswig. Controversy over the issue divided two of the main Danish parties, and both ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' leader and Prime Minister [[Knud Kristensen]] and [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] leader [[John Christmas M\u00f8ller]] ultimately broke with their respective parties over the issue. In 1953 the so-called ''Programm Nord'' (''Northern Programme'') was set up by the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state government to help the area economically. This caused the Danish minority to decline until the 1970s. Since then, the minority has slowly been gaining size. Today it numbers around 50,000, although only a number of between 8,000 and 10,000 are assumed to speak Danish in everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sprachenatelier-berlin.de/de/topic/521.daenischkurse-in-berlin.html|title=D\u00e4nischkurse - D\u00e4nisch lernen in Berlin|author=Sprachenatelier Berlin|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Between 10,000 and 20,000 of them have Danish as their mother tongue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.uit.no/a/svenonius/lingua/flow/li/about/daom_da.html |title=Om dansk |accessdate=29 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174404/http://www.hum.uit.no/a/svenonius/lingua/flow/li/about/daom_da.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dankultur.de/daenemark-info/sprache.htm|title=dankultur.de|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe fluctuation of the Danish minority is reflected also in the respective literature that describes the local phenomenon of changing national self-identification with the term \"New Danes\".

The Danish political party got almost 99,500 votes in 1947.\n\nHowever, the Danish government and the [[British Occupation Zone]] governors both opposed Southern Schleswig rejoining the Kingdom, and a referendum was never held in Southern Schleswig. Controversy over the issue divided two of the main Danish parties, and both ''[[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]]'' leader and Prime Minister [[Knud Kristensen]] and [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] leader [[John Christmas M\u00f8ller]] ultimately broke with their respective parties over the issue. In 1953 the so-called ''Programm Nord'' (''Northern Programme'') was set up by the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state government to help the area economically. This caused the Danish minority to decline until the 1970s. Since then, the minority has slowly been gaining size. Today it numbers around 50,000, although only a number of between 8,000 and 10,000 are assumed to speak Danish in everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sprachenatelier-berlin.de/de/topic/521.daenischkurse-in-berlin.html|title=D\u00e4nischkurse - D\u00e4nisch lernen in Berlin|author=Sprachenatelier Berlin|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Between 10,000 and 20,000 of them have Danish as their mother tongue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.uit.no/a/svenonius/lingua/flow/li/about/daom_da.html |title=Om dansk |accessdate=29 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174404/http://www.hum.uit.no/a/svenonius/lingua/flow/li/about/daom_da.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dankultur.de/daenemark-info/sprache.htm|title=dankultur.de|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe fluctuation of the Danish minority is reflected also in the respective literature that describes the local phenomenon of changing national self-identification with the terminus \"New Danes\". The number of Danes vary e.g. in \"Fischers Weltalmanach\" (World Almanac), having been specified with 30,000 until 1994, then having risen up to 60,000 in 1995 and finally having been reduced to 50,000 since the year 2001.

The numbers of members and also of users of the minority's organisations (sport clubs, culture associations, playschools, schools, libraries, etc.) and likewise the number of electors of the Danish party are considered to indicate people being Danish, although it has to be mentioned that the data records of the organisations are not linked among themselves and - what is more - the majority of users and members do not have Danish as their mother tongue.\n\nThe Danish minority is represented by the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] (SSW) in the [[Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein|Diet (Landtag) of Schleswig-Holstein]]. The SSW is not subject to the general requirement of passing a 5% vote threshold in order to receive proportional seats in the state parliament. In the most recent 2012 election, the SSW received 4.6% of the vote and three seats.<ref name=\"StatAmt\">{{cite web|url=http://landtagswahl-sh.de/wahlen.php?site=left/gebiete&wahl=23#index.php?site=right/ergebnis&wahl=23&anzeige=4&gebiet=1&idx=0&typ=1&stimme=2&hoch=0&partei=&untertyp=0&flip=1&sitz=0&sitzHoch=0&mode=liste |title=Landtagswahl in Schleswig-Holstein am 6.
