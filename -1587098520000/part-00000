The island is particularly notable as the habitat of the [[Komodo dragon]], the largest lizard on Earth, which is named after the island. Komodo Island has a surface area of 390 square kilometres and a human population of over two thousand. The people of the island are descendants of former [[convict|convicts]] who were exiled to the island and who have mixed with [[Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]]. The people are primarily adherents of [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] but there are also [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]] and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] congregations.\n\nKomodo is part of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda chain]] of islands and forms part of the [[Komodo National Park]]. In addition, the island is a popular destination for [[Scuba diving|diving]]. Administratively, it is part of the [[East Nusa Tenggara]] [[Provinces of Indonesia|Province]].\n\n==Description==\nKomodo is part of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda chain]] of islands and forms part of the [[Komodo National Park]]. It lies between the substantially larger neighboring islands [[Sumbawa]] to the west and [[Flores]] to the east. The island's surface area covers 390 square kilometres.  Komodo Island is home to the Komodo Dragon, the largest lizard on earth.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest stories (among Westerners) of a dragon-like animal existing in the region circulated widely and attracted considerable attention.  But no Westerner visited the island to check the story until official interest was sparked in the early 1910s by stories from [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors based in [[Flores]] in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] about a mysterious creature. The creature was allegedly a dragon which inhabited a small island in the Lesser Sunda Islands (the main island of which is Flores).\n[[Image:Vegetation on Komodo Island.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetation on Komodo Island]]\n\nThe Dutch sailors reported that the creature measured up to seven metres (twenty-three feet) in length with a large body and mouth which constantly breathed fire. It burnt them and so they could not continue the investigation. It was believed then that the odd creature could fly. Hearing the reports, Lieutenant Steyn van Hensbroek, an official of the Dutch Colonial Administration in Flores, planned a trip to Komodo Island to continue the search himself. He armed himself, and accompanied by a team of soldiers, he landed on the island. After a few days, Hensbroek managed to kill one of the lizards to investigate.\n\nVan Hensbroek took the dragon to headquarters where measurements were taken. It was approximately 2.1 metres (6.9 feet) long, with a shape very similar to that of a [[lizard]]. More samples were then photographed by Peter A. Ouwens, the Director of the Zoological Museum and [[Bogor Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]] in [[Bogor]], [[Java]]. The records that Ouwens made are the first reliable documentation of details about what is now called the Komodo dragon (or Komodo monitor).\n\nOuwens was keen to obtain additional samples. He recruited hunters who killed two dragons measuring 3.1 metres and 3.35 metres as well as capturing two pups, each measuring less than one metre. Ouwens carried out studies on the samples and concluded that the Komodo dragon was not a flame-thrower but was a type of [[monitor lizard]]. Research results were published in 1912. Ouwens named the giant lizard ''Varanus komodoensis''. Realizing the significance of the dragons on Komodo Island as an endangered species, the Dutch government issued a regulation on the protection of the lizards on Komodo Island in 1915.\n\nThe Komodo dragon became something of a living legend. In the decades since the Komodo was discovered, various scientific expeditions from a range of countries have carried out field research on the dragons on Komodo Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indonesiaindonesia.com/f/37477-sejarah-pulau-komodo/|title=Sejarah Pulau Komodo|work=indonesiaindonesia.com}}</ref>\n\n==Modern day==\nKomodo has a human population of over two thousand, spread out over the island and in the main [[Komodo (village)|Komodo village]].

By 1887 the preparatory technical school that would become [[Baku Polytechnicum]] was established in Baku. By 1910 it had integrated a curriculum related to the growing oil industry. However, the ratio of [[Azeri]]s to non-Azeris was so skewed that, of the 494 students studying at the school in 1916, only 20 were Azeri. On November 14, 1920, after the invasion of the [[Red Army]] and the establishment of the fledgling [[Azerbaijan SSR]], the new government decreed that Baku Polytechnicum would close and be replaced by Baku Polytechnical Institute, a more traditional [[Institute of technology|polytechnic institute]] and the beginnings of the current incarnation. The new school focused on training engineers in a broad range of industries, from agriculture to oil. By 1923 the school graduated its first three students; by 1927 it had risen to 289 graduates.\n\nThe new school went through many name changes over the years as its emphasis changed to meet the needs of Azerbaijan. In 1923 the school changed its name to Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute. In 1929 the agriculture department was spun off into a separate Agriculture Institute and the university changed its name to the Azerbaijan Oil Institute (AOI) in 1930. However, the expanding need for engineers in areas outside oil resulted in expansion in the school's curriculum. The school changed names again in 1934, this time to the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (Az.I.I.).\n\n[[World War II]] taxed the Soviet Union and schools like Az.I.I. struggled to stay open. At the end of the war, there was great demand for oil engineers in the Soviet Union and the school trained them in great numbers. In 1952, the government founded a separate Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute and moved much of the non-petrochemical curricula to the new school so that Az.I.I. could focus on the oil industry. On February 12, 1959 the school was renamed the Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute (AzOCI). In the early 1960s an evening program was developed. This program developed into its own, separate public university in 1992, reusing the name Azerbaijan Industrial Institute and becoming [[Sumgait State University]]. On March 21, 1992, after the independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union, the university changed its name to the current ASOIU.\n\nIn 1993 the school changed its curricula into a more Western model, with its first [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]] candidates graduating in 1999.\n\nBy the decree of the president, the university was named the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial University in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/16054|title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si - S\u018fN\u018fDL\u018fR \u00bb S\u0259r\u0259ncamlar|website=president.az|language=az|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asoiu.edu.az/en/page/1-about-asoiu|title=About ASOIU|website=www.asoiu.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Shooting spree ===\n{{Main | Azerbaijan State Oil Academy shootings }}\n\nOn April 30, 2009, [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy shootings|a shooting spree]] occurred at the academy in which thirteen people were killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8026194.stm Gun attack at Azerbaijan academy], BBC News, April 30, 2009</ref> The perpetrator was [[Farda Gadirov]], a Georgian citizen of Azerbaijani descent.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe campus is on Azadl\u0131q Prospekti (Liberty Avenue) in Baku.\n\n== Organization and administration ==\nThe university is run by a management body of [[prorector]]s, supervised by the Scientific Council and the rector [[Mustafa Babanli]].\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe Academy has eight faculties \u2013 Geology and Exploration Faculty, Gas, Petroleum and Mining Faculty, Chemical Technologies Faculty, Petro-mechanics Faculty, Energetics Faculty, Automatization of Production Processes Faculty, Engineering Economics, International Economic Relationships and Management Faculty and the Institute for Specialization and Re-education of Workforce for Industrial Organizations.\n\nSince the breakup of the Soviet Union, ASOA has worked with a dozen Western universities to Westernize and modernize its programs, in particular with [[Georgia State University]] to develop a modern [[Master of Business Administration]] program.<ref>Gary McKillips, \"[http://www.robinson.gsu.edu/magazine/fall2001/baku.html Teach a Man to Fish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901151104/http://www.robinson.gsu.edu/magazine/fall2001/baku.html |date=September 1, 2006 }}\", ''The State of Business'' (Georgia State University), Fall 2001, accessed on April 14, 2006</ref>\n\nASOA trains students in more than 50 fields: geological engineering, computer sciences, metallurgical engineering, hydrogeology engineering, geophysics engineering, mountain-mining engineering, petroleum and gas constructions engineering, heating energetics engineering, equipment production engineering, technology machinery and apparatus engineering, electrical engineering, electronics, communication and radiotechnics engineering, mechatronics and robotechnology engineering, mechanical engineering, information technology and systems engineering, re-manufacturing and repair engineering, metrology, standardization and certification engineering, chemical engineering, petroleum and gas engineering, automatization engineering, management, engineering economics, marketing and so on.\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1931, the university received \u201cOrder of the Red Banner of Labor of the Azerbaijan SSR\u201d and in 1940, it received \u201cOrder of the Red Banner of Labor\u201d.<ref>Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1926-1990). {{ISBN|978-5-85270-324-8}}, {{ISBNT|978-5-85270-292-0}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe Academy has its own sports complex with swimming pool, tennis courts and all-weather football pitch.

StarMetro operates both fixed-route and dial-a-ride service in the Tallahassee metropolitan area.\n\n== History ==\nFixed-Route Service began when the City of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] purchased the public transit system from Cities Transit Company and renamed it \u201cTaltran.\u201d In 1984, the city began offering Dial-A-Ride service. Construction of C.K. Steele Plaza ended in 1986. TalTran changed its name to StarMetro in 2005 during a \"Renaissance\", which included new buses and improved stops. StarMetro received federal grants in both 2011 and 2017 to purchase battery-electric buses.\n\n==Routes==\nStarMetro operates every day of the year except for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] Day. Weekday service consists of 15 regularly scheduled fixed-routes, two flex-routes, and one express route that operates during peak travel times. The \"Saturday\" schedule consists of 12 of the weekday routes, typically with the earliest trip eliminated and/or the headway reduced. The \"Sunday\" schedule consists of a completely separate system of four routes that is not as extensive as the weekday/Saturday routes. This Sunday route system is also run on weekday and Saturday nights (7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.). All weekday and Saturday routes are named for Tallahassee area locations and symbols while the Sunday routes are numbered. Additionally, Monday-Friday from 11:30 A. M. to 2:50 P. M. (last stop) & on Friday and Saturday evenings from 4:30 P. M. to 1:00 A. M. (last stop), StarMetro operates The \"Lunch/Dinner Trolley\" route, which offers free service to various entertainment locations in the Gaines Street (College Town), Downtown, Cascades Park and Midtown areas, serving each stop approximately every 20 minutes (\"Lunch Trolley\") & 30 minutes (\"Dinner Trolley\"). During \"[[Celebrate America]]\" on [[July 4th]] (Unofficially Route J4), StarMetro offers a special opportunity to view The Annual Fireworks at Tom Brown Park. So Park your car and enjoy a free bus ride to the event! Busses leave from The New Koger Center on Capital Cir. SE starting at 5:00 P. M., and continue operating approximately every 15 minutes until the last shuttle @ 8:30 P. M.  After the Fireworks have concluded, or 10:00 P. M., return service will commence with the last shuttle leaving Tom Brown Park @ 11:00 P. M.  [[Starting March 19, 2020, due to COVID-19]], [[all weekday bus service will end @ 8 P. M., Normal operating hours on Saturday & Sunday, Park Route, Night & Trolley service, will be temporarily suspended (starting March 30th), bus capacity will be limited to 15 passengers, until further notice.]]\n\n===Weekday Routes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

StarMetro has been providing campus transportation to FSU since 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The FSU Nite Nole route operates Monday through Saturday nights. These routes are free to the public and connect campus with nearby student housing facilities. In Fall 2019, FSU signed a 10 year contract with StarMetro to continue providing campus bus services. As part of the new contract, StarMetro began purchasing all electric buses to run exclusively on FSU campus routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.fsu.edu/news/2019/02/14/fsu-electric-buses/|title=Florida State becoming a driving force in electric-vehicle technology|date=2019-02-14|website=Florida State University News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> Each [[Proterra, Inc.|Proterra]] Catalyst FC bus costs approximately $719,000 with a battery lease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/transparency/budget-fy19.aspx|title=FY19 Approved Budget|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Tallahassee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The first campus route to go fully electric was the Heritage Route. Beginning in 2020, campus bus routes and times have been altered in order to prepare for the full roll out of electric buses across all routes. FSU is installing two overhead charging stations at their [[Doak Campbell Stadium]] bus stop and at Stadium Drive and Spirit Way. Currently, the university pays StarMetro a fee of $91.45/bus/hour to operate campus routes.\n\nStarMetro used to also provide fixed routes on the [[Florida A&M University]] campus, but this was discontinued when the institution decided not to renew its contract with the agency and began providing campus shuttle services in-house <ref>https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2016/06/30/famu-inks-starmetro-deal/86561198/</ref>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+FSU Campus Routes <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n!Route Abbreviation\n!Route Name\n!Destinations\n!Fall & Spring Term Operation Times\n|-\n|GA\n|Garnet\n|Ocala St (Northbound), High Road (Southbound), Ocala Corners Shopping, W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Eastbound), Jefferson Street (Westbound)\n|7:00am-7:51pm\nMon.-Fri.\n|-\n|GO\n|Gold\n|Ocala St (Southbound), High Road (Northbound), W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Westbound), Jefferson Street (Eastbound)\n|7:10am-7:57pm\n\nMon-Fri\n|-\n|HE\n|Heritage\n|C.K.

Steele Plaza ===\nStarMetro's main station is C.K. Steele Plaza (\"the plaza), which was named for the Reverend [[Charles Kenzie Steele]]. It is located at 111 West Tennessee Street in downtown Tallahassee on the block bordered by Tennessee Street, Adams Street, Call Street, and Duval Street. The plaza features 24 covered gates for passenger boarding and alighting. Amenities at the plaza include restrooms, covered seating areas, bus driver lounge, and a customer service booth. Fourteen out of the 15 regularly scheduled weekday routes (Azalea, Big Bend, Dogwood, Evergreen, Forest, Gulf, Hartsfield, Killearn, Moss, Park, Red Hills, San Luis, Tall Timbers and Southwood Express) stop at the plaza, in addition to The Heritage Route serving Florida State University Campus, making it the single busiest stop in the system. In addition to StarMetro busses, Steele Plaza serves as the eastern terminus of the Gadsden Express route, which connects the residents of [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] and [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] to Tallahassee.  The new [[Havana]] [[Express bus service|Express]] connects with Big Bend & Forest Routes at Lake Jackson.\n\nPlans to renovate the plaza and turn it into a mixed-use facility to include bus bays, StarMetro office space, and even leasable office space have been proposed. However, funding has not yet been procured.\n\n=== Headquarters ===\nThe headquarters for StarMetro are located at 555 Appleyard Drive at the corner of Appleyard and Jackson Bluff Road. Only two routes pass this facility (Forest and Live Oak). Located on this property are administrative offices, a bus maintenance facility, bus parking lot, call center, and customer service window. StarMetro is planning to relocate their bus storage and maintenance facility to a larger plot of land to accommodate for their growing fleet.\n\n=== Bus Stops ===\nBus stops are referred to as Star Stops, and they are denoted by a rectangular blue sign featuring a white star, route in appropriate color that serves particular location & days of operation. Stops served exclusively by FSU Campus Routes have a different sign with the Seminole Express logo and FSU colors. Many stops have no amenities, while the busier stops and transfer points have various amenities including benches, waste containers, and/or covered shelters.\n\n=== Super-Stops ===\nStarMetro plans to construct a series of \"Super Stops\" that will serve as transfer points in places where three or more routes currently or potentially intersect. These stops will be on a smaller scale of C.K. Steele Plaza and will feature covered walkways, benches, restrooms, and vending machines. StarMetro has plans to build three Super Stops on South Adams Street, North Monroe Street, and Hartsfield Road (near Mission Road). Each Super Stop is estimated to cost $3 million to construct. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Portals/0/admin/Sales%20Tax%20Committee/Projects/2013/Project%2029%20StarMetro%20-%20Enhanced%20Infrastructure.pdf|title=StarMetro Proposed Infrastructure Sales Tax Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA temporary park, costing $300,000 is being constructed at the future South Side Super Stop on the corner of Orange and Meridian Roads.

One planned change is the addition of two new transfer stops. These stops will make it possible to travel across Tallahassee without changing buses at the downtown hub station. In addition, StarMetro is planning [[Wireless LAN|wireless internet]] and television in buses, GPS-enabled buses with live location maps over the [[Internet]], solar-lighted stops with live location maps, and blinking lights at stops to let drivers know of waiting passengers. The C.K. Steele station includes renovation and installation of information [[Kiosk|kiosks]]. Seats on the newer-model buses are made of padded plastic and are arranged front-facing in rows and sideways against the walls, much like a [[Rapid transit|subway]] car layout. All models in use except the [[Dial-A-Ride]] shuttle vans exceed 4000 pounds, and therefore are not equipped with [[Seat belt|seat belts]]. All buses are equipped with climate-control and interior lighting.\n\nStarMetro implemented a complete route overhaul dubbed \"Nova2010\" in 2010, which reduced the current system to 11 routes, of which only 4 are intended meet at CK Steele Plaza. The routes now run at closer intervals than before, while providing transfer points all over the city \u2014 no longer requiring all two-bus trips to transfer at CK Steele Plaza. Some trips may now require two transfers, but will still generally result in a more direct and faster trip than transferring at the Plaza.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Tallahassee, Florida]]\n[[Category:Bus transportation in Florida]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Leon County, Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox bus company\n| name            = \n| logo            = StarMetro Logo.png\n| logo_size       = 250\n| image_size      = \n| image_caption   = \n| company_slogan  = Smart City.

StarMetro operates both fixed-route and dial-a-ride service in the Tallahassee metropolitan area.\n\n== History ==\nFixed-Route Service began when the City of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] purchased the public transit system from Cities Transit Company and renamed it \u201cTaltran.\u201d In 1984, the city began offering Dial-A-Ride service. Construction of C.K. Steele Plaza ended in 1986. TalTran changed its name to StarMetro in 2005 during a \"Renaissance\", which included new buses and improved stops. StarMetro received federal grants in both 2011 and 2017 to purchase battery-electric buses.\n\n==Routes==\nStarMetro operates every day of the year except for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] Day. Weekday service consists of 15 regularly scheduled fixed-routes, two flex-routes, and one express route that operates during peak travel times. The \"Saturday\" schedule consists of 12 of the weekday routes, typically with the earliest trip eliminated and/or the headway reduced. The \"Sunday\" schedule consists of a completely separate system of four routes that is not as extensive as the weekday/Saturday routes. This Sunday route system is also run on weekday and Saturday nights (7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.). All weekday and Saturday routes are named for Tallahassee area locations and symbols while the Sunday routes are numbered. Additionally, Monday-Friday from 11:30 A. M. to 2:50 P. M. (last stop) & on Friday and Saturday evenings from 4:30 P. M. to 1:00 A. M. (last stop), StarMetro operates The \"Lunch/Dinner Trolley\" route, which offers free service to various entertainment locations in the Gaines Street (College Town), Downtown, Cascades Park and Midtown areas, serving each stop approximately every 20 minutes (\"Lunch Trolley\") & 30 minutes (\"Dinner Trolley\"). During \"[[Celebrate America]]\" on [[July 4th]] (Unofficially Route J4), StarMetro offers a special opportunity to view The Annual Fireworks at Tom Brown Park. So Park your car and enjoy a free bus ride to the event! Busses leave from The New Koger Center on Capital Cir. SE starting at 5:00 P. M., and continue operating approximately every 15 minutes until the last shuttle @ 8:30 P. M.  After the Fireworks have concluded, or 10:00 P. M., return service will commence with the last shuttle leaving Tom Brown Park @ 11:00 P. M.  [[Starting March 19, 2020, due to COVID-19]], [[all weekday bus service will end @ 8 P. M., Normal operating hours on Saturday & Sunday, Park Route, Night & Trolley service, will be temporarily suspended, bus capacity will be limited to 15 passengers, until further notice.]]\n\n===Weekday Routes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

StarMetro has been providing campus transportation to FSU since 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The FSU Nite Nole route operates Monday through Saturday nights. These routes are free to the public and connect campus with nearby student housing facilities. In Fall 2019, FSU signed a 10 year contract with StarMetro to continue providing campus bus services. As part of the new contract, StarMetro began purchasing all electric buses to run exclusively on FSU campus routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.fsu.edu/news/2019/02/14/fsu-electric-buses/|title=Florida State becoming a driving force in electric-vehicle technology|date=2019-02-14|website=Florida State University News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> Each [[Proterra, Inc.|Proterra]] Catalyst FC bus costs approximately $719,000 with a battery lease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/transparency/budget-fy19.aspx|title=FY19 Approved Budget|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Tallahassee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The first campus route to go fully electric was the Heritage Route. Beginning in 2020, campus bus routes and times have been altered in order to prepare for the full roll out of electric buses across all routes. FSU is installing two overhead charging stations at their [[Doak Campbell Stadium]] bus stop and at Stadium Drive and Spirit Way. Currently, the university pays StarMetro a fee of $91.45/bus/hour to operate campus routes.\n\nStarMetro used to also provide fixed routes on the [[Florida A&M University]] campus, but this was discontinued when the institution decided not to renew its contract with the agency and began providing campus shuttle services in-house <ref>https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2016/06/30/famu-inks-starmetro-deal/86561198/</ref>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+FSU Campus Routes <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n!Route Abbreviation\n!Route Name\n!Destinations\n!Fall & Spring Term Operation Times\n|-\n|GA\n|Garnet\n|Ocala St (Northbound), High Road (Southbound), Ocala Corners Shopping, W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Eastbound), Jefferson Street (Westbound)\n|7:00am-7:51pm\nMon.-Fri.\n|-\n|GO\n|Gold\n|Ocala St (Southbound), High Road (Northbound), W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Westbound), Jefferson Street (Eastbound)\n|7:10am-7:57pm\n\nMon-Fri\n|-\n|HE\n|Heritage\n|C.K.

Children under 12 ride for free.\n*'''Bus charters''' are available with StarMetro.\n*'''Community Transportation Coordinator.''' Transportation services for citizens throughout Leon County are available. Riders must qualify through [[Medicaid]], Developmental Disabilities or the Transportation Disadvantaged program for transportation. This is door-to-door service with fares charged based on the sponsoring program.\n*'''Digital Bus Pass''' allows riders to purchase and use bus passes using the Token Transit App.\n\n==Fares==\nThe regular, one-trip fare is $1.25 and the reduced one-trip fare is $0.60. The reduced fare is available for seniors, children, disabled persons and people on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Passengers who purchase a one-trip fare may request a transfer ticket from the driver, which are free; those are valid for up to two transfers within 90 minutes of the ticket being issued; round-trips & stopovers are prohibited. Kids below 6 ride for free with fare-paying rider; limit 3.\n\nStarMetro offers three unlimited ride pass options: rolling 24 hours of unlimited rides for $3, rolling weekly unlimited for $10, and a rolling 31-day unlimited pass for $38.\n\n==Facilities and Infrastructure==\n\n=== C.K. Steele Plaza ===\nStarMetro's main station is C.K. Steele Plaza (\"the plaza), which was named for the Reverend [[Charles Kenzie Steele]]. It is located at 111 West Tennessee Street in downtown Tallahassee on the block bordered by Tennessee Street, Adams Street, Call Street, and Duval Street. The plaza features 24 covered gates for passenger boarding and alighting. Amenities at the plaza include restrooms, covered seating areas, bus driver lounge, and a customer service booth. Fourteen out of the 15 regularly scheduled weekday routes (Azalea, Big Bend, Dogwood, Evergreen, Forest, Gulf, Hartsfield, Killearn, Moss, Park, Red Hills, San Luis, Tall Timbers and Southwood Express) stop at the plaza, in addition to The Heritage Route serving Florida State University Campus, making it the single busiest stop in the system. In addition to StarMetro busses, Steele Plaza serves as the eastern terminus of the Gadsden Express route, which connects the residents of [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] and [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] to Tallahassee.  The new [[Havana]] [[Express bus service|Express]] connects with Big Bend & Forest Routes at Lake Jackson.\n\nPlans to renovate the plaza and turn it into a mixed-use facility to include bus bays, StarMetro office space, and even leasable office space have been proposed. However, funding has not yet been procured.\n\n=== Headquarters ===\nThe headquarters for StarMetro are located at 555 Appleyard Drive at the corner of Appleyard and Jackson Bluff Road. Only two routes pass this facility (Forest and Live Oak). Located on this property are administrative offices, a bus maintenance facility, bus parking lot, call center, and customer service window. StarMetro is planning to relocate their bus storage and maintenance facility to a larger plot of land to accommodate for their growing fleet.\n\n=== Bus Stops ===\nBus stops are referred to as Star Stops, and they are denoted by a rectangular blue sign featuring a white star, route in appropriate color that serves particular location & days of operation. Stops served exclusively by FSU Campus Routes have a different sign with the Seminole Express logo and FSU colors. Many stops have no amenities, while the busier stops and transfer points have various amenities including benches, waste containers, and/or covered shelters.\n\n=== Super-Stops ===\nStarMetro plans to construct a series of \"Super Stops\" that will serve as transfer points in places where three or more routes currently or potentially intersect. These stops will be on a smaller scale of C.K. Steele Plaza and will feature covered walkways, benches, restrooms, and vending machines. StarMetro has plans to build three Super Stops on South Adams Street, North Monroe Street, and Hartsfield Road (near Mission Road). Each Super Stop is estimated to cost $3 million to construct. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Portals/0/admin/Sales%20Tax%20Committee/Projects/2013/Project%2029%20StarMetro%20-%20Enhanced%20Infrastructure.pdf|title=StarMetro Proposed Infrastructure Sales Tax Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA temporary park, costing $300,000 is being constructed at the future South Side Super Stop on the corner of Orange and Meridian Roads.

One planned change is the addition of two new transfer stops. These stops will make it possible to travel across Tallahassee without changing buses at the downtown hub station. In addition, StarMetro is planning [[Wireless LAN|wireless internet]] and television in buses, GPS-enabled buses with live location maps over the [[Internet]], solar-lighted stops with live location maps, and blinking lights at stops to let drivers know of waiting passengers. The C.K. Steele station includes renovation and installation of information [[Kiosk|kiosks]]. Seats on the newer-model buses are made of padded plastic and are arranged front-facing in rows and sideways against the walls, much like a [[Rapid transit|subway]] car layout. All models in use except the [[Dial-A-Ride]] shuttle vans exceed 4000 pounds, and therefore are not equipped with [[Seat belt|seat belts]]. All buses are equipped with climate-control and interior lighting.\n\nStarMetro implemented a complete route overhaul dubbed \"Nova2010\" in 2010, which reduced the current system to 11 routes, of which only 4 are intended meet at CK Steele Plaza. The routes now run at closer intervals than before, while providing transfer points all over the city \u2014 no longer requiring all two-bus trips to transfer at CK Steele Plaza. Some trips may now require two transfers, but will still generally result in a more direct and faster trip than transferring at the Plaza.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Tallahassee, Florida]]\n[[Category:Bus transportation in Florida]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Leon County, Florida]]\n", "name_user": "TransportWiz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoutes:Revising Starting Date when Park Route, Trolley & Night Service will be temporailly suspended.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarMetro_(bus_service)"}
