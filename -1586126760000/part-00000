He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma.  A new copyist, Anna Holtz ([[Diane Kruger]]) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score of his symphony for the first performance.  Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer.  Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world.  Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. \n\nAnna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, \"You don't love him.\" Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, \"No. You want to be me.\" From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future. \n\nThough the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ed Harris]] as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n*[[Diane Kruger]] as Anna Holtz\n*[[Matthew Goode]] as Martin Bauer\n*[[Phyllida Law]] as Mother Canisius\n*[[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Karl van Beethoven\n*[[Ralph Riach]] as Wenzel Schlemmer\n*[[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]] as Rudy\n\n==Artistic license==\nThe working manuscript of the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is attributed to two copyists,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3049061.stm |title=Beethoven's Ninth fetches \u00a32.1m |author=BBC News |date=22 May 2003 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> both of whom were male, not a single female as depicted in the film.

Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. \n\nAnna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, \"You don't love him.\" Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, \"No. You want to be me.\" From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future. \n\nThough the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ed Harris]] as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n*[[Diane Kruger]] as Anna Holtz\n*[[Matthew Goode]] as Martin Bauer\n*[[Phyllida Law]] as Mother Canisius\n*[[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Karl van Beethoven\n*[[Ralph Riach]] as Wenzel Schlemmer\n*[[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]] as Rudy\n\n==Artistic license==\nThe working manuscript of the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is attributed to two copyists,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3049061.stm |title=Beethoven's Ninth fetches \u00a32.1m |author=BBC News |date=22 May 2003 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> both of whom were male, not a single female as depicted in the film.

The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.\n\nA common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation (creative process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents \"the people\" as a morally good force and contrasts them against \"the elite\", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how \"the people\" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present \"the elite\" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups\u2014such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants\u2014above the interests of \"the people\". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the \"voice of the people\". According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]], and there exist both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].\n\nOther scholars of the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant [[Power (social and political)|power structures]]. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse\u2014where the term has often been used pejoratively\u2014it has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.\n\nThe term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the [[Russian Empire]] it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among [[social science|social scientists]] in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly common in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties. When in office in liberal democracies, populists have often been responsible for [[democratic backsliding]] \u2013 also called \"democratic erosion\" or \"de-democratisation\" \u2013 as they undermine independent institutions like the media or judiciary which they consider hostile to the \"will of the people\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201393; 95\u201396}}<ref>{{Cite

the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is \"one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time\".{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=162}}\n\nThe term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=5|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148}} In the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period, a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2pp=5\u20136}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=14}} In the 1920s, the term entered the [[French language]], where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} Following 2016, the year which saw the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and [[2016

|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as \"populists\".{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], \"there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.\"{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like \"[[socialism]]\" or \"[[conservatism]]\", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Tormey|3y=2018|3p=260}} Instead it shares similarities with terms such as \"[[Far-left politics|far left]]\", \"[[Far-right politics|far right]]\", or \"[[Extremism|extremist]]\", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}}\n \nIn popular discourse, the term \"populism\" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]],{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=1}} and generally presented as something to be \"feared and discredited\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to [[democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2p=260}} The political scientists Yves M\u00e9ny and Yves Surel noted that \"populism\" had become \"a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy.\"{{sfn|M\u00e9ny|Surel|2002|p=3}} Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=243|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as \"populists\" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that \"Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Labour Party]] declared: \"we are and will be called populists.\"{{sfn|March|2007|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n===Use in academia===\n\nUntil the 1950s, use of the term ''populism'' remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the U.S. sociologist [[Edward Shils]] published an article proposing ''populism'' as a term to describe anti-elite trends in U.S. society more broadly.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|pp=372\u2013373}} Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term \"populism\" became increasingly popular among [[sociology|sociologists]] and other academics in the [[social sciences]].{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the [[London School of Economics]], the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|p=378}} As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as \"populism studies\" emerged.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in \"bursts\" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=63}}\n\n[[File:Cas Mudde in 2018 05.jpg|thumb|left|The Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde has been among those arguing that political scientists should use the term ''populism'' despite its problems]]\n\nCanovan noted that \"if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} From examining how the term \"populism\" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of \"agrarian populism\"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of \"political populism\", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=13|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2pp=550\u2013551}} She noted that these were \"analytical constructs\" and that \"real-life examples may well overlap several categories\",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}} In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=6}}\n\nThe confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that \"while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Similarly, Canovan noted that the term \"does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas\" and that it \"provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that \"if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that \"although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=100}}\n\nAlthough academic definitions of ''populism'' have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between \"the people\" and \"the elite\",{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=2}} Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=3}} These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=149}} varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and different historical periods.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=v}}\n\n==Ideational definition==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=A thin-centred ideology that

populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In this definition, the term ''populism'' is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to \"the people\" and then contrast this group against \"the elite\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=487}} \n\nAdopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that \"pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as \"a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}}\n\nIn this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of \"an antagonistic relationship\" between \"the people\" and \"the elite\", and is \"latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a \"homogenous community-people\" which \"perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty\" and \"expresses an anti-establishment attitude.\"{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=8}} This understanding conceives of populism as a [[discourse]], [[ideology]], or [[worldview]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}\n\nAccording to this approach, populism is viewed as a \"thin ideology\" or \"thin-centred ideology\" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for

Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referenda]] and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that \"support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}\nPopulist notions of the \"general will\" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of \"[[common sense]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=18}}\n\n===Versus elitism and pluralism===\n\n[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]\n\nStanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to \"the people\" had become \"an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice\", with elections and referenda predicated on the notion that \"the people\" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements.

Boyte for example defined populism as \"a politics of civic agency\" which \"develops the power of 'the people' to shape their destiny\", as examples citing both the Russian narodniks and the South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]].{{sfn|Boyte|2012|p=173}}\n\nThe socioeconomic definition of populism applies the term to what it regards as an irresponsible form of economic policy by which a government engages in a period of massive public spending financed by foreign loans, after which the country falls into [[hyperinflation]] and harsh economic adjustments are then imposed.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} This use of the term was used by economists like [[Rudiger Dornbusch]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and was particularly popular among scholars of Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} Since that time, this definition continued to be used by some economists and journalists, particularly in the US, but was uncommon among other [[social sciences]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} This definition relies on focusing on socialist and other left-wing forms of populism; it does not apply to other groups commonly understood as populist which adopted right-wing stances on economic issues.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}}\n\nAn additional framework has been described as the \"political-strategic\" approach.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}} This applies the term ''populism'' to a political strategy in which a charismatic leader seeks to govern based on direct and unmediated connection with their followers.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=4|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} [[Kurt Weyland]] defined this conception of ''populism'' as \"a political strategy through which a personalist leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1pp=153-154|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=6}} This is a definition of the term that is popular among scholars of non-Western societies.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=4}} By focusing on leadership, this concept of ''populism'' does not allow for the existence of populist parties or populist social movements;{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=6}} under this definition, for instance, the U.S. People's Party which first invented the term ''populism'' could not be considered populist.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=154}} Mudde suggested that although the idea of a leader having direct access to \"the people\" was a common element among populists, it is best regarded as a feature which facilitates rather than defines populism.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=545}}\n\nIn popular discourse, ''populism'' is sometimes used in a negative sense in reference to politics which involves promoting extremely simple solutions to complex problems in a highly emotional manner.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde suggested that this definition \"seems to have instinctive value\" but was difficult to employ empirically because almost all political groups engage in sloganeering and because it can be difficult to differentiate an argument made emotionally from one made rationally.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Mudde thought that this phenomenon was better termed ''[[demagogy]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} Another use of the term in popular discourse is to describe opportunistic policies designed to quickly please voters rather than deciding a more rational course of action.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}} Examples of this would include a governing political party lowering taxes before an election or promising to provide things to the electorate which the state cannot afford to pay for.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=542\u201343}} Mudde suggested that this phenomenon is better described as ''[[political opportunism|opportunism]]'' rather than ''populism''.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=542}}\n\n==Mobilisation==\n\nThere are three forms of political mobilisation which populists have adopted: that of the populist leader, the populist political party, and the populist social movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=42\u201343|2a1=Gagnon|2a2=Beausoleil|2a3=Son|2a4=Arguelles|2y=2018|2p=vi}} The reasons why voters are attracted to populists differ, but common catalysts for the rise of populists include dramatic economic decline or a systematic corruption scandal that damages established political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} For instance, the [[Great Recession]] of 2007 and its impact on the economies of southern Europe was a catalyst for the rise of [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' corruption scandal of the early 1990s played a significant part in the rise of the Italian populist [[Silvio Berlusconi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=100}} Another catalyst for the growth of populism is a widespread perception among voters that the political system is unresponsive to them.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=101}} This can arise when elected governments introduce policies that are unpopular with their voters but which are implemented because they are considered to be \"responsible\" or imposed by supranational organisations; in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many [[Member state of the European Union|countries in the European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic [[austerity]] measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===Leaders===\nPopulism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders,{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=268}} and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"the quintessential form of populist mobilisation\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with \"the people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of \"the people\" themselves,{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=43|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=197}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or \"voice of the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=62|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=204}} Chavez for instance stated: \"I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=202}} Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded \"enemies of the people\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=7}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] was the wife of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[Marine Le Pen]] the daughter of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of [[Alberto Fujimori]], and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n====Rhetorical styles====\n\n{{Multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Sarah Palin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Silvio Berlusconi (2010) cropped.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Populist leaders often play on gendered stereotypes.

Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}}\n\nPopulist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the \"elite\". Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant \"old boys' club\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=69\u201370}} while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Other populists have used clothing to set them apart.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] and members of his [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as [[Ross Perot]], Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=70\u201371}}\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that \"in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite\", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"true outsiders\" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Ch\u00e1vez and Peru's Fujimori.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=74\u201375}} More common is that they are \"insider-outsiders\", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=75}} The Dutch right-wing populist [[Geert Wilders]] had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist [[Party for Freedom]],{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}} while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing [[African National Congress]] (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=111}} Only a few populist leaders are \"insiders\", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party;{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} another is [[Rafael Correa]], who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = RETRATO FOTOGR\u00c1FICO DE PER\u00d3N.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Pim Fortuyn - May 4.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Some populist leaders give their name to wider populist political movements;

these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Me\u010diar, and Thailand's [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\nPopulism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} Rather than being populists, many strongmen\u2014such as Spain's Francisco Franco\u2014were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\n\nIn most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=43\u201344}} These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like [[Fortuynism]] in the Netherlands, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, [[Berlusconism]] in Italy and [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=42}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}} Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}}\n\n===Political parties===\n\n[[File:Acto de Posesion del Gobernador Arias Cardenas.jpg|thumb|right|A 2012 rally by members of the left-wing populist United Socialist Party of Venezuela in [[Maracaibo]]]]\n\nA second form of mobilisation is through the form of the populist political party.\nPopulists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of \"the people\", in power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=10}} the elitist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a Marxist-Leninist group which governed [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355}} In other instances, such as the Austrian FP\u00d6 and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=55}}\n\nIn some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's [[Justicialist Party]] after Juan Per\u00f3n's death in 1974, or the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] after Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when [[Marine Le Pen]] replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nMany populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}\n\n[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]]s are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Examples of this have been the support given by ''Kronen Zeitung'' to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses' support for Italy's [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] in the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the [[quality press]].{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=942}} In the 21st century, populist parties have increasingly used [[social media]] to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences.{{sfn|Stier|Posch|Bleier|Strohmaier|2017|p=1365}}\n\n===Social movements===\n\n[[File:Madrid - Acampada Sol 2011 43.JPG|\"Hear the wrath of the people,\" a member of the Indignados, a Spanish left-wing populist movement, in [[Puerta del Sol]]|thumb|right|170px]]\n\nAn additional form is that of the populist social movement.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=10}} Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with \"the people\" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the [[Occupy movement]], which originated in the US and used the slogan \"We are the 99%\", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: \"real democracy now \u2013 we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}\n\nFew populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (\"Common Man Party\").{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=56\u201357|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2pp=266\u201367}} These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the U.S. during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and [[Bernie Sanders]] as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=11}}\n\nSome populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}} These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}}\n\n==Other themes==\n\n===Democracy===\n\nThere have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only \"true\" form of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=79}} Populists often present themselves as \"true democrats\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were \"inextricably linked\",{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=10}} the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being \"deeply connected with democracy\",{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=2}} and March suggested that populism represented a \"critique of democracy, not an alternative to it\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that \"In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}}\n\nPopulism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=72|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=83, 84}} It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=72\u201373}} When some populists have taken power\u2014most notable Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela\u2014they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referenda.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93\u201394}} For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: [[Ren\u00e9 Cuperus]] of the [[Dutch Labour Party]] for instance called for [[social democracy]] to become \"more 'populist' in a leftist way\" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Referendum 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been cited as a populist leader who has undermined liberal democracy on taking power{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}]]\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that \"populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy,\" since populism is based on putting into effect \"the will of the people\". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201381}} Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the \"general will\" of \"the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=73|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=81|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=493}} In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] described as the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\nPopulists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating,{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=56}} and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances\u2014such as Orban in Hungary\u2014the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}} A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.<ref>Jordan Kyle, Yascha Mounk, [https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy \"The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment], Institute for Global Change, 26 December 2018, accessed 29 March 2019</ref>\n\nEven when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}\n\n===Mainstream responses===\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who \"claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented \"them\" as \"evil\" or \"foolish\", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, \"the best way to deal with populism is to engage\u2014as difficult as it is\u2014in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters\" in order to \"better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In trying to win over populist supporters, and perhaps even some elites, liberal democrats should avoid both simplistic solutions that pander to \"the people\" and elitist discourses that dismiss the moral and intellectual competence of ordinary citizens \u2013 both will only strengthen the populists.

Europe ===\n\n{{main|Draft:Populism in Europe}}\n\n====19th and 20th centuries====\n\nIn the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the ''[[narodnichestvo]]'' movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}} The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals \"going to the people\", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} According to Eatwell, the narodniks \"are often seen as the first populist movement\".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]\n\nIn German-speaking Europe, the [[v\u00f6lkisch movement]] has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} In France, the [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|Boulangist movement]] also utilised populist rhetoric and themes.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=366\u2013367}} In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}\n\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33\u201334}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=548|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=66}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became \"a relevant political force in Europe\", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of \"the people\" against the \"elite\", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan \"Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a \"real\" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} The collapse of Marxism-Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the [[Dutch Socialist Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and German's [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party.{{sfn|March|2007|p=67}} Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz Mateos]], [[Jes\u00fas Gil]] and [[Mario Conde]], businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the

Hague repeatedly referring to it as \"metropolitan\", implying that it was out of touch with \"the people\", who in Conservative discourse are represented by \"Middle England\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.{{sfn|Bang|Marsh|2018|p=354}}\n\nBy the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like J\u00f6rg Haider's FP\u00d6 in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the [[Syriza]] party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}\n\n=== North America ===\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|header=|header_align=left/right/center|header_background=|footer=The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, respectively|footer_align=left/right/center|footer_background=|width=|image1=Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|width1=250|caption1=|image2=Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=250|caption2=}}\n\nIn North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with [[agrarianism]] and often known as \"prairie populism\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} For these groups, \"the people\" were yeomen\u2014small, independent farmers \u2014while the \"elite\" were the bankers and politicians of the northeast.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} In some cases, populist activists called for alliances with labor (the first national platform of the National People's Party in 1892 calling for protecting the rights of \"urban workmen\".{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=90}} In the state of Georgia in the early 1890s, Tom Watson (later the Populist candidate for Vice-President) led a major effort to unite white and African-American farmers.{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=118}}{{sfn|Woodward|1938}}\n\nThe [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] of the late 19th century United States is considered to be \"one of the defining populist movements\";{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} its members were often referred to as the Populists at the time.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referenda.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=17}} The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge. In the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]], the People's Party supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]; after his defeat, the People's Party's support declined.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1pp=17\u201318, 44\u201346|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=23}} Other early populist political parties in the United States included the [[United States Greenback Party|Greenback Party]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party of 1912]] led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party of 1924]] led by [[Robert M.

Wallace]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] and [[Ross Perot]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=25}} These politicians presented a consisted message that a \"liberal elite\" was threatening \"our way of life\" and using the welfare state to placate the poor and thus maintain their own power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=25}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, two populist movements appeared in the US, both in response to the [[Great Recession]]: the [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Tea Party movement]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=26}} The populist approach of the Occupy movement was broader, with its \"people\" being what it called \"[[We are the 99%|the 99%]]\", while the \"elite\" it challenged was presented as both the economic and political elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26\u201327}} The Tea Party's populism was [[producerist|Producerism]], while \"the elite\" it presented was more party partisan than that of Occupy, being defined largely\u2014although not exclusively\u2014as the Democratic administration of President [[Barack Obama]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=26\u201327}}\nThe [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie

===\n{{Main|Populism in Latin America}}\n[[File:2019 Encontro Bilateral com o Presidente dos EUA.jpg|thumb|Brazilian President [[Jair Bolsonaro]], sometimes called a \"Tropical Trump\", with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]]]\nPopulism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s,{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}} being far more prevalent here than in Europe.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's \"most enduring and prevalent populist tradition\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27\u201328}} March instead thought that it was the important role of \"catch-all parties and prominent personalities\" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}}\n\nThe first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising \"the people\": these included [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] in Argentina, and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=196}} These relied on the ''[[Americanismo]]'' ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from [[imperialism|imperialist]] powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} The second wave took place in the early 1990s;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} de la Torre called it \"neoliberal populism\".{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=198}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), stabilizing the economy and ending hyperinflation.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=199}} Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}}\n\nThe third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} It overlapped in part with the [[pink tide]] of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=31|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty \"back to the people\", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=32|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=200}} In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=201}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=38}}\n\nIn New Zealand, [[Robert Muldoon]], the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Feisty, Protectionist Populism?

These have included Kenya's [[Raila Odinga]], Senegal's [[Abdoulaye Wade]], South Africa's [[Julius Malema]], and Zambia's [[Michael Sata]].{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=106}} These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n===Asia and the Arab world===\n\n[[File:President Rodrigo Roa Duterte poses for a photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the start of the bilateral meeting at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] of [[Philippines]] and [[Narendra Modi]] of [[India]], they are both considered populist leaders]]\n\nIn North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Turkey's [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=39\u201340}} Although the [[Arab Spring]] was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=40}}\n\nIn southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38\u201339}}\nIn India, the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=484}} Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=485}}\n\n===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===\nIn the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the \"New Populism\".{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} The UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=260}} By 2016, \"populism\" was regularly used by political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The rise of populism in Western Europe is, in large part, a reaction to the failure of traditional parties to respond adequately in the eyes of the electorate to a series of phenomena such as [[economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalisation]], the speed and direction of [[European integration]], immigration, the decline of ideologies and class politics, exposure of elite corruption, etc. It is also the product of a much-cited, but rarely defined, \"political malaise\", manifested in steadily falling [[voter turnout]] across Western Europe, declining [[political party]] membership, and ever-greater numbers of citizens in surveys citing a lack of interest and distrust in politics and politicians.|source=Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=1}} }}\n\nMudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103\u2013104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the \"[[high culture]]\" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}\n\nMudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, \"More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.\"{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nAnother factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555\u201356}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nPeter Wilkins argued that \"The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements.\"<ref>Wilkins, Peter (2018) [http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 \"Rip It Up and Start Again: The Challenge of Populism in the 21st Century\"] in ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]''. v.24, no.22, p.317</ref> In [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash] Pippa Norris and Ronald F. Inglehart examine two theories on the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in [[post-industrial economy|post-industrial economies]]. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking stronger authoritarian populist leaders such as [[Donald Trump]] and [[Nigel Farage]].  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.{{sfn|Inglehart|Norris|2016|p=1-2|pp=29-30|loc=Bibliography}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Black populism]]\n* [[Communitarianism]]\n* [[List of populists]]\n* [[Ochlocracy]] (mob rule)\n* [[Paternalism]]\n* [[Penal populism]]\n* [[Politainment]]\n* [[Poporanism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n: {{cite chapter|last=Abi-Hassan|first=Sahar|chapter=Populism and Gender|year=2017|title=The Oxford Handbook of Populism|editors=Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser, Paul Taggart, Paulina Ochoa Espejo, and Pierre Ostiguy|location=Oxford and New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=426\u2013445|isbn=9780198803560|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Populism and Democracy: Challenge or Pathology?|url=|journal=Acta Politica|year=2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500021|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Friend or Foe?

The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.\n\nA common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation (creative process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents \"the people\" as a morally good force and contrasts them against \"the elite\", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how \"the people\" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present \"the elite\" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups\u2014such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants\u2014above the interests of \"the people\". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the \"voice of the people\". According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]], and there exist both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].\n\nOther scholars of the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant [[Power (social and political)|power structures]]. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse\u2014where the term has often been used pejoratively\u2014it has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.\n\nThe term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the [[Russian Empire]] it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among [[social science|social scientists]] in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly common in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties. When in office in liberal democracies, populists have often been responsible for [[democratic backsliding]] \u2013 also called \"democratic erosion\" or \"de-democratisation\" \u2013 as they undermine independent institutions like the media or judiciary which they consider hostile to the \"will of the people\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201393; 95\u201396}}<ref>{{Cite

Canovan on how the term ''populism'' was used, 1981{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=3}} }}\n\nThe word ''populism'' is a vague and contested term that has been used in reference to a diverse variety of phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=3|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2p=544|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2|5a1=Anselmi|5y=2018|5p=5|6a1=Hawkins|6a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|6y=2019|6p=3}} The political scientist Will Brett characterised it as \"a classic example of a stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse\",{{sfn|Brett|2013|p=410}} while the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is \"one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time\".{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=162}}\n\nThe term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=5|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148}} In the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period, a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2pp=5\u20136}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=14}} In the 1920s, the term entered the [[French language]], where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} Following 2016, the year which saw the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union]]\u2014both events linked to populism\u2014the word ''populism'' became one of the most widely

|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as \"populists\".{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], \"there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.\"{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like \"[[socialism]]\" or \"[[conservatism]]\", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Tormey|3y=2018|3p=260}} Instead it shares similarities with terms such as \"[[Far-left politics|far left]]\", \"[[Far-right politics|far right]]\", or \"[[Extremism|extremist]]\", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}}\n \nIn popular discourse, the term \"populism\" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]],{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=1}} and generally presented as something to be \"feared and discredited\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to [[democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2p=260}} The political scientists Yves M\u00e9ny and Yves Surel noted that \"populism\" had become \"a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy.\"{{sfn|M\u00e9ny|Surel|2002|p=3}} Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=243|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as \"populists\" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that \"Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Labour Party]] declared: \"we are and will be called populists.\"{{sfn|March|2007|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n===Use in academia===\n\nUntil the 1950s, use of the term ''populism'' remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the U.S. sociologist [[Edward Shils]] published an article proposing ''populism'' as a term to describe anti-elite trends in U.S. society more broadly.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|pp=372\u2013373}} Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term \"populism\" became increasingly popular among [[sociology|sociologists]] and other academics in the [[social sciences]].{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the [[London School of Economics]], the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|p=378}} As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as \"populism studies\" emerged.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in \"bursts\" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=63}}\n\n[[File:Cas Mudde in 2018 05.jpg|thumb|left|The Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde has been among those arguing that political scientists should use the term ''populism'' despite its problems]]\n\nCanovan noted that \"if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} From examining how the term \"populism\" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of \"agrarian populism\"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of \"political populism\", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=13|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2pp=550\u2013551}} She noted that these were \"analytical constructs\" and that \"real-life examples may well overlap several categories\",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}} In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=6}}\n\nThe confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that \"while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Similarly, Canovan noted that the term \"does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas\" and that it \"provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that \"if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that \"although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=100}}\n\nAlthough academic definitions of ''populism'' have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between \"the people\" and \"the elite\",{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=2}} Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=3}} These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=149}} varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and different historical periods.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=v}}\n\n==Ideational definition==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=A thin-centred ideology that

populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In this definition, the term ''populism'' is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to \"the people\" and then contrast this group against \"the elite\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=487}} \n\nAdopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that \"pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as \"a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}}\n\nIn this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of \"an antagonistic relationship\" between \"the people\" and \"the elite\", and is \"latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a \"homogenous community-people\" which \"perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty\" and \"expresses an anti-establishment attitude.\"{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=8}} This understanding conceives of populism as a [[discourse]], [[ideology]], or [[worldview]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}\n\nAccording to this approach, populism is viewed as a \"thin ideology\" or \"thin-centred ideology\" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the \"thick-centred\" or \"full\" ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[liberalism]], and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=64|3a1=Stanley|3y=2008|3pp=95, 99\u2013100, 106|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=6|5a1=Hawkins|5a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|5y=2019|5pp=4\u20135}} Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of [[nationalism]], liberalism, socialism, [[federalism]], or conservatism.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} According to Stanley, \"the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}\n\nPopulism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}}\nMudde noted that populism is \"moralistic rather than programmatic\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into \"friends and foes\", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have \"different priorities and values\" but as being fundamentally \"evil\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of \"the elite\", from which \"the people\" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}}\n\n===Right and left-wing===\n\nAs a result of the various different ideologies which populism can be paired with, the forms that populism can take vary widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=6|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=4}} Populism itself cannot be positioned on the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=294|2a1=Brett|2y=2013|2p=410|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=8}} and both right and left-wing populisms exist.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=65|2a1=Abi-Hassan|2y=2017|2p=428|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Populist movements can also confound obvious divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=vi}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=[Populism's] core consists of four distinct but interrelated concepts:\n* The existence of two homogeneous units of analysis: 'the people' and 'the elite'.\n* The antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite.\n* The idea of popular sovereignty.\n* The positive valorisation of 'the people' and denigration of 'the elite'.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Ben Stanley{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} }}\n\nThe ideologies which populism can be paired with can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's [[Alberto Fujimori]] who promoted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela's [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] who promoted socialist programmes.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=8\u20139}} As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy's [[Beppe Grillo]] have been characterised as [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]],{{sfn|Brett|2013|pp=410\u2013411}} while groups like Turkey's [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] have been described as combining populism with [[Islamism]],{{sfn|Park|2018|p=170}} and India's [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been seen as mixing populism with [[Hindu nationalism]].{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=495}} Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist [[Syriza]] and the right-wing populist [[Independent Greeks]] in 2015.{{sfn|Aslanidis|Rovira Kaltwasser|2016|p=1078}}\n\nAdherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists. The latter are presented as juxtaposing \"the people\" against both \"the elite\" and an additional group who are also regarded as being separate from \"the people\" and whom \"the elite\" is seen to favour, such as immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or communists.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|pp=487\u2013488}}\nPopulist leaders thus \"come in many different shades and sizes\" but, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, share one common element: \"a carefully crafted image of the vox populi\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=20}} Stanley expressed the view that although there are \"certain family resemblances\" that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was \"no coherent tradition\" unifying all of them.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}\nWhile many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the [[vanguard of the proletariat]], by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the \"voice of the people\" more widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=549\u201350|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=67}} On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with \"the people\" and \"the nation\" becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}}\nSome political scientists have also argued that populism can be divided into \"inclusionary\" and \"exclusionary\" forms.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=147}}\n\n===\"The People\"===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Populists (claim to) speak in the name of the 'oppressed people', and they want to emancipate them by making them aware of their oppression.

Antisemitic populists often accuse \"the elite\" of being made up of many Jews as well.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, \"the elite\" can sometimes be presented as \"ethnic traitors\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}\n\n===General will===\n\nA third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or ''volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale''.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=16}} An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Ch\u00e1vez's 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that \"All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence.

Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referenda]] and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that \"support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}\nPopulist notions of the \"general will\" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of \"[[common sense]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=18}}\n\n===Versus elitism and pluralism===\n\n[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]\n\nStanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to \"the people\" had become \"an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice\", with elections and referenda predicated on the notion that \"the people\" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements.

Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view \"the people\" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and \"the elites\" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=543\u201344|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some\u2014such as Spain's [[Francisco Franco]] and Chile's [[Augusto Pinochet]]\u2014reject democracy altogether, while others\u2014like Spain's [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] and Austria's [[Joseph Schumpeter]]\u2014support a limited model of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=7}}\n\nPluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7|3a1=Hawkins|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2019|3p=4}} Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group\u2014whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership\u2014and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=7\u20138}} Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a \"general will\" exists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=152}} Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}\n\n==Other definitions==\n\nThe popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}}\n\n[[File:Presentaci\u00f3n del Documental CATASTROIKA y Presentaci\u00f3n de la Revista Debates y Combates (7215329954).jpg|thumb|left|The Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] developed his own definition of populism.

in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many [[Member state of the European Union|countries in the European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic [[austerity]] measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===Leaders===\nPopulism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders,{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=268}} and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"the quintessential form of populist mobilisation\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with \"the people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of \"the people\" themselves,{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=43|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=197}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or \"voice of the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=62|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=204}} Chavez for instance stated: \"I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=202}} Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded \"enemies of the people\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=7}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] was the wife of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[Marine Le Pen]] the daughter of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of [[Alberto Fujimori]], and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n====Rhetorical styles====\n\n{{Multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Sarah Palin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Silvio Berlusconi (2010) cropped.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Populist leaders often play on gendered stereotypes.

Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant \"old boys' club\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=69\u201370}} while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Other populists have used clothing to set them apart.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] and members of his [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as [[Ross Perot]], Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=70\u201371}}\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that \"in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite\", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"true outsiders\" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Ch\u00e1vez and Peru's Fujimori.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=74\u201375}} More common is that they are \"insider-outsiders\", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=75}} The Dutch right-wing populist [[Geert Wilders]] had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist [[Party for Freedom]],{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}} while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing [[African National Congress]] (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=111}} Only a few populist leaders are \"insiders\", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party;{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} another is [[Rafael Correa]], who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = RETRATO FOTOGR\u00c1FICO DE PER\u00d3N.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Pim Fortuyn - May 4.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Some populist leaders give their name to wider populist political movements;

these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Me\u010diar, and Thailand's [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\nPopulism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} Rather than being populists, many strongmen\u2014such as Spain's Francisco Franco\u2014were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\n\nIn most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=43\u201344}} These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like [[Fortuynism]] in the Netherlands, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, [[Berlusconism]] in Italy and [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=42}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}} Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}}\n\n===Political parties===\n\n[[File:Acto de Posesion del Gobernador Arias Cardenas.jpg|thumb|right|A 2012 rally by members of the left-wing populist United Socialist Party of Venezuela in [[Maracaibo]]]]\n\nA second form of mobilisation is through the form of the populist political party.\nPopulists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of \"the people\", in power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=10}} the elitist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a Marxist-Leninist group which governed [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355}} In other instances, such as the Austrian FP\u00d6 and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=55}}\n\nIn some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's [[Justicialist Party]] after Juan Per\u00f3n's death in 1974, or the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] after Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when [[Marine Le Pen]] replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nMany populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}\n\n[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]]s are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Examples of this have been the support given by ''Kronen Zeitung'' to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses' support for Italy's [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] in the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the [[quality press]].{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=942}} In the 21st century, populist parties have increasingly used [[social media]] to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences.{{sfn|Stier|Posch|Bleier|Strohmaier|2017|p=1365}}\n\n===Social movements===\n\n[[File:Madrid - Acampada Sol 2011 43.JPG|\"Hear the wrath of the people,\" a member of the Indignados, a Spanish left-wing populist movement, in [[Puerta del Sol]]|thumb|right|170px]]\n\nAn additional form is that of the populist social movement.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=10}} Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with \"the people\" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the [[Occupy movement]], which originated in the US and used the slogan \"We are the 99%\", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: \"real democracy now \u2013 we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}\n\nFew populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (\"Common Man Party\").{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=56\u201357|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2pp=266\u201367}} These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the U.S. during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and [[Bernie Sanders]] as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=11}}\n\nSome populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}} These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}}\n\n==Other themes==\n\n===Democracy===\n\nThere have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only \"true\" form of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=79}} Populists often present themselves as \"true democrats\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were \"inextricably linked\",{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=10}} the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being \"deeply connected with democracy\",{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=2}} and March suggested that populism represented a \"critique of democracy, not an alternative to it\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that \"In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}}\n\nPopulism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=72|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=83, 84}} It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=72\u201373}} When some populists have taken power\u2014most notable Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela\u2014they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referenda.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93\u201394}} For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: [[Ren\u00e9 Cuperus]] of the [[Dutch Labour Party]] for instance called for [[social democracy]] to become \"more 'populist' in a leftist way\" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Referendum 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been cited as a populist leader who has undermined liberal democracy on taking power{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}]]\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that \"populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy,\" since populism is based on putting into effect \"the will of the people\". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201381}} Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the \"general will\" of \"the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=73|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=81|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=493}} In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] described as the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\nPopulists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating,{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=56}} and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances\u2014such as Orban in Hungary\u2014the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}} A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.<ref>Jordan Kyle, Yascha Mounk, [https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy \"The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment], Institute for Global Change, 26 December 2018, accessed 29 March 2019</ref>\n\nEven when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}\n\n===Mainstream responses===\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who \"claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented \"them\" as \"evil\" or \"foolish\", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, \"the best way to deal with populism is to engage\u2014as difficult as it is\u2014in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters\" in order to \"better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In trying to win over populist supporters, and perhaps even some elites, liberal democrats should avoid both simplistic solutions that pander to \"the people\" and elitist discourses that dismiss the moral and intellectual competence of ordinary citizens \u2013 both will only strengthen the populists.

Europe ===\n\n{{main|Draft:Populism in Europe}}\n\n====19th and 20th centuries====\n\nIn the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the ''[[narodnichestvo]]'' movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}} The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals \"going to the people\", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} According to Eatwell, the narodniks \"are often seen as the first populist movement\".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]\n\nIn German-speaking Europe, the [[v\u00f6lkisch movement]] has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} In France, the [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|Boulangist movement]] also utilised populist rhetoric and themes.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=366\u2013367}} In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}\n\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33\u201334}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=548|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=66}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became \"a relevant political force in Europe\", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of \"the people\" against the \"elite\", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan \"Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a \"real\" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal

(Germany)|The Left]] party.{{sfn|March|2007|p=67}} Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz Mateos]], [[Jes\u00fas Gil]] and

For example, in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the 2001 electoral campaign]], the Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] accused [[Tony Blair]]'s governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of representing \"the condescending liberal elite\". Hague repeatedly referring to it as \"metropolitan\", implying that it was out of touch with \"the people\", who in Conservative discourse are represented by \"Middle England\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.{{sfn|Bang|Marsh|2018|p=354}}\n\nBy the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like J\u00f6rg Haider's FP\u00d6 in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the [[Syriza]] party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}\n\n=== North America ===\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|header=|header_align=left/right/center|header_background=|footer=The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, respectively|footer_align=left/right/center|footer_background=|width=|image1=Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|width1=250|caption1=|image2=Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=250|caption2=}}\n\nIn North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States.

===\n{{Main|Populism in Latin America}}\n[[File:2019 Encontro Bilateral com o Presidente dos EUA.jpg|thumb|Brazilian President [[Jair Bolsonaro]], sometimes called a \"Tropical Trump\", with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]]]\nPopulism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s,{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}} being far more prevalent here than in Europe.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's \"most enduring and prevalent populist tradition\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27\u201328}} March instead thought that it was the important role of \"catch-all parties and prominent personalities\" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}}\n\nThe first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising \"the people\": these included [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] in Argentina, and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=de la

powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} The second wave took place in the early 1990s;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} de la Torre called it \"neoliberal populism\".{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=198}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International

second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}}\n\nThe third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} It overlapped in part with the [[pink tide]] of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=31|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty \"back to the people\", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=32|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=200}} In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=201}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=38}}\n\nIn New Zealand, [[Robert Muldoon]], the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Feisty, Protectionist Populism?

In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38\u201339}}\nIn India, the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=484}} Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=485}}\n\n===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===\nIn the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the \"New Populism\".{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} The UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=260}} By 2016, \"populism\" was regularly used by political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The rise of populism in Western Europe is, in large part, a reaction to the failure of traditional parties to respond adequately in the eyes of the electorate to a series of phenomena such as [[economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalisation]], the speed and direction of [[European integration]], immigration, the decline of ideologies and class politics, exposure of elite corruption, etc. It is also the product of a much-cited, but rarely defined, \"political malaise\", manifested in steadily falling [[voter turnout]] across Western Europe, declining [[political party]] membership, and ever-greater numbers of citizens in surveys citing a lack of interest and distrust in politics and politicians.|source=Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=1}} }}\n\nMudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103\u2013104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the \"[[high culture]]\" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}\n\nMudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, \"More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.\"{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nAnother factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555\u201356}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nPeter Wilkins argued that \"The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements.\"<ref>Wilkins, Peter (2018) [http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 \"Rip It Up and Start Again: The Challenge of Populism in the 21st Century\"] in ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]''. v.24, no.22, p.317</ref> In [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash] Pippa Norris and Ronald F. Inglehart examine two theories on the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in [[post-industrial economy|post-industrial economies]]. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking stronger authoritarian populist leaders such as [[Donald Trump]] and [[Nigel Farage]].  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.{{sfn|Inglehart|Norris|2016|p=1-2|pp=29-30|loc=Bibliography}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Black populism]]\n* [[Communitarianism]]\n* [[List of populists]]\n* [[Ochlocracy]] (mob rule)\n* [[Paternalism]]\n* [[Penal populism]]\n* [[Politainment]]\n* [[Poporanism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n: {{cite chapter|last=Abi-Hassan|first=Sahar|chapter=Populism and Gender|year=2017|title=The Oxford Handbook of Populism|editors=Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser, Paul Taggart, Paulina Ochoa Espejo, and Pierre Ostiguy|location=Oxford and New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=426\u2013445|isbn=9780198803560|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Populism and Democracy: Challenge or Pathology?|url=|journal=Acta Politica|year=2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500021|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Friend or Foe?

{"title_page": "Thomas Coutts (colonist)", "text_new": "'''Thomas Coutts''' (11 December 1797 \u2013 14 January 1868) was a Scottish colonist who moved to Australia during the 19th century establishing various enterprises including [[whaling in Australia|whaling]] and [[pastoral farming]] businesses. He is best known for perpetrating a [[mass poisonings of Aboriginal Australians|mass poisoning]] of [[Aboriginal Australians]] on a property near the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in the [[Northern Rivers]] area of [[New South Wales]], which killed at least 23 people. Although Coutts was arrested for this crime, the judicial authorities never put the case to trial and he was released after the payment of bail. Coutts afterwards became a prosperous and respected colonial figure. The town of [[Coutts Crossing, New South Wales|Coutts Crossing]] is named after him.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Coutts was born in [[Glenmuick]], [[Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]] on 11 December 1797. His parents were James and Elizabeth Coutts.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Gordon Family Tree |url=https://sites.rootsweb.com/~gordon/gordonfam/pafg43.htm#1345 |website=Rootsweb |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> He emigrated with two of his brothers to the British colony of New South Wales around 1817. He settled in Sydney and it appears that Coutts chose to follow a seafaring vocation. By the 1830s he became a [[master mariner]], taking the title of Captain Thomas Coutts.<ref name=\"couttsclan\">{{cite web |last1=Coutts |first1=Malcolm |title=Capt Thomas & Rev James |url=https://clancoutts.ning.com/page/capt-thomas-rev-james |website=Clan Coutts Society |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Whaling==\nIn 1832, Coutts and his brothers built a 90 tonne [[brig]] on the banks of the [[Georges River]]. They named the vessel the ''Lady Leith'' and Thomas Coutts was registered as both the owner and master of the brig. Initially the ''Lady Leith'' was utilised to transport cargo from Sydney to [[Hobart]] but soon was trading in sugar between [[Mauritius]] and Australia. It seems this wasn't a profitable trade as Coutts quickly switched to using his vessel as a whaler.<ref name=\"couttsclan\" /> From the mid 1830s until 1840, Coutts captained the ''Lady Leith'' in regular voyages to the whaling grounds off New Zealand, returning with cargoes of [[sperm whale]] oil for sale in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31722620 |title=Projected Departures|newspaper=[[The Colonist]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 February 1839 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref> During this period, Coutts married Maria Bloodworth in 1834 and bought a house in O'Connell Street in Sydney.<ref name=\"couttsfam\">{{cite web |title=Thomas Coutts |url=http://www.whosyerdad-e.com/families-w/individual.php?pid=I2292&ged=white.ged |website=whosyerdad-e |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Pastoral farming==\nIn early 1840, Coutts placed the ''Lady Leith'' up for sale and started to invest in [[pastoral farming]]. He and several other [[Squatting (Australian history)|squatters]] took the opportunity of purchasing and droving herds of livestock to the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] region where they could occupy supposedly vacant crown land. They were guided by an ex-convict in [[Richard Craig (adventurer)|Richard Craig]] who had previously lived with the [[Gumbaynggirr]] and [[Bundjalung people]] in this area after he escaped from the [[Moreton Bay penal settlement]]. Initially Coutts set up a [[sheep station]] called Bald Hills in the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region which was at the start of the track down to the Clarence River valley. Coutts Water which was part of his Bald Hills property, is a waterway that still bears his name and is now a popular trout fishing site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coutts Water |url=https://mapio.net/pic/p-37539788/ |website=mapio |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1840, Coutts, led by Richard Craig, brought around two thousand head of sheep and cattle down the track from Bald Hills to the Clarence River valley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476493 |title=Thomas Courts|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref> He laid claim to a region of open and lightly wooded country south of the river and named this leasehold Kangaroo Creek. The region was of course already occupied by [[Aboriginal Australians]] and Coutts proceeded to take ownership of the land forcibly from the original inhabitants. In response, the local Gumbaynggirr people killed Coutts' cattle and sheep and also killed several of Coutts' stockmen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article193844192 |title=Clarence River Historical Society |newspaper=[[Daily Examiner]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=3 July 1937 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref> Detachments of [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] occassionally massacred local Aboriginal people in punitive expeditions in order to protect the local British squatters, but small scale Aboriginal resistance around Kangaroo Creek continued throughout the 1840s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28651627 |title=Domestic Intelligence|newspaper=[[The Sydney Herald]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 July 1841 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n==Mass poisoning at Kangaroo Creek==\nIn late November 1847, Coutts invited the Aboriginal people living around Kangaroo Creek to come to his homestead for the possibility of obtaining work. Coutts had previously not allowed any groups of Aboriginal people near his homestead and was widely known to have expressed the opinion that native people \"deserved shooting\".{{cite quote|date=April 2020}} Around 23 people accepted the offer and Coutts put them to work weeding areas close to the homestead. After the work was completed, Coutts gave them a 10 pound bag of flour. Coutts was observed to have put the powdery contents of a paper sachet, believed to have been [[arsenic]], into the bag of flour before giving it to the group of Gumbaynggirr. The unsuspecting people took the bag of poisoned flour from Coutts and proceeded to a communal area in the hills between Kangaroo and Towallum Creeks. Here, they made damper from the flour and ate it.<ref name=\"lydon\" >{{Citation | author1=Lydon, Jane | title='no moral doubt...' : Aboriginal evidence and the Kangaroo Creek poisoning, 1847\u20131849 | publication-date=1996 | url=https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p72561/pdf/article0714.pdf | accessdate=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476489 |title=Poisoned Blacks|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, several reports emerged of a large number of Aboriginal people becoming violently ill and dying in the hills behind Kangaroo Creek. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Oliver Fry, heard these reports from both white and black sources, and came to investigate. In January 1848, Fry visited the site and found the decomposing bodies of at least 23 people. He collected evidence including remnants of the damper that remained, and immediately arrested and charged Coutts for the crime. Local magistrates concluded Coutts should stand trial for wilful murder and he was transported to Sydney to be tried at the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\nOn 23 February, Coutts appeared before judge [[Alfred Stephen]] and was given bail on \u00a31,000 worth of sureties. The case was delayed and on 10 May 1848, the Attorney General, [[John Plunkett]], decided not to proceed with the case. Plunkett did this even though he had a very strong suspicion of Coutts' guilt and was aware that justice was being \"entirely evaded\" by this decision. Coutts was subsequently discharged and returned to Kangaroo Creek.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\n==Moving northwards==\nDuring his time at Sydney, one of Coutts' hutkeepers at Kangaroo Creek was killed by local Gumbaynggirr in an apparent revenge attack. Coutts quickly sold out of his Kangaroo Creek holdings and in 1850 he took up the [[Tooloom Creek|Tooloom]] property in the ranges about 100km to the north of [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]]. He also invested in a steamer named the ''Raven'' which provided a river transport service between [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. In 1851, Coutts looked to gain further property by taking a large flock of sheep further north to squat on land near to [[Camboon, Queensland|Camboon]] on the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson River]]. This region was being strongly defended from British colonisation by the resident [[Yiman people]] who killed several of Coutts' shepherds and speared to death Alexander \"Sandy\" Ross, who was a squatter accompanying Coutts in his attempt to set up a property. Due to the resistance of the Yiman, Coutts was forced to abandon the Dawson River and returned to Tooloom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article677024 |title=Central Criminal Court|newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=6 December 1851 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref> A few years later, he bought the [[Ellangowan, Queensland|Ellangowan]] property near [[Toowoomba]].

He is best known for perpetrating a [[mass poisonings of Aboriginal Australians|mass poisoning]] of [[Aboriginal Australians]] on a property near the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in the [[Northern Rivers]] area of [[New South Wales]], which killed at least 23 people. Although Coutts was arrested for this crime, the judicial authorities never put the case to trial and he was released after the payment of bail. Coutts afterwards became a prosperous and respected colonial figure. The town of [[Coutts Crossing, New South Wales|Coutts Crossing]] is named after him.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Coutts was born in [[Glenmuick]], [[Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]] on 11 December 1797. His parents were James and Elizabeth Coutts.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Gordon Family Tree |url=https://sites.rootsweb.com/~gordon/gordonfam/pafg43.htm#1345 |website=Rootsweb |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> He emigrated with two of his brothers to the British colony of New South Wales around 1817. He settled in Sydney and it appears that Coutts chose to follow a seafaring vocation. By the 1830s he became a [[master mariner]], taking the title of Captain Thomas Coutts.<ref name=\"couttsclan\">{{cite web |last1=Coutts |first1=Malcolm |title=Capt Thomas & Rev James |url=https://clancoutts.ning.com/page/capt-thomas-rev-james |website=Clan Coutts Society |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Whaling==\nIn 1832, Coutts and his brothers built a 90 tonne [[brig]] on the banks of the [[Georges River]]. They named the vessel the ''Lady Leith'' and Thomas Coutts was registered as both the owner and master of the brig. Initially the ''Lady Leith'' was utilised to transport cargo from Sydney to [[Hobart]] but soon was trading in sugar between [[Mauritius]] and Australia. It seems this wasn't a profitable trade as Coutts quickly switched to using his vessel as a whaler.<ref name=\"couttsclan\" /> From the mid 1830s until 1840, Coutts captained the ''Lady Leith'' in regular voyages to the whaling grounds off New Zealand, returning with cargoes of [[sperm whale]] oil for sale in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31722620 |title=Projected Departures|newspaper=[[The Colonist]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 February 1839 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref> During this period, Coutts married Maria Bloodworth in 1834 and bought a house in O'Connell Street in Sydney.<ref name=\"couttsfam\">{{cite web |title=Thomas Coutts |url=http://www.whosyerdad-e.com/families-w/individual.php?pid=I2292&ged=white.ged |website=whosyerdad-e |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Pastoral farming==\nIn early 1840, Coutts placed the ''Lady Leith'' up for sale and started to invest in [[pastoral farming]]. He and several other [[Squatting (Australian history)|squatters]] took the opportunity of purchasing and droving herds of livestock to the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] region where they could occupy supposedly vacant crown land. They were guided by an ex-convict in [[Richard Craig (adventurer)|Richard Craig]] who had previously lived with the [[Gumbaynggirr]] and [[Bundjalung people]] in this area after he escaped from the [[Moreton Bay penal settlement]]. Initially Coutts set up a [[sheep station]] called Bald Hills in the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region which was at the start of the track down to the Clarence River valley. Coutts Water which was part of his Bald Hills property, is a waterway that still bears his name and is now a popular trout fishing site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coutts Water |url=https://mapio.net/pic/p-37539788/ |website=mapio |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1840, Coutts, led by Richard Craig, brought around two thousand head of sheep and cattle down the track from Bald Hills to the Clarence River valley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476493 |title=Thomas Courts|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref> He laid claim to a region of open and lightly wooded country south of the river and named this leasehold Kangaroo Creek. The region was of course already occupied by [[Aboriginal Australians]] and Coutts proceeded to take ownership of the land forcibly from the original inhabitants. In response, the local Gumbaynggirr people killed Coutts' cattle and sheep and also killed several of Coutts' stockmen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article193844192 |title=Clarence River Historical Society |newspaper=[[Daily Examiner]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=3 July 1937 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref> Detachments of [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] occassionally massacred local Aboriginal people in punitive expeditions in order to protect the local British squatters, but small scale Aboriginal resistance around Kangaroo Creek continued throughout the 1840s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28651627 |title=Domestic Intelligence|newspaper=[[The Sydney Herald]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 July 1841 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n==Mass poisoning at Kangaroo Creek==\nIn late November 1847, Coutts invited the Aboriginal people living around Kangaroo Creek to come to his homestead for the possibility of obtaining work. Coutts had previously not allowed any groups of Aboriginal people near his homestead and was widely known to have expressed the opinion that native people \"deserved shooting\".{{cite quote|date=April 2020}} Around 23 people accepted the offer and Coutts put them to work weeding areas close to the homestead. After the work was completed, Coutts gave them a 10 pound bag of flour. Coutts was observed to have put the powdery contents of a paper sachet, believed to have been [[arsenic]], into the bag of flour before giving it to the group of Gumbaynggirr. The unsuspecting people took the bag of poisoned flour from Coutts and proceeded to a communal area in the hills between Kangaroo and Towallum Creeks. Here, they made damper from the flour and ate it.<ref name=\"lydon\" >{{Citation | author1=Lydon, Jane | title='no moral doubt...' : Aboriginal evidence and the Kangaroo Creek poisoning, 1847\u20131849 | publication-date=1996 | url=https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p72561/pdf/article0714.pdf | accessdate=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476489 |title=Poisoned Blacks|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, several reports emerged of a large number of Aboriginal people becoming violently ill and dying in the hills behind Kangaroo Creek. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Oliver Fry, heard these reports from both white and black sources, and came to investigate. In January 1848, Fry visited the site and found the decomposing bodies of at least 23 people. He collected evidence including remnants of the damper that remained, and immediately arrested and charged Coutts for the crime. Local magistrates concluded Coutts should stand trial for wilful murder and he was transported to Sydney to be tried at the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\nOn 23 February, Coutts appeared before judge [[Alfred Stephen]] and was given bail on \u00a31,000 worth of sureties.

Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation, for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.\n\nAs the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the D\u00e1il in the next general election. The nominating bodies tend to nominate party members.

The broad requirements are specified by Article 18 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] and the implementation details by [[Acts of the Oireachtas]], principally the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947, and associated [[statutory instrument]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commencement, Amendments, SIs made under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/isbc/1947_42.html |website=Irish Statute Book |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Interests and services, and subpanels==\nArticle 18.7.1\u00b0 of the Constitution defines the five panels and specifies that each shall elect between five and eleven senators.

Candidates can be nominated by two methods: by Oireachtas members or by nominating bodies. Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation, for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.\n\nAs the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the D\u00e1il in the next general election. The nominating bodies tend to nominate party members. Even where non-party candidates get on the ballot paper, it is very rare that these candidates are successful.\n\n===<!-- [[Completion of panels]] redirects here-->Completion of panels===\nThe minimum number of nominees for each subpanel is two plus the maximum number to be elected from the subpanel.

The village was a part of the Zelenohorsk\u00e9 and then a plan estate, owned by the \u0160ternberks and later Martinice. No information is known about the establishment of the village, but it is likely to be related to the operation of the Cistercian monastery under Zelena Hora.\n\nThe name Lou\u017en\u00e1 means a floodplain village (ie a village lying near a puddle, \"l\u00fa\u017e\u011b\"). Old Czech dictionaries do not accurately reflect the word \"l\u00fa\u017e\u011b\", but it seems that the word also referred to a slightly larger water surface than the word puddle, pool. In the past, the name of the village was recorded in the form: Lauzna, Lauc\u017ena or Lauschna.\n\nThe village has two parts: Stankovy (no. 28 to the north) and Lou\u017en\u00e1 (no. 11 to the south). On the map of the first military survey from the 1860s the village is captured without the later part of Stankovy. At that time, the individual houses were situated practically only around a relatively large village square, on which a large cross was drawn, which preceded the local chapel, and a small pond. Part of Stankovy began to be built in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAt present, Lou\u017en\u00e1 is an integrated municipality of Mysl\u00edv, including the Mysl\u00edv parish.\n\n=== Chapel of the Virgin Mary Queen ===\nThe chapel on the village square in Lou\u017en\u00e1 was built in 1920. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary Queen and the pilgrimage is celebrated here on the first Sunday after 24 August. It's rectangular in shape, the roof is covered with tiles. In the 1970s a major repair of the interior of the chapel was made and was plastered from the outside. In 2009 - 2010 the chapel acquired a new roof and a copper bell tower. In front of the chapel stands a monument to the fallen soldiers of the I. and II.

It is also a cadastral territory with an area of 3.59&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\n== History ==\nThe first written mention of the village dates back to 1558<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.obecmysliv.cz/cs/historie-a-pamatky-obce-louzna|title=Historie a pam\u00e1tky obce Lou\u017en\u00e1 {{!}} Obec Mysl\u00edv|website=www.obecmysliv.cz|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> when the village named Lou\u017en\u00e1 is listed in the property of Adam of Sternberg. The village was a part of the Zelenohorsk\u00e9 and then a plan estate, owned by the \u0160ternberks and later Martinice. No information is known about the establishment of the village, but it is likely to be related to the operation of the Cistercian monastery under Zelena Hora.\n\nThe name Lou\u017en\u00e1 means a floodplain village (ie a village lying near a puddle, \"l\u00fa\u017e\u011b\"). Old Czech dictionaries do not accurately reflect the word \"l\u00fa\u017e\u011b\", but it seems that the word also referred to a slightly larger water surface than the word puddle, pool. In the past, the name of the village was recorded in the form: Lauzna, Lauc\u017ena or Lauschna.\n\nThe village has two parts: Stankovy (no. 28 to the north) and Lou\u017en\u00e1 (no. 11 to the south). On the map of the first military survey from the 1860s the village is captured without the later part of Stankovy. At that time, the individual houses were situated practically only around a relatively large village square, on which a large cross was drawn, which preceded the local chapel, and a small pond. Part of Stankovy began to be built in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAt present, Lou\u017en\u00e1 is an integrated municipality of Mysl\u00edv, including the Mysl\u00edv parish.\n\n=== Chapel of the Virgin Mary Queen ===\nThe chapel on the village square in Lou\u017en\u00e1 was built in 1920. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary Queen and the pilgrimage is celebrated here on the first Sunday after 24 August. It's rectangular in shape, the roof is covered with tiles. In the 1970s a major repair of the interior of the chapel was made and was plastered from the outside. In 2009 - 2010 the chapel acquired a new roof and a copper bell tower. In front of the chapel stands a monument to the fallen soldiers of the I. and II.

Daeida learned of the name Hollywood from Ivar Weid, her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now [[Lake Hollywood]]) and a prominent L.A. investor.\n\nIn August of 1887 at the age of 25, she and her husband began to lay out a new town on their ranch, with a subdivision map filed for \"Hollywood, California,\" with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. Her efforts to expand her personal Utopia relied on hiring Chinese and Mexican workers, but never allowing them to purchase or own land. H H Wilcox was a realtor who sold land.  Unfortunately he died before he developed anything.  Their ranch, purchased at $150 an acre, was sold for $1,000 a lot. The 1880s real-estate boom busted that same year, yet Hollywood began its slow growth.\n\nHarvey Wilcox died in 1891. In 1894, Daeida married Philo J. Beveridge, a businessman and prominent citizen of Hollywood and son of an Illinois governor, who shared her vision of community. The Beveridges had four children <ref name=\"hicks\">[http://www.hicksvillehistoricalsociety.org/Daeida%20Beveridge.htm Hicksville Historical Society\u2014''Daeida Beveridge'']</ref>\n\nWith her second husband, Daeida continued leading development efforts and was instrumental in establishing much of Hollywood's civic infrastructure, including the city hall, library, police station, primary school, tennis club, post office, city park, and one of the two original commercial districts.<ref name=\"hicks\"/> She built the Hollywood National Bank and Citizen's Savings Bank, a post office, a theatrical playhouse, and the city's first sidewalks. For cultural enhancement, she also donated land for three churches, and her own residence's 3 prime lots on [[Cahuenga Boulevard]] and Prospect (Hollywood Boulevard) to the painter [[Paul de Longpr\u00e9]], for an estate including extensive flower gardens, and a [[Mission Revival architecture|Mission Revival style]] mansion with a public art gallery. It became one of the most popular tourist attractions.\n\nShe came to be called the \"Mother of Hollywood.\" Daeida Wilcox Beveridge died on 7 August 1914.<ref name=\"hicks\"/>\n\nThe ''Los Angeles Times'' obituary stated that it was Daeida's dream of beauty that gave world fame to Hollywood, years before the first movie company arrived in 1913. Her associates had only kind words for her, \"reliable, forcible, kindly, a woman of rare judgment, and a worthy opponent.\"<ref name=\"hicks\"/>\n\nDaeida Hartell Wilcox Beveridge was inducted into the Ohio Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1995.<ref>[http://www.odjfs.state.oh.us/women/halloffame/bio.asp?ID=15  Ohio Women\u2019s Hall of Fame: Daeida Hartell Wilcox Beveridge]</ref>\n\n==Namesakes==\n*Wilcox Avenue \u2014 a north/south street, 1 block west of [[Cahuenga Boulevard]] in Hollywood and [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles]].\n*Wilcox Post Office\u2014[[United States Post Office (Hollywood, California)|Hollywood Station (United States Post Office, Hollywood, California)]].\n*Wilcox Police Station\u2014Hollywood Community Police Station.\n*Daeida Magazine \u2014 [http://www.daeida.com/Daeida_History_2.html Daeida.com: Daeida Magazine.com: ''Hollywood's People, Passions, and Its Past'']\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Hollywood history and culture|Hollywood history and culture]]\n*[[Rancho La Brea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hicksvillehistoricalsociety.org/Daeida%20Beveridge.htm Hicksville Historical Society: Daeida Hartle Wilcox Beveridge]\n* {{Find a Grave|2062}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilcox, Daeida}}\n[[Category:American city founders]]\n[[Category:American women in business]]\n[[Category:Hollywood history and culture]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Land owners from California]]\n[[Category:People from Hollywood, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:People from Hicksville, Ohio]]\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1914 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]\n", "name_user": "ChristianMChristian", "label": "safe", "comment": "1.
