Dio called him Flavius Arrianus Nicomediansis. In respect of his birth date, sources provide similar dates for his birth; within a few years prior to 90, 89, and 85\u201390 AD. The line of reasoning for dates belonging to 85-90 AD is from the fact of Arrian being made a [[consul]] around 130 AD, and the usual age for this, during this period, being forty-two years of age. (ref. p.&nbsp;312, & SYME 1958, ''same page''). His family was from the Greek provincial aristocracy, and his full name, ''L. Flavius Arrianus'', indicates that he was a Roman citizen, suggesting that the citizenship went back several generations, probably to the time of the Roman conquest some 170 years before.<ref name=\"origin\" /><ref name=\"Le Clerc, Jean, Rooke, John\">{{cite book |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433081553301;view=1up;seq=1|authors=Le Clerc, Jean, Rooke, John|title=Arrian's History of Alexander's expedition.

The line of reasoning for dates belonging to 85-90 AD is from the fact of Arrian being made a [[consul]] around 130 AD, and the usual age for this, during this period, being forty-two years of age. (ref. p.&nbsp;312, & SYME 1958, ''same page''). His family was from the Greek provincial aristocracy, and his full name, ''L.

It was awarded to four officers during World War II, and has not been authorized since.  However, the rank of fleet admiral of the United States Navy still remains listed on official rank insignia precedence charts and, if needed, this rank could be reestablished at the discretion of Congress and the President.  All five-star officers are, technically, unable to retire from active duty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Law 333, 79TH CONG., CHS. 109, 110, 112, MAR. 22, 23, 1946|url=http://legisworks.org/congress/79/publaw-333.pdf|publisher=LegisWorks.org|accessdate=15 September 2016|quote=\"This law in 1946 provided that each of the 8 Five-Star officers at the end of WWII was permanently appointed as O-11, and whether retired or not would continue to draw full pay and allowances for the rest of their life, as if on active duty.

No provisions were made for these officers' successors to have the same benefits; only one more O-11 was appointed, General Omar Bradley was appointed in 1950 as General of the Army, and his benefits followed the model of PL 333.  The grade of O-11 itself was temporary in that while Congress provided for appointments to serve in it, once the last appointed officer (Bradley d. 1982) died, there have been no further appointments to O-11.}}</ref>  The last living fleet admiral of the United States Navy, [[Chester W. Nimitz]], died in 1966.\n\n==Rank and promotion system==\nIn the event that officers demonstrate superior performance and prove themselves capable of performing at the next higher pay grade, they are given an increase in pay grade.  The official term for this process is a [[promotion (rank)|promotion]].\n\nCommissioned naval officers originate from the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]], other Service Academies (United States Military Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, or United States Air Force Academy), [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (NROTC), [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), the since-disestablished [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Aviation Officer Candidate School]] (AOCS), and a host of other commissioning programs such as the \"Seaman to Admiral-21\" program and the [[limited duty officer]]/[[chief warrant officer]] (LDO/CWO) selection program.  There are also a small number of [[Direct commission officer|direct commissioned officers]], primarily staff corps officers in the medical, dental, nurse, chaplain and judge advocate general career fields.\n\nCommissioned officers can generally be divided into line officers and staff corps:\n\n*[[Line officer]]s (or ''officers of the line'') derive their name from the 18th-century tactic of employing [[warship]]s in a line of battle to take advantage of [[cannon]] on each side of the ship. These vessels were dubbed [[ships of the line]] and those who commanded them were likewise called \"line officers.\"  Today, all United States Navy unrestricted line and restricted line officers denote their status with a star located above their rank insignia on the sleeves of their dress blue uniforms and shoulder boards of their white uniforms; metal rank insignia devices on both collar-points of khaki shirts/blouses; and cloth equivalents on both collar-points of blue NWUs.  Officers of the staff corps replace the star (or the left collar-point on applicable shirts/blouses) with different insignias to indicate their field of specialty.<ref>[http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ranks/officers/specialty-staff/spclstaff.html \"Specialty Insignia - Staff Corps\"].</ref>  Line officers can be categorized into unrestricted and restricted communities.\n**[[Unrestricted Line Officer|Unrestricted line officer]]s (URL) are the most visible and well-known of line officers, due to their role as the Navy's war-fighting [[command element]].  They receive training in weapons systems, tactics, strategy, [[command and control]], and are considered unrestricted because they are authorized to command combatant ships, combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings, and [[special operations]] units at sea, or combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings or special operations units deployed ashore.  URL officers are [[Naval Aviator]]s (and Naval Aviator-[[Astronaut]]s), [[Naval Flight Officer]]s (and Naval Flight Officer-Astronauts), [[Surface Warfare Officer]]s, [[Submarine Warfare insignia|Submarine Warfare Officer]]s, [[United States Navy SEALs|Special Warfare Officer]]s (e.g., Sea-Air-Land, or [[SEAL]] Officers), and Special Operations/Explosive Ordnance Disposal ([[Explosive ordnance disposal|EOD]]) Officers.\n**[[Restricted Line Officer|Restricted line officer]]s (RL) concentrate on non-combat related fields, which include [[Marine propulsion|marine engineering]], [[aeronautical engineering]], ship [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], aircraft [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]], [[naval intelligence]], information technology, manpower/human resources, public affairs, and a host of other career fields.  They are not qualified to command combat units, but can command organizations in their respective specialized career fields.  In certain shipboard environments, many unrestricted line officers fill what might be considered restricted line duties, such as the officers in a ship's or submarine's [[Engine department (ship)|engineering department]].  Because they maintain their general surface warfare or submarine warfare specialist duties instead of completely specializing in one career area, they maintain their unrestricted line command career path.\n*[[List of United States Navy staff corps|Staff corps]] officers are specialists in fields that are themselves professional careers and not exclusive to the military, for example [[health care]], [[law]], [[civil engineering]] and [[religion]].  There are eight staff corps:  [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|Medical Corps]], [[Navy Dental Corps|Dental Corps]], [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Nurse Corps]], [[Navy Medical Service Corps|Medical Service Corps]], [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Chaplain Corps]], [[Navy Supply Corps (United States)|Navy Supply Corps]], [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|Judge Advocate General's Corps]], and [[Civil Engineer Corps]].  They primarily exist to augment the line communities and are able to be assigned to both line and staff commands.  One exception to this is the case of Civil Engineer Corps officers, who serve as the both Public Works Officers and Resident Officers in Charge of Construction (ROICC) at naval shore installations, and as officers for Construction Battalion ([[Seabee]]) units.  This latter role requires them to serve in a command capacity for ground combatants when the Seabees are deployed to combat areas.\n\nNote 2:  See also [[Commodore (United States)]] \u2014 today an honorific title (but not a pay grade) for selected URL captains (O-6) in major command of multiple subordinate operational units, and formerly a rank (O-7).<ref>[[14 USC 271]]: Promotions; appointments ('''1985'''\u2014Pub.

It was awarded to four officers during World War II, and has not been authorized since.  However, the rank of fleet admiral of the United States Navy still remains listed on official rank insignia precedence charts and, if needed, this rank could be reestablished at the discretion of Congress and the President.  All five-star officers are, technically, unable to retire from active duty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Law 333, 79TH CONG., CHS. 109, 110, 112, MAR. 22, 23, 1946|url=http://legisworks.org/congress/79/publaw-333.pdf|publisher=LegisWorks.org|accessdate=15 September 2016|quote=\"This law in 1946 provided that each of the 8 Five-Star officers at the end of WWII was permanently appointed as O-11, and whether retired or not would continue to draw full pay and allowances for the rest of their life, as if on active duty.  The same benefit was provided for the serving Commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard (both O-10, 4-star General and Admiral, respectively), who were in office on 14 August 1945.  No provisions were made for these officers' successors to have the same benefits; only one more O-11 was appointed, General Omar Bradley was appointed in 1950 as General of the Army, and his benefits followed the model of PL 333.  The grade of O-11 itself was temporary in that while Congress provided for appointments to serve in it, once the last appointed officer (Bradley d. 1982) died, there have been no further appointments to O-11.}}</ref>  The last living fleet admiral of the United States Navy, [[Chester W. Nimitz]], died in 1966.\n\n==Rank and promotion system==\nIn the event that officers demonstrate superior performance and prove themselves capable of performing at the next higher pay grade, they are given an increase in pay grade.  The official term for this process is a [[promotion (rank)|promotion]].\n\nCommissioned naval officers originate from the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]], other Service Academies (United States Military Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, or United States Air Force Academy), [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (NROTC), [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), the since-disestablished [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Aviation Officer Candidate School]] (AOCS), and a host of other commissioning programs such as the \"Seaman to Admiral-21\" program and the [[limited duty officer]]/[[chief warrant officer]] (LDO/CWO) selection program.  There are also a small number of [[Direct commission officer|direct commissioned officers]], primarily staff corps officers in the medical, dental, nurse, chaplain and judge advocate general career fields.\n\nCommissioned officers can generally be divided into line officers and staff corps:\n\n*[[Line officer]]s (or ''officers of the line'') derive their name from the 18th-century tactic of employing [[warship]]s in a line of battle to take advantage of [[cannon]] on each side of the ship. These vessels were dubbed [[ships of the line]] and those who commanded them were likewise called \"line officers.\"  Today, all United States Navy unrestricted line and restricted line officers denote their status with a star located above their rank insignia on the sleeves of their dress blue uniforms and shoulder boards of their white uniforms; metal rank insignia devices on both collar-points of khaki shirts/blouses; and cloth equivalents on both collar-points of blue NWUs.  Officers of the staff corps replace the star (or the left collar-point on applicable shirts/blouses) with different insignias to indicate their field of specialty.<ref>[http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ranks/officers/specialty-staff/spclstaff.html \"Specialty Insignia - Staff Corps\"].</ref>  Line officers can be categorized into unrestricted and restricted communities.\n**[[Unrestricted Line Officer|Unrestricted line officer]]s (URL) are the most visible and well-known of line officers, due to their role as the Navy's war-fighting [[command element]].  They receive training in weapons systems, tactics, strategy, [[command and control]], and are considered unrestricted because they are authorized to command combatant ships, combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings, and [[special operations]] units at sea, or combat aviation squadrons/air groups/air wings or special operations units deployed ashore.  URL officers are [[Naval Aviator]]s (and Naval Aviator-[[Astronaut]]s), [[Naval Flight Officer]]s (and Naval Flight Officer-Astronauts), [[Surface Warfare Officer]]s, [[Submarine Warfare insignia|Submarine Warfare Officer]]s, [[United States Navy SEALs|Special Warfare Officer]]s (e.g., Sea-Air-Land, or [[SEAL]] Officers), and Special Operations/Explosive Ordnance Disposal ([[Explosive ordnance disposal|EOD]]) Officers.\n**[[Restricted Line Officer|Restricted line officer]]s (RL) concentrate on non-combat related fields, which include [[Marine propulsion|marine engineering]], [[aeronautical engineering]], ship [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], aircraft [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]], [[naval intelligence]], information technology, manpower/human resources, public affairs, and a host of other career fields.  They are not qualified to command combat units, but can command organizations in their respective specialized career fields.  In certain shipboard environments, many unrestricted line officers fill what might be considered restricted line duties, such as the officers in a ship's or submarine's [[Engine department (ship)|engineering department]].  Because they maintain their general surface warfare or submarine warfare specialist duties instead of completely specializing in one career area, they maintain their unrestricted line command career path.\n*[[List of United States Navy staff corps|Staff corps]] officers are specialists in fields that are themselves professional careers and not exclusive to the military, for example [[health care]], [[law]], [[civil engineering]] and [[religion]].  There are eight staff corps:  [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|Medical Corps]], [[Navy Dental Corps|Dental Corps]], [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Nurse Corps]], [[Navy Medical Service Corps|Medical Service Corps]], [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Chaplain Corps]], [[Navy Supply Corps (United States)|Navy Supply Corps]], [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|Judge Advocate General's Corps]], and [[Civil Engineer Corps]].  They primarily exist to augment the line communities and are able to be assigned to both line and staff commands.  One exception to this is the case of Civil Engineer Corps officers, who serve as the both Public Works Officers and Resident Officers in Charge of Construction (ROICC) at naval shore installations, and as officers for Construction Battalion ([[Seabee]]) units.  This latter role requires them to serve in a command capacity for ground combatants when the Seabees are deployed to combat areas.\n\nNote 2:  See also [[Commodore (United States)]] \u2014 today an honorific title (but not a pay grade) for selected URL captains (O-6) in major command of multiple subordinate operational units, and formerly a rank (O-7).<ref>[[14 USC 271]]: Promotions; appointments ('''1985'''\u2014Pub.

It was developed for the [[United States Navy]] (USN).\n\nThe P-8 is being operated in the [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW), [[anti-surface warfare]] (ASUW), and [[blockade|shipping interdiction]] roles. It is armed with [[torpedo]]es, [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon anti-ship missiles]] and other weapons, and is able to drop and monitor [[sonobuoy]]s, as well as operate in conjunction with other assets, including the [[Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton]] maritime surveillance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV).\n\nThe P-8 is operated by the United States Navy, the [[Indian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and the UK's [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).  It has also been ordered by the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] (RNoAF), the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF), and the [[Republic of Korea Navy]] (ROKN). \n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]], a turboprop ASW aircraft, has been in service with the United States Navy (USN) since 1962.<ref name='USNavyFactFile'>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&tid=1400&ct=1 \"P-3C Orion long range ASW aircraft.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155749/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&tid=1400&ct=1 |date=16 March 2011}} ''Navy.mil,'' 18 February 2009.</ref> In the 1980s, the USN began studies for a P-3 replacement, the range and endurance of which were reduced due to increasing weight and airframe fatigue life limitations. The specification required a new aircraft to have reduced operating and support costs. In 1989, Lockheed was awarded a fixed-price contract to develop the [[Lockheed P-7|P-7]], but this was canceled the following year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=John |title=Lockheed loses to Survive |volume=138 |number=4227 |work=[[Flight International]] |date=1\u20137 August 1990 |location=Sutton, Surrey, England |publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Business Publishing Group]] |issn=0015-3710 |pages=20\u201321 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202126.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213054153/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202126.html |archive-date=13 February 2015 |url-status=live}} {{cite news |title=page 21 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202127.html |access-date=27 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213063624/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202127.html |archive-date=13 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> A second competition for a replacement began in 2000.

It was developed for the [[United States Navy]] (USN).\n\nThe P-8 is being operated in the [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW), [[anti-surface warfare]] (ASUW), and [[blockade|shipping interdiction]] roles. It is armed with [[torpedo]]es, [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon anti-ship missiles]] and other weapons, and is able to drop and monitor [[sonobuoy]]s, as well as operate in conjunction with other assets, including the [[Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton]] maritime surveillance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV).\n\nThe P-8 is operated by the United States Navy, the [[Indian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and the UK's [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).

The specification required a new aircraft to have reduced operating and support costs. In 1989, Lockheed was awarded a fixed-price contract to develop the [[Lockheed P-7|P-7]], but this was canceled the following year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=John |title=Lockheed loses to Survive |volume=138 |number=4227 |work=[[Flight International]] |date=1\u20137 August 1990 |location=Sutton, Surrey, England |publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Business Publishing Group]] |issn=0015-3710 |pages=20\u201321 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202126.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213054153/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202126.html |archive-date=13 February 2015 |url-status=live}} {{cite news |title=page 21 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202127.html |access-date=27 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213063624/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202127.html |archive-date=13 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> A second competition for a replacement began in 2000.

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]].

Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waitings.<ref>Jokinen, Anniina. \"[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]\" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws.

She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I

[[Annulment]]s declare that a true marriage never took place, unlike a divorce, in which a married couple end their union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Anne Boleyn served Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour served both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard served Anne of Cleves.\n\n==Catherine of Aragon==\n{{Main|Catherine of Aragon}}\n[[File:Catalina de Arag\u00f3n, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|right|thumb|Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Catherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Arag\u00f3n}}) was Henry's first wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-16858-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 48] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  In modern sources her name is most commonly spelled ''Catherine'', although she spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was an accepted spelling in England at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}</ref> After the death in 1502 of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until he came to the throne in 1509. Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.<ref>Jokinen, Anniina. \"[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]\" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref>\n\n==Catherine Parr==\n{{Main|Catherine Parr}}\n[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]\n[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543\u20131547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables</ref> through more than one ancestor.<ref>{{cite

Photographer [[Lee Miller]] made her only film appearance in this movie, which features an appearance by the famed [[acrobatics|aerialist]] [[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]].<ref name = observer>{{cite news\n  | last = Liner\n  | first = Elaine\n  | title = Swingers: ''Barbette'' soars to greatness with the tragic tale of a trapeze artist\n  | work = Dallas Observer\n  | date = 2002-06-13\n  | url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-06-13/culture/swingers/\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}</ref> It is the first part of [[the Orphic Trilogy]], which is continued in ''[[Orph\u00e9e]]'' (1950) and concludes with ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960).\n\n==Plot==\n''The Blood of a Poet'' is divided into four sections. In section one, an artist sketches a face and is startled when its mouth starts moving. He rubs out the mouth, only to discover that it has transferred to the palm of his hand. After experimenting with the hand for a while and falling asleep, the artist awakens and places the mouth over the mouth of a female statue.\n\nIn section two, the statue speaks to the artist, cajoling him into passing through a mirror. The mirror transports the artist to a hotel, where he peers through several keyholes, witnessing such people as an [[opium]] smoker and a [[hermaphrodite]]. The artist is handed a gun and a disembodied voice instructs him how to shoot himself in the head. He shoots himself but does not die. The artist cries out that he has seen enough and returns through the mirror. He smashes the statue with a mallet.\n\nIn section three, some students are having a snowball fight. An older boy throws a snowball at a younger boy, but the snowball turns out to be a chunk of marble. The young boy dies from the impact.\n\nIn the final section, a card shark plays a game with a woman on a table set up over the body of the dead boy. A theatre party looks on. The card shark extracts an Ace of Hearts from the dead boy's breast pocket. The boy's [[guardian angel]] appears and absorbs the dead boy. He also removes the Ace of Hearts from the card shark's hand and retreats up a flight of stairs and through a door. Realizing he has lost, the card shark commits suicide as the theatre party applauds. A female player transforms into the formerly smashed statue and walks off through the snow, leaving no footprints. In the film's final moments the statue is shown with an [[ox]], a [[globe]], and a [[lyre]].\n\nIntercut through the film, [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] images appear, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Enrique Riveros]] as the Poet\n*[[Elizabeth Lee Miller]] as the Statue\n*[[Pauline Carton]] as the Instructor of Children\n*[[Odette Talazac]] as Audience Member\n*[[Jean Desbordes]] as Louis XV Friend\n*[[Fernand Dichamps]] as Audience Member\n*[[Lucien Jager]] as Audience Member\n*[[F\u00e9ral Benga]] as the Guardian Angel\n*[[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]]\n\n==Production and film==\n''The Blood of a Poet'' was one of the first [[narrative film]]s and still made use of written text such as the opening words: \"Every poem is a coat of arms. It must be deciphered.\" The film is considered, along with ''[[L'Age d'Or|The Golden Age]]'' (1930), one of two [[French cinema|French films]] released at the end of this first phase of avant garde film-making that continues to develop the model presented by ''[[Chien Andalou]]'':<ref name=oxford96>{{cite book |last1=Nowell-Smith |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Oxford History of World Cinema |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofw00geof/page/100 100] |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofw00geof |url-access=registration |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|quote=...elements of narrative and acting arouse the spectator's psychological participation in plot or scene while at the same time distancing the viewer by disallowing empathy, meaning and closure; an image of the disassociated sensibility or 'double consciousness' praised by [[Surrealism]] in its critique of naturalism|width=75%|source=The Oxford History of World Cinema}}\n\nThe film is a blend of Cocteau's classical aesthetics and the [[Baroque]] stylings of Surrealism. Cocteau's voice [[satirically]] explores his character's obsession with fame and death: \"Those who smash statues should beware of becoming one\". Dissolution of personal identity is presented in contrast with Western emphasis on stability and repetition.<ref name=oxford06 />  \n\n''The Blood of a Poet'' was funded by Charles, Vicomte de Noailles, who gave Cocteau 1,000,000 francs to make it. Cocteau invited the Vicomte and his wife [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], along with several of their friends, to appear in a scene as a theatre party. In the scene, they talked among themselves and, on cue, began applauding.

Photographer [[Lee Miller]] made her only film appearance in this movie, which features an appearance by the famed [[acrobatics|aerialist]] [[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]].<ref name = observer>{{cite news\n  | last = Liner\n  | first = Elaine\n  | title = Swingers: ''Barbette'' soars to greatness with the tragic tale of a trapeze artist\n  | work = Dallas Observer\n  | date = 2002-06-13\n  | url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-06-13/culture/swingers/\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}</ref> It is the first part of [[the Orphic Trilogy]], which is continued in ''[[Orph\u00e9e]]'' (1950) and concludes with ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1960).\n\n==Plot==\n''The Blood of a Poet'' is divided into four sections. In section one, an artist sketches a face and is startled when its mouth starts moving. He rubs out the mouth, only to discover that it has transferred to the palm of his hand. After experimenting with the hand for a while and falling asleep, the artist awakens and places the mouth over the mouth of a female statue.\n\nIn section two, the statue speaks to the artist, cajoling him into passing through a mirror. The mirror transports the artist to a hotel, where he peers through several keyholes, witnessing such people as an [[opium]] smoker and a [[hermaphrodite]]. The artist is handed a gun and a disembodied voice instructs him how to shoot himself in the head. He shoots himself but does not die. The artist cries out that he has seen enough and returns through the mirror. He smashes the statue with a mallet.\n\nIn section three, some students are having a snowball fight. An older boy throws a snowball at a younger boy, but the snowball turns out to be a chunk of marble. The young boy dies from the impact.\n\nIn the final section, a card shark plays a game with a woman on a table set up over the body of the dead boy. A theatre party looks on. The card shark extracts an Ace of Hearts from the dead boy's breast pocket. The boy's [[guardian angel]] appears and absorbs the dead boy. He also removes the Ace of Hearts from the card shark's hand and retreats up a flight of stairs and through a door. Realizing he has lost, the card shark commits suicide as the theatre party applauds. A female player transforms into the formerly smashed statue and walks off through the snow, leaving no footprints. In the film's final moments the statue is shown with an [[ox]], a [[globe]], and a [[lyre]].\n\nIntercut through the film, [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] images appear, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Enrique Riveros]] as the Poet\n*[[Elizabeth Lee Miller]] as the Statue\n*[[Pauline Carton]] as the Instructor of Children\n*[[Odette Talazac]] as Audience Member\n*[[Jean Desbordes]] as Louis XV Friend\n*[[Fernand Dichamps]] as Audience Member\n*[[Lucien Jager]] as Audience Member\n*[[F\u00e9ral Benga]] as the Guardian Angel\n*[[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]]\n\n==Production and film==\n''The Blood of a Poet'' was one of the first [[narrative film]]s and still made use of written text such as the opening words: \"Every poem is a coat of arms. It must be deciphered.\" The film is considered, along with ''[[L'Age d'Or|The Golden Age]]'' (1930), one of two [[French cinema|French films]] released at the end of this first phase of avant garde film-making that continues to develop the model presented by ''[[Chien Andalou]]'':<ref name=oxford96>{{cite book |last1=Nowell-Smith |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Oxford History of World Cinema |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofw00geof/page/100 100] |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryofw00geof |url-access=registration |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|quote=...elements of narrative and acting arouse the spectator's psychological participation in plot or scene while at the same time distancing the viewer by disallowing empathy, meaning and closure; an image of the disassociated sensibility or 'double consciousness' praised by [[Surrealism]] in its critique of naturalism|width=75%|source=The Oxford History of World Cinema}}\n\nThe film is a blend of Cocteau's classical aesthetics and the [[Baroque]] stylings of Surrealism. Cocteau's voice [[satirically]] explores his character's obsession with fame and death: \"Those who smash statues should beware of becoming one). Dissolution of personal identity is presented in contrast with Western emphasis on stability and repetition.<ref name=oxford06 />  \n\n''The Blood of a Poet'' was funded by Charles, Vicomte de Noailles, who gave Cocteau 1,000,000 francs to make it. Cocteau invited the Vicomte and his wife [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], along with several of their friends, to appear in a scene as a theatre party. In the scene, they talked among themselves and, on cue, began applauding. Upon seeing the completed film, they were horrified to learn that they were applauding a game of cards that ended with a suicide, which had been filmed separately.

Towards the end of the match, Jack [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|broke from the script]] and legitimately shocked Grimes with a [[taser]] before throwing Grimes from the scaffold and sending him crashing to the ring 40 feet below; there were over 12 tables stacked on top of each other in the ring to break the fall, but Grimes missed all but two of them and came within less than a foot of missing the ring completely, which likely would have killed him. Grimes broke his fall on the top rope, dislocating his ankle and suffering multiple other injuries in the process. In the 2005 documentary ''[[Forever Hardcore]]'', New Jack claimed that his intentions were to throw Grimes so hard that he would fall head-first onto the steel turnbuckle and be killed, as retaliation for Grimes's lack of caring after the botched spot in Danbury 18 months before.

For unknown reasons, Joe was continuously [[Sell (professional wrestling)|no-selling]] New Jack, and Joe headbutted him in the nose. New Jack then got angry with Joe and decided to get genuine sells by [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] attacking the 71-year-old man with a chain, a framed picture of his aunt, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, and several other weapons. The crowd, horrified by Jack's savage beating of this man either left the show in disgust or started calling Jack the \"n\" word- a term he had been called almost every week during his days in Smoky Mountain Wresting. In an interview for ''Vice''in 2019, Jack stated \"the more they called me a n****r, the angrier I got and the more I beat the guy (Gypsy Joe) up.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=New Jack attacks Gypsy Joe |url=http://www.wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/newjack_gypsyjoe.html |publisher=Wrestling Gone Wrong |accessdate=2008-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504220538/http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/newjack_gypsyjoe.html |archivedate=2006-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, New Jack, wrestling for Thunder Wrestling Federation, was scheduled to fight fellow wrestler William Jason Lane at an event near [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

It was billed as his last appearance in the Midwest. In January, Jack was eliminated in battle royal by White Mike but went on to defeat Mike in a singles match.

In June 1993, he won his first championship, the [[USWA World Tag Team Championship]] with his partner Homeboy, defeating [[Well Dunn|Simply Devine]] for the titles. They would hold onto the titles for two weeks before losing them to [[C.W.

New Jack returned by the end of 1999 with his eye seemingly recovered, now sporting a scythe around his neck, claiming that he had \"upgraded\" the staple gun.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTheir first encounter was at [[November to Remember (1999)|November to Remember]], where Jack and the Freaks lost to Da Baldies in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]].<ref>{{cite web |first1=John |last1=Powell |title=Glitches mar ECW's N2R |url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/nov8_ecwppv.html |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |accessdate=10 June 2018|work=SLAM!

Grimes was reluctant to take this very risky bump, and New Jack, annoyed with Grimes's reluctance and unprofessionalism dragged Grimes down with him after a count of 3, and Grimes awkwardly fell half a second after Jack instead of falling together in the safest fashion. They fell off the scaffold, missed the tables that were supposed to absorb the force of their fall and landed on the concrete floor, with Grimes landing on New Jack's head.

Jack remained with the promotion which was closed due to bankruptcy a month later in January 2001.\n\n===XPW and the independent circuit (2001\u20132012)===\nAfter ECW declared [[bankruptcy]] in April 2001, New Jack began wrestling on the [[independent circuit]]. In 2001 and 2002, he wrestled for [[XPW]], and in 2003, he made multiple appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and also [[Combat Zone Wrestling]], competing in [[Cage of Death V]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} New Jack appeared at the ECW reunion show, ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'', on June 10, 2005, as well as competing on the \"Extreme Reunion\" tour from September 15\u201316.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nNew Jack came across Grimes again in February 2002 in a scaffold match, and Jack was personally affronted by Grimes's civil behavior towards him to regain Jack's trust because Grimes had not contacted Jack when he was recovering from his injuries after their fall in Danbury 18 months before. Towards the end of the match, Jack [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|broke from the script]] and legitimately shocked Grimes with a [[taser]] before throwing Grimes from the scaffold and sending him crashing to the ring 40 feet below; there were over 12 tables stacked on top of each other in the ring to break the fall, but Grimes missed all but two of them and came within less than a foot of missing the ring completely, which likely would have killed him. Grimes broke his fall on the top rope, dislocating his ankle and suffering multiple other injuries in the process. In the 2005 documentary ''[[Forever Hardcore]]'', New Jack claimed that his intentions were to throw Grimes so hard that he would fall head-first onto the steel turnbuckle and be killed, as retaliation for Grimes's lack of caring after the botched spot in Danbury 18 months before. However, this is now believed to have been a 'work' on New Jack's part as closer inspection of the footage appears to show that Grimes threw himself off the scaffolding at an unexpected angle and with more velocity than intended.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn April 2003, New Jack was in a hardcore match with longtime wrestler [[Gilberto Melendez|Gypsy Joe]]. Before the match, Jack met Gypsy Joe and went to the booker of the show and asked exactly what he was supposed to do with Joe. Jack was told \"Gypsy Joe is as tough as leather\", and Jack replied that he was not going to lose dollar value from this match and would not have a comedy or gimmick match- but that he would kill Gypsy Joe in this match. For unknown reasons, Joe was continuously [[Sell (professional wrestling)|no-selling]] New Jack, and Joe headbutted him in the nose. New Jack then got angry with Joe and decided to get genuine sells by [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] attacking the 71-year-old man with a chain, a framed picture of his aunt, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, and several other weapons. The crowd, horrified by Jack's savage beating of this man either left the show in disgust or started calling Jack the \"n\" word- a term he had been called almost every week during his days in Smoky Mountain Wresting. In an interview for ''Vice''in 2019, Jack stated \"the more they called me a n****r, the angrier I got and the more I beat the guy (Gypsy Joe) up.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=New Jack attacks Gypsy Joe |url=http://www.wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/newjack_gypsyjoe.html |publisher=Wrestling Gone Wrong |accessdate=2008-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504220538/http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/newjack_gypsyjoe.html |archivedate=2006-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, New Jack, wrestling for Thunder Wrestling Federation, was scheduled to fight fellow wrestler William Jason Lane at an event near [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. During the match, Lane, to New Jack's surprise began punching him in the face legitimately and landed a few blows. New Jack then pulled out a metal blade from his camouflage wrestling attire, and stabbed Lane 9 times in the head. New Jack stated in the ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary series ''[[Dark Side of the Ring]]'' that the news stated he stabbed Lane 16 times. This action caused New Jack to receive various [[felony]] charges, including for [[Assault|aggravated assault]] with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault to commit [[murder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/10/13/666496.html |title=New Jack accused of stabbing opponent 9 times |publisher=Slam.canoe.ca |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> New Jack claims that the two met prior to the match and agreed to use a \"piece of metal\" to inflict injury. Despite this, a police officer who was recording the incident stated that it looked like it went \"past a routine wrestling match.\" The promoter of the event, Mr. Maurice Williams, claims the event was never intended to be hardcore. New Jack has claimed that he only stabbed Lane nine times.

On June 11, 2016, New Jack was set to face former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] star [[Phil Baroni]] in an unsanctioned match at a Pro Wrestling Syndicate event at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey.  In October, New Jack appeared at the Crushed 2 wrestling event in Minneapolis, MN interfering in a match between Eugene and Tommy Lee Curtis.  He ran out with the garbage can full of weapons and saved Eugene from a beat down and ended up doing a diving splash through a table to pin Tommy Lee Curtis even though he was only interfering.  It was billed as his last appearance in the Midwest. In January, Jack was eliminated in battle royal by White Mike but went on to defeat Mike in a singles match. In March, he teamed with fellow ECW Alumni [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] & [[Justin Credible]] in a winning effort at an ECW show.\n\n==Other media==\nIn the [[video game]] ''[[ECW Anarchy Rulz (video game)|ECW Anarchy Rulz]]'', New Jack's theme song was rerecorded by [[Bootsy Collins]] with unique lyrics, unlike every other character's theme, which consisted of cover versions of their real themes. The real theme (\"Natural Born Killaz\") could not be featured; copyright issues from their record labels wouldn't allow it. New Jack was featured in the 1999 wrestling [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. In addition, he appeared in the television series ''[[Early Edition]]'' on May 6, 2000 as a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker]] in the episode \"Mel Schwartz, Bounty Hunter\". He was also featured in the video game ''[[Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} New Jack is also the subject of an episode of the documentary series \"Dark Side of the Ring.\" The hour-long episode debuted on Vice on March 31, 2020.\n\nNew Jack is referenced in the 1996 [[Weezer]] single \"[[El Scorcho]]\".

New Jack commented that nothing could excuse what Benoit had done and all people on [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] and elsewhere who were making excuses for him were hypocrites.

The ''Normalsegelapparat'', patented in 1893 (US patent from 1895), was the first production aircraft in history. Like its preceding model, the ''Large Biplane'' is a hang glider which is controlled through weight-shift by the pilot, as hang gliders are to this day.\n\n==Development==\n\nThe objective of the biplane was to increase the wing surface of the monoplane ''Normalsegelapparat'' without increasing the wingspan. This would have made controlling the aircraft more difficult as the pilot only had limited range to shift his or her weight in the cockpit. Lilienthal had already upgraded one of his smaller monoplane models - the ''Sturmfl\u00fcgelmodell'' - to a smaller biplane that same year. While building the ''Large Biplane'' he made use of this experience. It was one of the many aircraft designs only flown by Lilienthal himself. Countless flights with both biplanes have been photographically documented. Lilienthal flew both gliders from his personal flying hill in Lichterfelde (Berlin). In 1896 he flew the ''Large Biplane'' at the ''Gollenberg'' near St\u00f6lln in Havelland. These two gliders are the first successful man carrying biplanes in history.\n\n==Construction Details==\n\nThe lower deck is the exact same size as the one used in Lilienthal's patented monoplane glider. The upper deck is not, like the lower one, completely foldable, but folds in the middle. Thus the glider is easily reduced to a transportable width of a little more than two meters. Besides the intent to increase lift, the upper deck also changes the flight mechanical properties in comparison to the monoplane. \nThe aerodynamic center is higher and therefore increases flight stability, but reduces lateral control authority.

The reconstruction of a replica of this glider type used for flight testing was possible by means of the patent drawings of the monoplane glider and many detailed photographs, of both the monoplane and the biplane.<ref name=DLR>{{cite web |title=The Lilienthal glider project |url=https://www.dlr.de/content/en/dossiers/2019/lilienthal-glider-project.html |website=GC_JOURNAL DLR Portal |publisher=DLR |accessdate=19 February 2020 |language=English, German}}</ref> The results prove that the glider was stable in pitch and roll and can be flown safely at moderate altitudes in smooth air.<ref name=\"Glenshaw\">{{cite web |last1=Glenshaw |first1=Paul |title=More Than a Century Later, Lilienthal and Wright Gliders Fly Together for the First Time at Kitty Hawk |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/more-century-later-lilienthal-and-wright-gliders-fly-together-first-time-kitty-hawk-180973882/ |website=Air & Space Magazine |accessdate=19 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=crash>{{cite journal |last1=Raffel |first1=Markus |title= The Lilienthal Bi-Plane Glider |journal= USHPA Pilot |volume=50 |issue=1 |date= January 2020  |pages=18\u201320}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications (typical)==\n\n[[File: 2019-07-30-flug-des-lilienthal-doppeldeckers.jpg|thumb|Andrew Beem (Windsports, LA) flying an authentic replica of the ''Gro\u00dfer Doppeldecker'' at the Californian coast (near Monterey) on July 29, 2019]]\n\n{{aircraft specs\n|ref=Die Flugzeuge von Otto Lilienthal<ref name=\"Nitsch\">{{cite book |last1=Nitsch |first1=Stephan |title=Die Flugzeuge von Otto Lilienthal : Technik - Dokumentation - Rekonstruktion |date=20 May 2016 |isbn=978-3941681880 |language=German |edition=Neuauflage}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n|crew=One\n|length m=5.30\n|span m=6.70\n|height m=\n|height ft=\n|height in=\n|wing area sqm=24\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|empty weight kg=25\n|gross weight kg=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|glide ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->4\n|sink rate ms=<!-- sailplanes -->\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Schwipps |first1=Werner |title=Vom Sprung zum Flug : der Flugtechniker Otto Lilienthal |date=1991 |publisher=Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus |location=Berlin |isbn=3-327-01090-0 |language=German |edition=1.

Rule under these kingdoms led to a rise in cultural exchange and cooperation between Muslims and [[Christians]]. [[People of the Book|Christians and Jews]] were subject to a special tax called [[jizya]], to the state, which in return provided internal autonomy in practicing their religion and offered the same level of protections by the Muslim rulers. The jizya was not only a tax, however, but also a symbolic expression of subordination.<ref>Lewis, Bernard. ''[[The Jews of Islam]]''; Meyrick, Fredrick. ''The Doctrine of the Church of England on the Holy Communion''. NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 14. \"Under the ruling Caliph (the descendant of Mohammed{{Snd}} the prophet of G\u2013d on earth), the Jews were able to preserve their rites and traditions.  Peaceful coexistence led to their economic and social expansion.  Their status was that of [[Dhimmis]], non-Muslims living in a land governed by Muslims. The Jews had limited autonomy, but full rights to practice their religion, as well as full protection by their Muslim rulers, but this did not occur for free. There was a specific tax called the [[jizya]] that Dhimmis had to pay to receive these benefits.  Having its origin in the Qur'an, it states Dhimmis who did not pay this tax, should either convert to Islam, or face the death penalty (Qur'an 9, 29). This tax, higher than the tax Muslims had to pay, was in several occasions one of the most important sources of income for the kingdom. The jizya was not only a tax, but also a symbolic expression of subordination (Lewis 14). \"It is a common misapprehension that the holy war meant that the Muslims gave their opponents a choice 'between Islam and the sword'. This was sometimes the case, but only when the opponents were polytheist and idol-worshippers.

After the fall of the Umayyad caliphate, al-Andalus was fragmented into minor states and principalities. Attacks from the Christians intensified, led by the Castilians under [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]. The Almoravid empire intervened and repelled the Christian attacks on the region, deposing the weak Andalusi Muslim princes, and included al-Andalus under direct [[Berber people|Berber]] rule. In the next century and a half, al-Andalus became a province of the Berber Muslim empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]], both based in [[Marrakesh]].\n\nUltimately, the Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian Peninsula overpowered the Muslim states to the south. In 1085, Alfonso VI captured [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], starting a gradual decline of Muslim power. With the fall of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, most of the south quickly fell under Christian rule and the [[Emirate of Granada]] became a tributary state of the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castile]]<!--'Kingdom of Castile' nomenclature refers to another era--> two years later.

After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on July 19, 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] under Muslim rule in a seven-year campaign. They crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and occupied Visigothic [[Septimania]] in southern France.\n\nMost of the Iberian peninsula became part of the expanding [[Umayyad|Umayyad Empire]], under the name of ''al-Andalus''. It was organized as a province subordinate to [[Ifriqiya]], so, for the first few decades, the [[List of Umayyad Governors of Al-Andalus|governors of al-Andalus]] were appointed by the emir of [[Kairouan]], rather than the Caliph in Damascus. The regional capital was set at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and the first influx of Muslim settlers was widely distributed.\n\nThe small army Tariq led in the initial conquest consisted mostly of Berbers, while Musa's largely Arab force of over 12,000 soldiers was accompanied by a group of [[Mawla|''maw\u0101l\u012b'']] (Arabic, \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a), that is, non-Arab Muslims, who were clients of the Arabs.

However, after crushing Odo's Berber ally [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] on the eastern Pyrenees, [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the Aquitanian duke, who in turn appealed to the [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing [[Avignon]] and [[Arles]] and overran much of [[Provence]]. In 737, they traveled up the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] valley, reaching as far north as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]].

Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were assigned the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed to carve out a rebel state in [[Cerdanya]] for a while.\n\nIn 740, a [[Berber Revolt]] erupted in the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa). To put down the rebellion, the Umayyad Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] dispatched a large Arab army, composed of regiments (''[[Jund]]s'') of [[Bilad Ash-Sham]],<ref>Specifically, 27,000 Arab troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main ''junds'' of [[Jund Dimashq|Jund Dimashq (Damascus)]], [[Jund Hims|Jund Hims (Homs)]], [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan)]], and [[Jund Filastin|Jund Filastin (Filastin)]], plus 3,000 from [[Jund Qinnasrin]]. An additional 3,000 were picked up in [[Egypt]]. See R. Dozy (1913) ''Spanish Islam: A History of the Muslims in Spain'' (translated by Francis Griffin Stokes from Dozy's original (1861) French ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne'', with consultation of the 1874 German version and the 1877 Spanish version) Chatto & Windus, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AtQ7yAftTdQC&pg=PA133 page 133]</ref> to North Africa. But the great Umayyad army was crushed by the Berber rebels at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (in Morocco). Heartened by the victories of their North African brethren, the Berbers of al-Andalus quickly raised their own revolt. Berber garrisons in the north of the Iberian Peninsula mutinied, deposed their Arab commanders, and organized a large rebel army to march against the strongholds of Toledo, Cordoba, and Algeciras.\n\nIn 741, Balj b.

However, a quarrel immediately erupted between the Syrian commanders and the Andalusi, the so-called \"original Arabs\" of the earlier contingents. The Syrians defeated them at the hard-fought Battle of Aqua Portora in August 742 but were too few to impose themselves on the province.\n\nThe quarrel was settled in 743 when [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Ab\u016b l-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r al-\u1e24us\u0101m]], the new governor of al-Andalus, assigned the Syrians to regimental fiefs across al-Andalus<ref name=\"Makki1992\">{{cite book|author=Mahmoud Makki|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi |editor2=Manuela Mar\u00edn|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&pg=PA12|year=1992|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-09599-3|pages=12\u201313|chapter=The Political History of Al-Andalus}}</ref>{{Snd}} the Damascus jund was established in Elvira ([[Granada]]), the Jordan jund in Rayyu ([[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Archidona]]), the Jund Filastin in [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Jerez]], the Emesa (Hims) jund in [[Seville]] and [[Niebla, Spain|Niebla]], and the Qinnasrin jund in [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]].

After the rebellious Berber garrisons evacuated the northern frontier fortresses, the Christian king [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] set about immediately seizing the empty forts for himself, quickly adding the northwestern provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]] to his fledgling kingdom. The Asturians evacuated the Christian populations from the towns and villages of the Galician-Leonese lowlands, creating an empty buffer zone in the [[Douro River]] valley (the \"[[Desert of the Duero]]\"). This newly emptied frontier remained roughly in place for the next few centuries as the boundary between the Christian north and the Islamic south. Between this frontier and its heartland in the south, the al-Andalus state had three large [[March (territory)|march territories]] (''[[thughur]]''): the [[Lower March]] (capital initially at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], later [[Badajoz]]), the Middle March (centered at Toledo), and the [[Upper March]] (centered at [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThese disturbances and disorders also allowed the Franks, now under the leadership of [[Pepin the Short]], to invade the strategic strip of [[Septimania]] in 752, hoping to deprive al-Andalus of an easy launching pad for raids into [[Francia]]. After a lengthy siege, the last Arab stronghold, the citadel of [[Narbonne]], finally [[Siege of Narbonne (752\u2013759)|fell to the Franks in 759]]. Al-Andalus was sealed off at the Pyrenees.<ref>[[Franco Cardini]], ''Europe and Islam '', Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the [[Damascus]] Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the [[Abbasid]]s in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the [[Fihrids]], an illustrious local Arab clan descended from [[Uqba ibn Nafi|Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri]], seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own{{Snd}} [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] in Ifriqiya and [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri]] in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence.  But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.\n\n=== Umayyad Emirate and Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ===\n{{main|Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba}}\nIn 756, the exiled Umayyad prince [[Abd al-Rahman I]] (nicknamed ''al-D\u0101khil'', the 'Immigrant') ousted Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri to establish himself as the [[Emir]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He refused to submit to the Abbasid caliph, as Abbasid forces had killed most of his family. Over a thirty-year reign, he established a tenuous rule over much of al-Andalus, overcoming partisans of both the al-Fihri family and of the Abbasid caliph.<ref>Collins, Roger.

Indeed, the power of emir [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad]] (circa 900) did not extend beyond C\u00f3rdoba itself. But his grandson [[Abd-al-Rahman III]], who succeeded him in 912, not only rapidly restored Umayyad power throughout al-Andalus but extended it into western North Africa as well. In 929 he proclaimed himself [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliph]], elevating the emirate to a position competing in prestige not only with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph in [[Baghdad]] but also the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph in [[Tunis]], with whom he was competing for control of North Africa.\n\n[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|left|The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th century]][[File:Hisham II of C\u00f3rdoba Dinar 94227.jpg|thumb|Gold dinar minted in C\u00f3rdoba during the reign of [[Hisham II]]]]\n\nThe period of the Caliphate is seen as the [[Islamic Golden Age|golden age]] of al-Andalus.

In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. The Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II]] rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but now weakened, were quickly conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of [[Murcia]] (1243) and the [[Algarve]] (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] remained as a Muslim state in Iberia, tributary of Castile until 1492. Most of its tribute was paid in gold that was carried to Iberia from present-day [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] through the merchant routes of the [[Sahara]].\n\nThe last Muslim threat to the Christian kingdoms was the rise of the [[Marinids]] in Morocco during the 14th century. They took Granada into their sphere of influence and occupied some of its cities, like [[Algeciras]]. However, they were unable to take [[Tarifa]], which held out until the arrival of the Castilian Army led by [[Alfonso XI]]. The Castilian king, with the help of [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] and [[Peter IV of Aragon]], decisively defeated the Marinids at the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] in 1340 and took Algeciras in 1344. [[Gibraltar]], then under Granadian rule, was [[Fifth Siege of Gibraltar|besieged in 1349\u201350]]. Alfonso XI and most of his army perished by the [[Black Death]]. His successor, [[Peter of Castile]], made peace with the Muslims and turned his attention to Christian lands, starting a period of almost 150 years of rebellions and wars between the Christian states that secured the survival of Granada.\n\n===Emirate of Granada, its fall, and aftermath===\n{{See also|Emirate of Granada|Nasrid dynasty|Granada War}}\n[[File:El rey chico de Granada.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A painting of [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]], last sultan of Granada.

In the 10th century a massive conversion of Christians took place, and ''[[muladi]]es'' (Muslims of native [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin), formed the majority of Muslims. The Muladies had spoken in a [[Romance languages|Romance]] dialect of Latin called [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] while increasingly adopting the Arabic language, which eventually evolved into the [[Andalusi Arabic]] in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians became monolingual in the last surviving Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada]] (1230\u20131492). Eventually, the Muladies, and later the Berber tribes, adopted an Arabic identity like the majority of subject people in [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[North Africa]].

Along with other astronomers, he undertook extensive work to edit the [[Toledan Tables|Toledan Zij]] astronomical tables.

These advances were in part facilitated by technological innovations in irrigation systems. State organized, large-scale irrigation projects provided water to city baths, mosques, gardens, residential homes, and governing palaces, such as the al-Hambra and its gardens in Granada. Collective, peasant-built irrigation infrastructure also played an important role, especially in agriculture. Many of these irrigation techniques, especially those utilized by peasants, were brought to al-Andalus by migrating [[Berbers|Berber]] and Arab tribes. Although some irrigation projects built on existing Roman infrastructure, most of al-Andalus's irrigation systems were new projects built separate from old Roman aqueducts.

Literacy in Islamic Iberia was far more widespread than in many other nations in the West at the time.<ref>Previte-Orton (1971), vol. 1, p. 377</ref> Thus, it also had an important literary activity; one specialist of Al-Andalus' intellectual history, Maria Luisa Avila, says that ''\"biographical dictionaries have recorded information about thousands of distinguished people in every period from al-Andalus, who were ''cultivators of knowledge'', particularly in the legal-religious sciences as well as authors\"'', and that ''\"the exact number of scholars which appears in the biographical sources has not been established yet, but it surely exceeds six thousand.\"''<ref>Maria Luisa Avila, \"Women in Andalusi Biographical Sources\" in Randi Deguilhem/Manuela Marin (ed.), ''Writing the Feminine: Women in Arab Sources'', I.B.Tauris (2002), p. 152</ref> It has been estimated that in the 10th century between 70,000 and 80,000 manuscripts were copied on a yearly basis in Cordoba alone.<ref>Stephan Roman, ''The development of Islamic library collections in Western Europe and North America'', Mansell Publishing (1990), p. x</ref>\n\nIn the 11th century the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] (base 10) reached Europe, via Al-Andalus through Spanish [[Muslim]]s together with knowledge of [[astronomy]] and instruments like the [[astrolabe]], first imported by [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]]. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as [[Arabic numerals]].\n\nFrom the earliest days, the Umayyads wanted to be seen as intellectual rivals to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], and for C\u00f3rdoba to have libraries and educational institutions to rival [[Baghdad|Baghdad's]].

These structures are still found in Andalusia province, particularly in Granada.<ref name=\"McKenzie2017\">{{cite web |author1=Clinton McKenzie |title=Acequias: Irrigation for a Growing Community |url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=0dde16704b1f4a7e8f329782729d6eda |website=www.arcgis.com |publisher=Bexar County Information Technology |accessdate=28 March 2020 |date=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{no footnotes|section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Al-Andalus philosophy====\n{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}\n\nThe historian [[Said al-Andalusi]] wrote that Caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] had collected libraries of books and granted patronage to scholars of [[medicine]] and \"ancient sciences\". Later, ''al-Mustansir'' ([[Al-Hakam II]]) went yet further, building a university and libraries in C\u00f3rdoba. C\u00f3rdoba became one of the world's leading centres of medicine and philosophical debate.\n\n[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Averroes]], founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, was influential in the rise of [[Secularism|secular thought]] in [[Western Europe]]. Detail from ''Triunfo de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' by [[Andrea Bonaiuto]], 14th century]]\n\nWhen Al-Hakam's son [[Hisham II]] took over, real power was ceded to the ''hajib'', [[al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]]. Al-Mansur was a distinctly religious man and disapproved of the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[logic]], and especially of [[astrology]], so much so that many books on these subjects, which had been preserved and collected at great expense by [[Al-Hakam II]], were [[Book burning|burned publicly]]. With Al-Mansur's death in 1002, interest in philosophy revived. Numerous scholars emerged, including [[Abu Uthman Ibn Fathun]], whose masterwork was the philosophical treatise \"[[Tree of Wisdom]]\". [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (died 1008) was an outstanding scholar in astronomy and astrology; he was an intrepid traveller who journeyed all over the Islamic world and beyond and kept in touch with the [[Brethren of Purity]]. He is said to have brought the 51 \"[[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]]\" to ''al-Andalus'' and added the compendium to this work, although it is quite possible that it was added later by another scholar with the name al-Majriti. Another book attributed to al-Majriti is the ''[[Ghayat al-Hakim]]'', \"The Aim of the Sage\", which explored a synthesis of [[Platonism]] with [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosophy]]. Its use of incantations led the book to be widely dismissed in later years, although the [[Sufi]] communities continued to study it.\n\nA prominent follower of al-Majriti was the philosopher and geometer [[Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani]] who was followed, in turn, by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Sayigh, usually known in the Arab world as [[Ibn Bajjah]], \"[[Avempace]]\".\n\nThe al-Andalus philosopher [[Averroes]] (1126\u20131198) was the founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, and his works and commentaries influenced medieval thought in Western Europe{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Another influential al-Andalus philosopher was [[Ibn Tufail]].\n\n====Jewish philosophy and culture====\n{{Main|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain}}\n[[File:Located in central Spain, 70 km south of Madrid. It is the capital of the province of Toledo.jpg|thumb|Jewish Street Sign in [[Toledo, Spain]]]]\n\nAs [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Jewish thought in Babylonia]] declined, the tolerance of ''al-Andalus'' made it the new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like [[Judah Halevi]] (1086\u20131145) and [[Dunash ben Labrat]] (920\u2013990) contributed to the cultural life of ''al-Andalus'', but the area was even more important to the development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see [[joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies]]), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131205), though he did not actually do any of his work in ''al-Andalus'', his family having fled persecution by the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] when he was 13.\n\n====Homosexuality====\nThe [[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]] states that \"Al-Andalus had many links to Hellenistic culture, and except for the Almoravid and Almohadic periods (1086\u20131212), it was hedonistic and tolerant of homosexuality, indeed one of the times in world history in which sensuality of all sorts has been most openly enjoyed. Important rulers such as Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and al-Mu-tamid openly chose boys as sexual partners, and kept catamites. Homosexual prostitution was widespread, and its customers came from higher levels of society than those of heterosexual prostitutes.\" The poetry of writers such as [[Abu Nuwas]] and anthologies of poetry such as the [[R\u0101y\u0101t al-mubarriz\u012bn wa-gh\u0101y\u0101t al-mumayyaz\u012bn]] are known in part for their homoerotic and \"abundant pederastic poetry\". Such themes were also found in the Sephardic Jewish poetry of the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dynes |first1=Wayne R. |title=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317368120 |pages=1237 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g7TOCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=al-Andalus+homosexual#v=onepage&q=al-Andalus%20homosexual&f=false |accessdate=10 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the book ''Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia'' Daniel Eisenberg describes [[homosexuality]] as \"a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia\", stating that \"in al-Andalus homosexual pleasures were much indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. Evidence includes the behaviour of rulers, such as Abd al-Rahmn III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid, who openly kept male harems; the memoirs of [[Abdallah ibn Buluggin]], last Zirid king of Granada, makes references to male prostitutes, who charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counter-parts: the repeated criticisms of Christians; and especially the abundant poetry. Both [[pederasty]] and love between adult males are found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so.\" Male homosexual relations allowed nonprocreative sexual practices and were not seen as a form of identity. Very little is known about the homosexual behaviour of women.<ref name=\"GerliArmistead2003\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Eisenberg |editor1=E. Michael Gerli |editor2=Samuel G.

Rule under these kingdoms led to a rise in cultural exchange and cooperation between Muslims and [[Christians]]. [[People of the Book|Christians and Jews]] were subject to a special tax called [[jizya]], to the state, which in return provided internal autonomy in practicing their religion and offered the same level of protections by the Muslim rulers. The jizya was not only a tax, however, but also a symbolic expression of subordination.<ref>Lewis, Bernard. ''[[The Jews of Islam]]''; Meyrick, Fredrick. ''The Doctrine of the Church of England on the Holy Communion''. NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 14. \"Under the ruling Caliph (the descendant of Mohammed{{Snd}} the prophet of G\u2013d on earth), the Jews were able to preserve their rites and traditions.  Peaceful coexistence led to their economic and social expansion.  Their status was that of [[Dhimmis]], non-Muslims living in a land governed by Muslims. The Jews had limited autonomy, but full rights to practice their religion, as well as full protection by their Muslim rulers, but this did not occur for free. There was a specific tax called the [[jizya]] that Dhimmis had to pay to receive these benefits.  Having its origin in the Qur'an, it states Dhimmis who did not pay this tax, should either convert to Islam, or face the death penalty (Qur'an 9, 29). This tax, higher than the tax Muslims had to pay, was in several occasions one of the most important sources of income for the kingdom. The jizya was not only a tax, but also a symbolic expression of subordination (Lewis 14). \"It is a common misapprehension that the holy war meant that the Muslims gave their opponents a choice 'between Islam and the sword'. This was sometimes the case, but only when the opponents were polytheist and idol-worshippers. For Jews, Christians, and other 'People of the Book', there was a third possibility, they might become a 'protected group', paying a tax or tribute to the Muslims but enjoying internal autonomy\" (Watt 144).</ref>\n\nUnder the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, al-Andalus was a beacon of learning, and the city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], the largest in Europe, became one of the leading cultural and economic centres throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], Europe, and the Islamic world. Achievements that advanced Islamic and Western science came from al-Andalus, including [[ibn Firnas]]'s invention of the first [[glider]] and other major advances in trigonometry ([[Jabir ibn Aflah|Geber]]), astronomy ([[Arzachel]]), surgery ([[Abulcasis|Abulcasis Al Zahrawi]]), pharmacology ([[Avenzoar]]),<ref name=\"rediscScience\">{{Cite journal|last=Covington|first=Richard|year=2007|editor-last=Arndt|editor-first=Robert|title=Rediscovering Arabic Science|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200703/rediscovering.arabic.science.htm|journal=Saudi Aramco World|publisher=Aramco Services Company|volume=58|issue=3|pages=2\u201316}}</ref> [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|agronomy]] ([[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Ab\u016b l-Khayr al-Ishb\u012bl\u012b]]), and works of [[Averroes]].

After the fall of the Umayyad caliphate, al-Andalus was fragmented into minor states and principalities. Attacks from the Christians intensified, led by the Castilians under [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]. The Almoravid empire intervened and repelled the Christian attacks on the region, deposing the weak Andalusi Muslim princes, and included al-Andalus under direct [[Berber people|Berber]] rule. In the next century and a half, al-Andalus became a province of the Berber Muslim empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]], both based in [[Marrakesh]].\n\nUltimately, the Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian Peninsula overpowered the Muslim states to the south. In 1085, Alfonso VI captured [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], starting a gradual decline of Muslim power. With the fall of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, most of the south quickly fell under Christian rule and the [[Emirate of Granada]] became a tributary state of the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castile]]<!--'Kingdom of Castile' nomenclature refers to another era--> two years later. In 1249, the Portuguese Reconquista culminated with the conquest of the [[Algarve]] by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], leaving Granada as the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula.

The phonetic, morphosyntactic, and historical problems connected with this etymology are too numerous. Moreover, the existence of this name in various parts of central and northern Spain proves that ''Al-Andalus'' cannot be derived from this [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. It was the original name of the Punta Marroqu\u00ed cape near Tarifa; very soon, it became generalized to designate the whole Peninsula. Undoubtedly, the name is of Pre-Indo-European origin.

After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on July 19, 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] under Muslim rule in a seven-year campaign. They crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and occupied Visigothic [[Septimania]] in southern France.\n\nMost of the Iberian peninsula became part of the expanding [[Umayyad|Umayyad Empire]], under the name of ''al-Andalus''. It was organized as a province subordinate to [[Ifriqiya]], so, for the first few decades, the [[List of Umayyad Governors of Al-Andalus|governors of al-Andalus]] were appointed by the emir of [[Kairouan]], rather than the Caliph in Damascus. The regional capital was set at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and the first influx of Muslim settlers was widely distributed.\n\nThe small army Tariq led in the initial conquest consisted mostly of Berbers, while Musa's largely Arab force of over 12,000 soldiers was accompanied by a group of [[Mawla|''maw\u0101l\u012b'']] (Arabic, \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a), that is, non-Arab Muslims, who were clients of the Arabs.

However, after crushing Odo's Berber ally [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] on the eastern Pyrenees, [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the Aquitanian duke, who in turn appealed to the [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing [[Avignon]] and [[Arles]] and overran much of [[Provence]]. In 737, they traveled up the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] valley, reaching as far north as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Charles Martel of the Franks, with the assistance of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], invaded Burgundy and Provence and expelled the raiders by 739.\n\n[[File:Mezquita-Catedral de Cordoba 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Interior of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba]] formerly the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba. The original mosque (742), since much enlarged, was built on the site of the Visigothic Christian 'Saint Vincent basilica' (600).]]\n\nRelations between Arabs and [[Berber people|Berbers]] in al-Andalus had been tense in the years after the conquest. Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were assigned the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed to carve out a rebel state in [[Cerdanya]] for a while.\n\nIn 740, a [[Berber Revolt]] erupted in the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa). To put down the rebellion, the Umayyad Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] dispatched a large Arab army, composed of regiments (''[[Jund]]s'') of [[Bilad Ash-Sham]],<ref>Specifically, 27,000 Arab troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main ''junds'' of [[Jund Dimashq|Jund Dimashq (Damascus)]], [[Jund Hims|Jund Hims (Homs)]], [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan)]], and [[Jund Filastin|Jund Filastin (Filastin)]], plus 3,000 from [[Jund Qinnasrin]]. An additional 3,000 were picked up in [[Egypt]]. See R. Dozy (1913) ''Spanish Islam: A History of the Muslims in Spain'' (translated by Francis Griffin Stokes from Dozy's original (1861) French ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne'', with consultation of the 1874 German version and the 1877 Spanish version) Chatto & Windus, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AtQ7yAftTdQC&pg=PA133 page 133]</ref> to North Africa. But the great Umayyad army was crushed by the Berber rebels at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (in Morocco). Heartened by the victories of their North African brethren, the Berbers of al-Andalus quickly raised their own revolt. Berber garrisons in the north of the Iberian Peninsula mutinied, deposed their Arab commanders, and organized a large rebel army to march against the strongholds of Toledo, Cordoba, and Algeciras.\n\nIn 741, Balj b.

However, a quarrel immediately erupted between the Syrian commanders and the Andalusi, the so-called \"original Arabs\" of the earlier contingents. The Syrians defeated them at the hard-fought Battle of Aqua Portora in August 742 but were too few to impose themselves on the province.\n\nThe quarrel was settled in 743 when [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Ab\u016b l-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r al-\u1e24us\u0101m]], the new governor of al-Andalus, assigned the Syrians to regimental fiefs across al-Andalus<ref name=\"Makki1992\">{{cite book|author=Mahmoud Makki|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi |editor2=Manuela Mar\u00edn|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&pg=PA12|year=1992|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-09599-3|pages=12\u201313|chapter=The Political History of Al-Andalus}}</ref>{{Snd}} the Damascus jund was established in Elvira ([[Granada]]), the Jordan jund in Rayyu ([[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Archidona]]), the Jund Filastin in [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Jerez]], the Emesa (Hims) jund in [[Seville]] and [[Niebla, Spain|Niebla]], and the Qinnasrin jund in [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]].

However, at the same time, unwilling to be governed, the Syrian ''junds'' carried on an existence of autonomous feudal anarchy, severely destabilizing the authority of the governor of al-Andalus.\n\n[[File:Abdul al Rahman I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[Abd al-Rahman I]]]]\n\nA second significant consequence of the revolt was the expansion of the [[Kingdom of the Asturias]], hitherto confined to enclaves in the Cantabrian highlands. After the rebellious Berber garrisons evacuated the northern frontier fortresses, the Christian king [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] set about immediately seizing the empty forts for himself, quickly adding the northwestern provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]] to his fledgling kingdom. The Asturians evacuated the Christian populations from the towns and villages of the Galician-Leonese lowlands, creating an empty buffer zone in the [[Douro River]] valley (the \"[[Desert of the Duero]]\"). This newly emptied frontier remained roughly in place for the next few centuries as the boundary between the Christian north and the Islamic south. Between this frontier and its heartland in the south, the al-Andalus state had three large [[March (territory)|march territories]] (''[[thughur]]''): the [[Lower March]] (capital initially at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], later [[Badajoz]]), the Middle March (centered at Toledo), and the [[Upper March]] (centered at [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThese disturbances and disorders also allowed the Franks, now under the leadership of [[Pepin the Short]], to invade the strategic strip of [[Septimania]] in 752, hoping to deprive al-Andalus of an easy launching pad for raids into [[Francia]]. After a lengthy siege, the last Arab stronghold, the citadel of [[Narbonne]], finally [[Siege of Narbonne (752\u2013759)|fell to the Franks in 759]]. Al-Andalus was sealed off at the Pyrenees.<ref>[[Franco Cardini]], ''Europe and Islam '', Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the [[Damascus]] Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the [[Abbasid]]s in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the [[Fihrids]], an illustrious local Arab clan descended from [[Uqba ibn Nafi|Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri]], seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own{{Snd}} [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] in Ifriqiya and [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri]] in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence.  But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.\n\n=== Umayyad Emirate and Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ===\n{{main|Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba}}\nIn 756, the exiled Umayyad prince [[Abd al-Rahman I]] (nicknamed ''al-D\u0101khil'', the 'Immigrant') ousted Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri to establish himself as the [[Emir]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He refused to submit to the Abbasid caliph, as Abbasid forces had killed most of his family. Over a thirty-year reign, he established a tenuous rule over much of al-Andalus, overcoming partisans of both the al-Fihri family and of the Abbasid caliph.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710\u2013797'', pp. 113\u2013140 & 168\u2013182.</ref>\n\nFor the next century and a half, his descendants continued as emirs of C\u00f3rdoba with nominal control over the rest of al-Andalus and sometimes parts of western [[North Africa]], but with real control, particularly over the marches along the Christian border, vacillating depending on the competence of the individual emir. Indeed, the power of emir [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad]] (circa 900) did not extend beyond C\u00f3rdoba itself. But his grandson [[Abd-al-Rahman III]], who succeeded him in 912, not only rapidly restored Umayyad power throughout al-Andalus but extended it into western North Africa as well. In 929 he proclaimed himself [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliph]], elevating the emirate to a position competing in prestige not only with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph in [[Baghdad]] but also the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph in [[Tunis]], with whom he was competing for control of North Africa.\n\n[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|left|The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th century]][[File:Hisham II of C\u00f3rdoba Dinar 94227.jpg|thumb|Gold dinar minted in C\u00f3rdoba during the reign of [[Hisham II]]]]\n\nThe period of the Caliphate is seen as the [[Islamic Golden Age|golden age]] of al-Andalus.

In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. The Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II]] rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but now weakened, were quickly conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of [[Murcia]] (1243) and the [[Algarve]] (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] remained as a Muslim state in Iberia, tributary of Castile until 1492. Most of its tribute was paid in gold that was carried to Iberia from present-day [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] through the merchant routes of the [[Sahara]].\n\nThe last Muslim threat to the Christian kingdoms was the rise of the [[Marinids]] in Morocco during the 14th century.

In the 10th century a massive conversion of Christians took place, and ''[[muladi]]es'' (Muslims of native [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin), formed the majority of Muslims. The Muladies had spoken in a [[Romance languages|Romance]] dialect of Latin called [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] while increasingly adopting the Arabic language, which eventually evolved into the [[Andalusi Arabic]] in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians became monolingual in the last surviving Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada]] (1230\u20131492). Eventually, the Muladies, and later the Berber tribes, adopted an Arabic identity like the majority of subject people in [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[North Africa]].

The curve, moreover, makes possible a reasonable estimate of the religious distribution of the population. Assuming that there were seven million Hispano-Romans in the peninsula in 711 and that the numbers of this segment of the population remained level through the eleventh century (with population growth balancing out Christian migration to the north), then by 912 there would have been approximately 2.8 million indigenous Muslims (muwallad\u00fbn) plus Arabs and Berbers.

Literacy in Islamic Iberia was far more widespread than in many other nations in the West at the time.<ref>Previte-Orton (1971), vol. 1, p. 377</ref> Thus, it also had an important literary activity; one specialist of Al-Andalus' intellectual history, Maria Luisa Avila, says that ''\"biographical dictionaries have recorded information about thousands of distinguished people in every period from al-Andalus, who were ''cultivators of knowledge'', particularly in the legal-religious sciences as well as authors\"'', and that ''\"the exact number of scholars which appears in the biographical sources has not been established yet, but it surely exceeds six thousand.\"''<ref>Maria Luisa Avila, \"Women in Andalusi Biographical Sources\" in Randi Deguilhem/Manuela Marin (ed.), ''Writing the Feminine: Women in Arab Sources'', I.B.Tauris (2002), p. 152</ref> It has been estimated that in the 10th century between 70,000 and 80,000 manuscripts were copied on a yearly basis in Cordoba alone.<ref>Stephan Roman, ''The development of Islamic library collections in Western Europe and North America'', Mansell Publishing (1990), p. x</ref>\n\nIn the 11th century the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] (base 10) reached Europe, via Al-Andalus through Spanish [[Muslim]]s together with knowledge of [[astronomy]] and instruments like the [[astrolabe]], first imported by [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]]. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as [[Arabic numerals]].\n\nFrom the earliest days, the Umayyads wanted to be seen as intellectual rivals to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], and for C\u00f3rdoba to have libraries and educational institutions to rival [[Baghdad|Baghdad's]]. Although there was a clear rivalry between the two powers, there was freedom to travel between the two caliphates,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} which helped spread new ideas and innovations over time.\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n{{Main|Moorish architecture|Mud\u00e9jar|Moorish Revival architecture}}\n[[File:Granada's sunset.jpg|thumb|The [[Alhambra]], constructed by order of the first Nasrid emir [[Muhammad I of Granada|Ibn al-Ahmar]] in the 13th century]]\n[[File:CSM 185 (187).jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad I of Granada]] (red shield), depicted in an illustration taken from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria|Cantigas de Santa Mar\u00eda]]'']]\nThe [[Alhambra]] palace and fortress as well as the [[Generalife]] in Granada reflect the culture and art of the last centuries of Moorish rule of Al-Andalus.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Alhambra, The |ref=harv |volume=1|pages=656\u2013658}}</ref> The complex was completed at this stage towards the end of the rule by [[Yusuf I]] (1333\u20131353) and [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada]] (1353\u20131391). Artists and intellectuals took refuge at Alhambra after the Reconquista began to roll back Muslim territory. The site integrates natural qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Al-Andalus and to the skills of the Muslim artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\n\nThe decoration within the palace comes from the last great period of Al-Andalus art in Granada, with little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary [[Abbasid architecture]].<ref name=EB1911 /> Artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty using elements created and developed during the centuries of Muslim rule on the Peninsula, including the Caliphate [[horseshoe arch]], the Almohad sebka (a grid of [[rhombuses]]), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of these, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and [[muqarnas]] (stalactite ceiling decorations). Columns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with [[arabesques]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]]. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Muhammed V, and [[Ismail I, Sultan of Granada]].\n[[File:Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba (Spain).jpg|thumb|A section of the hypostyle hall in the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]\nIn Cordoba, the Umayyads sponsored the construction of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]] (now a Catholic church); its key features included an arcaded hypostyle hall with 856 columns, a horseshoe-arch mihrab facing Mecca, a vaulted dome, the Court of Oranges (containing fountains and imported citrus trees) and a minaret (later converted into a bell-tower).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/early-europe-and-colonial-americas/ap-art-islamic-world-medieval/a/the-great-mosque-of-cordoba|title=The Great Mosque of Cordoba|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> The Umayyads reconstructed the [[Roman bridge of C\u00f3rdoba|Roman-era bridge]] over the Guadalquivir River in Cordoba, while the Almohads later added the [[Calahorra Tower]] to the bridge.\n\nIn Seville, Moorish rulers built the main section of the [[Giralda]] (later expanded as a bell-tower for the Seville Cathedral) as a massive minaret (resembling that of the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Morocco) for the Great Mosque of Seville, which also contained a ''Patio de los Naranjos'' (Court of Oranges).

Later, ''al-Mustansir'' ([[Al-Hakam II]]) went yet further, building a university and libraries in C\u00f3rdoba. C\u00f3rdoba became one of the world's leading centres of medicine and philosophical debate.\n\n[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Averroes]], founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, was influential in the rise of [[Secularism|secular thought]] in [[Western Europe]]. Detail from ''Triunfo de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' by [[Andrea Bonaiuto]], 14th century]]\n\nWhen Al-Hakam's son [[Hisham II]] took over, real power was ceded to the ''hajib'', [[al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]]. Al-Mansur was a distinctly religious man and disapproved of the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[logic]], and especially of [[astrology]], so much so that many books on these subjects, which had been preserved and collected at great expense by [[Al-Hakam II]], were [[Book burning|burned publicly]]. With Al-Mansur's death in 1002, interest in philosophy revived. Numerous scholars emerged, including [[Abu Uthman Ibn Fathun]], whose masterwork was the philosophical treatise \"[[Tree of Wisdom]]\". [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (died 1008) was an outstanding scholar in astronomy and astrology; he was an intrepid traveller who journeyed all over the Islamic world and beyond and kept in touch with the [[Brethren of Purity]]. He is said to have brought the 51 \"[[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]]\" to ''al-Andalus'' and added the compendium to this work, although it is quite possible that it was added later by another scholar with the name al-Majriti. Another book attributed to al-Majriti is the ''[[Ghayat al-Hakim]]'', \"The Aim of the Sage\", which explored a synthesis of [[Platonism]] with [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosophy]]. Its use of incantations led the book to be widely dismissed in later years, although the [[Sufi]] communities continued to study it.\n\nA prominent follower of al-Majriti was the philosopher and geometer [[Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani]] who was followed, in turn, by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Sayigh, usually known in the Arab world as [[Ibn Bajjah]], \"[[Avempace]]\".\n\nThe al-Andalus philosopher [[Averroes]] (1126\u20131198) was the founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, and his works and commentaries influenced medieval thought in Western Europe{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Another influential al-Andalus philosopher was [[Ibn Tufail]].\n\n====Jewish philosophy and culture====\n{{Main|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain}}\n[[File:Located in central Spain, 70 km south of Madrid. It is the capital of the province of Toledo.jpg|thumb|Jewish Street Sign in [[Toledo, Spain]]]]\n\nAs [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Jewish thought in Babylonia]] declined, the tolerance of ''al-Andalus'' made it the new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like [[Judah Halevi]] (1086\u20131145) and [[Dunash ben Labrat]] (920\u2013990) contributed to the cultural life of ''al-Andalus'', but the area was even more important to the development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see [[joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies]]), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131205), though he did not actually do any of his work in ''al-Andalus'', his family having fled persecution by the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] when he was 13.\n\n====Homosexuality====\nThe [[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]] states that \"Al-Andalus had many links to Hellenistic culture, and except for the Almoravid and Almohadic periods (1086\u20131212), it was hedonistic and tolerant of homosexuality, indeed one of the times in world history in which sensuality of all sorts has been most openly enjoyed. Important rulers such as Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and al-Mu-tamid openly chose boys as sexual partners, and kept catamites. Homosexual prostitution was widespread, and its customers came from higher levels of society than those of heterosexual prostitutes.\" The poetry of writers such as [[Abu Nuwas]] and anthologies of poetry such as the [[R\u0101y\u0101t al-mubarriz\u012bn wa-gh\u0101y\u0101t al-mumayyaz\u012bn]] are known in part for their homoerotic and \"abundant pederastic poetry\".

Evidence includes the behaviour of rulers, such as Abd al-Rahmn III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid, who openly kept male harems; the memoirs of [[Abdallah ibn Buluggin]], last Zirid king of Granada, makes references to male prostitutes, who charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counter-parts: the repeated criticisms of Christians; and especially the abundant poetry. Both [[pederasty]] and love between adult males are found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so.\" Male homosexual relations allowed nonprocreative sexual practices and were not seen as a form of identity.
