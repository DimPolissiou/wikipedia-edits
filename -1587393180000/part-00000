{"title_page": "Liquid crystal", "text_new": "{{short description|State of matter with properties of both conventional liquids and crystals}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:Nematische Phase Schlierentextur.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Schlieren]] texture of liquid crystal [[nematic]] phase]]\n\n'''Liquid crystals (LCs)''' are a [[state of matter]] which has properties between those of conventional [[liquid]]s and those of solid [[crystal]]s. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II, work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W.

Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior.

At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal.<ref name=b2/><ref name=b1/> Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed.

This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37\u201343 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008152304/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order.

This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly.

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_i</math>, <math>D_i</math> and <math>P_i</math> are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n\n: <math>f_\\text{elec} = -\\frac{1}{2} D_i E_i</math>\n\n(summation over the doubly appearing index <math>i</math>). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of <math>n</math>. The most general form to express <math>D</math> is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_\\bot E_i + \\left(\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot\\right) n_i n_j E_j </math>\n\n(summation over the index <math>j</math>) with <math>\\epsilon_\\bot</math> and <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel</math> the electric [[permittivity]] parallel and perpendicular to the director <math>n</math>.

[[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators.

For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press</ref> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior.

This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects.

This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly.

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices <ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_i</math>, <math>D_i</math> and <math>P_i</math> are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n\n: <math>f_\\text{elec} = -\\frac{1}{2} D_i E_i</math>\n\n(summation over the doubly appearing index <math>i</math>). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of <math>n</math>. The most general form to express <math>D</math> is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_\\bot E_i + \\left(\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot\\right) n_i n_j E_j </math>\n\n(summation over the index <math>j</math>) with <math>\\epsilon_\\bot</math> and <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel</math> the electric [[permittivity]] parallel and perpendicular to the director <math>n</math>.

If <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot</math> is positive, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when <math>E</math> and <math>n</math> are parallel. This means that the system will favor aligning the liquid crystal with the externally applied electric field. If <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot</math> is negative, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when <math>E</math> and <math>n</math> are perpendicular (in nematics the perpendicular orientation is degenerated, making possible the emergence of vortices<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barboza |first1=R. |last2=Bortolozzo |first2=U. |last3=Assanto |first3=G. |last4=Vidal-Henriquez |first4=E. |last5=Clerc |first5=M.

There are both <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> and <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> commercial liquid crystals. [[5CB]] and [[E7 liquid crystal mixture]] are two <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> liquid crystals commonly used. [[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be [[ferroelectric]] or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal phases of dipolar hard ellipsoids|journal=Phys.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Integrating liquid crystal based optical devices in photonic crystal| doi = 10.1007/s11082-007-9139-8|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume = 39| issue =12\u201313|date =2007| page = 1009|last1 = Alkeskjold|first1 = Thomas Tanggaard|last2 = Scolari|first2 = Lara|last3 = Noordegraaf|first3 = Danny|last4 = L\u00e6gsgaard|first4 = Jesper|last5 = Weirich|first5 = Johannes|last6 = Wei|first6 = Lei|last7 = Tartarini|first7 = Giovanni|last8 = Bassi|first8 = Paolo|last9 = Gauza|first9 = Sebastian| last10 = Wu| first10 = Shin-Tson| last11 = Bjarklev| first11 = Anders}}</ref>\n\n[[Liquid crystal tunable filter]]s are used as [[electrooptical]] devices,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKwlrW-CrxUC&pg=PA16|title=Piezoelectric Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications|last=Ciofani|first=Gianni|last2=Menciassi|first2=Arianna|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642280443}}</ref> e.g., in [[hyperspectral imaging]].\n\n[[thermochromism|Thermotropic]] chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude [[liquid crystal thermometer]]s, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed.

As the third installment released in the [[The Lion King (franchise)|''Lion King'' media franchise]], it is the final installment in the trilogy, and focuses on the escapades of the meerkat/warthog duo [[Timon and Pumbaa]] before, during and after the events of ''[[The Lion King]]''. Much of the original voice cast from [[The Lion King|the first film]] returns to reprise their roles, including [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Ernie Sabella]] as the voices of Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Timon and Pumbaa]] watch [[The Lion King|the original film]] in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to their scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory, going back to before the beginning of the movie.\n\nTimon is a social outcast in his [[meerkat]] colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his [[List of The Lion King characters#Ma|mother]], Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the death of his [[List of The Lion King characters#Uncle Max|Uncle Max]] by [[List of The Lion King characters#Scar|Scar]]'s hyena minions [[List of The Lion King characters#Shenzi.2C Banzai and Ed|Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]]. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets the mandrill [[Rafiki (The Lion King)|Rafiki]], who teaches him about \"[[Hakuna Matata]]\" and advises him to \"look beyond what you see\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon.\n\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of [[Simba]] to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas due to his fear of crowds, causing nearby animals to faint, but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\", Mufasa's fight with the hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa, and are thrown off a waterfall in their attempt to escape. \n\nPumbaa then briefly pauses the movie to go refill his popcorn and Timon patiently waits for him. \n\nExhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle he tried to tell Timon about earlier. They finally settle there with the philosophy of Hakuna Matata.\n\nEventually, Timon and Pumbaa encounter Simba in a nearby desert, nearly dead. They rescue him and decide to raise him under their philosophy. Years later, [[List of The Lion King characters#Nala|Nala]] appears and reunites with Simba after chasing and mistaking Pumbaa for food. Believing Hakuna Matata to be in jeopardy, Timon and Pumbaa attempt to sabotage their dates, but fail every time. After they witness Simba and Nala's argument, Simba disappears. Nala explains that he had run off to challenge Scar and reclaim Pride Rock, so that they need their help. Upset that Simba left them, Timon unsuccessfully tries to persuade Pumbaa to stay, but Pumbaa follows Simba and Nala. Timon indulges in the jungle's luxuries by himself, but loneliness starts to overcome him. Rafiki appears again and indirectly helps Timon realize that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves, prompting Timon to take off after Pumbaa, Simba and Nala.\n\nTimon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa, before they journey onward to Pride Rock. After helping Simba and Nala distract the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max, who came looking for Timon, who introduces Pumbaa to them. Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of Scar and the hyenas. While Simba battles Scar, Ma and Uncle Max are directed to construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas, as at the same time, Timon and Pumbaa use various tactics to distract them while the tunnel is being made. When the tunnels are finished, Max knocks down the support beams, breaking the ground under the hyenas. However, the last few get jammed, prompting Timon to dive underground and break them himself. The cave-in commences, and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels in time to confront Scar and kill him. Simba accepts his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands, thanking Timon and Pumbaa for his help. Timon takes Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max, and the meerkat colony to live in the predator-free jungle to complete his Hakuna Matata, and he is praised as their hero.\n\nOnce the story finishes, Ma, Uncle Max, Simba, Rafiki, and eventually many other Disney characters join Timon and Pumbaa to rewind the film in the theater in which Pumbaa tells Timon that he 'still doesn't do well in crowds'.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa#Timon|Timon]], a [[meerkat]] who is Pumbaa's best friend. Though somewhat selfish, arrogant, and withdrawn, Timon shows courageous loyalty towards his friends. Lianne Hughes and Alexs Stadermann served as the supervising animators for Timon.\n* [[Ernie Sabella]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa#Timon|Pumbaa]], a [[warthog]] who is Timon's best friend. Though slow-witted, he is very [[Empathy|empathetic]] and willing to trust and befriend anyone. He is also [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] and passes gas in crowds. Bob Baxter served as the supervising animator for Pumbaa.\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Simba]], Mufasa and Sarabi's son, Scar's nephew, Nala's husband and the current King of the Pride Lands.\n**Matt Weinberg voices Simba as a cub replacing [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]. \n* [[Julie Kavner]] as [[List of The Lion King characters#Ma|Ma]], Timon's caring mother. She is overly protective and attached to her son, often trying to get him accepted amongst the colony, but never succeeding. \n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as [[List of The Lion King characters#Uncle Max|Uncle Max]], Timon's [[Paranoia|paranoid]], eccentric but deep down kind-hearted uncle. He initially doubts Timon's ability, but warms up to him at the film's climax. \n* [[Moira Kelly]] as [[Nala (Disney)|Nala]], Simba's childhood friend and eventual wife. Most of her dialogue is archived from the original film. She only has one scene with newly-recorded dialogue.\n*CHEECH MARIN Azizi FLORENCE KASUMBA Shenzi KEEGAN MICHAEL KEY Ed \n* [[Robert Guillaume]] as [[List of characters in The Lion King#Rafiki|Rafiki]], a [[mandrill]] who teaches Timon Hakuna Matata, as well as giving him faith in himself to do what he dreams of doing. \n* [[Edward Hibbert]] as [[List of The Lion King characters#Zazu|Zazu]], a [[red-billed hornbill]] and the [[majordomo]] to Mufasa and later Simba.\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] as Zebras\n* Jason Rudofsky as Flinchy, a meerkat.\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2000, it was announced that the Walt Disney Company selected Jeff Ahlholm, Colin Goldman, and Tom Rogers to write the script for ''The Lion King 3''.

As the third installment released in the [[The Lion King (franchise)|''Lion King'' media franchise]], it is the final installment in the trilogy, and focuses on the escapades of the meerkat/warthog duo [[Timon and Pumbaa]] before, during and after the events of ''[[The Lion King]]''. Much of the original voice cast from [[The Lion King|the first film]] returns to reprise their roles, including [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Ernie Sabella]] as the voices of Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Timon and Pumbaa]] watch [[The Lion King|the original film]] in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to their scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory, going back to before the beginning of the movie.\n\nTimon is a social outcast in his [[meerkat]] colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his [[List of The Lion King characters#Ma|mother]], Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the death of his [[List of The Lion King characters#Uncle Max|Uncle Max]] by [[List of The Lion King characters#Scar|Scar]]'s hyena minions [[List of The Lion King characters#Shenzi.2C Banzai and Ed|Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]]. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets the mandrill [[Rafiki (The Lion King)|Rafiki]], who teaches him about \"[[Hakuna Matata]]\" and advises him to \"look beyond what you see\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon.\n\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of [[Simba]] to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas due to his fear of crowds, causing nearby animals to faint, but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\", Mufasa's fight with the hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa, and are thrown off a waterfall in their attempt to escape. \n\nPumbaa then briefly pauses the movie to go refill his popcorn and Timon patiently waits for him. \n\nExhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle he tried to tell Timon about earlier. They finally settle there with the philosophy of Hakuna Matata.\n\nEventually, Timon and Pumbaa encounter Simba in a nearby desert, nearly dead. They rescue him and decide to raise him under their philosophy. Years later, [[List of The Lion King characters#Nala|Nala]] appears and reunites with Simba after chasing and mistaking Pumbaa for food. Believing Hakuna Matata to be in jeopardy, Timon and Pumbaa attempt to sabotage their dates, but fail every time. After they witness Simba and Nala's argument, Simba disappears. Nala explains that he had run off to challenge Scar and reclaim Pride Rock, so that they need their help. Upset that Simba left them, Timon unsuccessfully tries to persuade Pumbaa to stay, but Pumbaa follows Simba and Nala. Timon indulges in the jungle's luxuries by himself, but loneliness starts to overcome him. Rafiki appears again and indirectly helps Timon realize that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves, prompting Timon to take off after Pumbaa, Simba and Nala.\n\nTimon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa, before they journey onward to Pride Rock. After helping Simba and Nala distract the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max, who came looking for Timon, who introduces Pumbaa to them. Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of Scar and the hyenas. While Simba battles Scar, Ma and Uncle Max are directed to construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas, as at the same time, Timon and Pumbaa use various tactics to distract them while the tunnel is being made. When the tunnels are finished, Max knocks down the support beams, breaking the ground under the hyenas. However, the last few get jammed, prompting Timon to dive underground and break them himself. The cave-in commences, and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels in time to confront Scar and kill him. Simba accepts his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands, thanking Timon and Pumbaa for his help. Timon takes Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max, and the meerkat colony to live in the predator-free jungle to complete his Hakuna Matata, and he is praised as their hero.\n\nOnce the story finishes, Ma, Uncle Max, Simba, Rafiki, and eventually many other Disney characters join Timon and Pumbaa to rewind the film in the theater in which Pumbaa tells Timon that he 'still doesn't do well in crowds'.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa#Timon|Timon]], a [[meerkat]] who is Pumbaa's best friend. Though somewhat selfish, arrogant, and withdrawn, Timon shows courageous loyalty towards his friends.

Bob Baxter served as the supervising animator for Pumbaa.\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Simba]], Mufasa and Sarabi's son, Scar's nephew, Nala's husband and the current King of the Pride Lands.\n**Matt Weinberg voices Simba as a cub replacing [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]]. \n* [[Julie Kavner]] as [[List of The Lion King characters#Ma|Ma]], Timon's caring mother.

He initially doubts Timon's ability, but warms up to him at the film's climax. \n* [[Moira Kelly]] as [[Nala (Disney)|Nala]], Simba's childhood friend and eventual wife.

It was developed by [[de Havilland Propellers]] (later [[Hawker Siddeley]]) in the early 1950s and was the first such weapon to enter active service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Fleet Air Arm]], equipping the [[English Electric Lightning]], [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Gloster Javelin]]. It was a [[Tail-chase engagement|rear-aspect]], [[fire and forget]] pursuit weapon, with a field of attack of 20 degrees either side of the target.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 33\">Gibson 2007, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Firestreak was the third heat-seeking missile to enter service, after the US [[AIM-4 Falcon]] and [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], both of which entered service the previous year. In comparison to those designs, the Firestreak was larger and almost twice as heavy, carrying a much larger warhead. It had otherwise similar performance in terms of speed and range.\n\nLimitations of the design led to an improved version, the [[Red Top (missile)|Hawker Siddeley Red Top]], but this never completely replaced Firestreak. Firestreak remained in service until 1988, when it was retired along with the last RAF Lightnings.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ee lightning t4 xm974 arp.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning T4 trainer with a dummy Firestreak missile [[Dummy round|drill round]] (1964)]]\n===Red Hawk===\nFirestreak was the result of a series of projects begun with the OR.1056 [[Red Hawk missile]], which called for an all-aspect seeker that could attack a target from any launch position. When this proved too ambitious for the [[state of the art]], another specification lacking the all-aspect requirement was released as '''Blue Sky''', which developed as [[Fireflash]].\n\n===Blue Jay===\nRed Hawk continued in its original form for a time before it too was rewritten as a lower-performance specification that was released in 1951 as OR.1117, and given the [[Ministry of Supply]] [[rainbow code]]name '''Blue Jay'''.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 33\"/>\n\nBlue Jay developed as a fairly conventional-looking missile with cropped delta wings mounted just aft of the midpoint and small rectangular control surfaces in tandem towards the rear. Internally, things were considerably more complex. The rear-mounted controls were operated by nose-mounted actuators via long pushrods. The actuators were powered by compressed air from bottles at the rear.\n\nThe [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) IR seeker was mounted under an eight-faceted conical [[arsenic trisulphide]] \"pencil\" nose and was cooled to {{convert|-180|C|F}} by [[anhydrous ammonia]] to improve the [[signal to noise ratio]]. The unusual faceted nose was chosen when a more conventional hemispherical nose proved prone to ice accretion.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 34\">Gibson 2007, p. 34</ref> There were two rows of triangular windows in bands around the forward fuselage, behind which sat the optical [[proximity fuze]]s for the warhead. The warhead was at the rear of the missile, wrapped around the exhaust of the Magpie rocket.\n\nThe electronics, made from [[vacuum tube]]s, generated significant heat. For this reason, the Firestreak missile undergoing a ground test was cooled by [[Freon|Arcton]], and in flight by [[ammonia]] pumped through the missile from the parent aircraft.\n\n==Service==\nThe first airborne launch of Blue Jay took place in 1955 from a [[de Havilland Venom]], the [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|target drone]] - a [[Fairey Firefly]] - being destroyed.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 34\"/> '''Blue Jay Mk.1''' entered service in 1957 with the RAF, where it was named Firestreak. Firestreak was deployed by the Royal Navy and the RAF in August 1958;<ref name=Boyne267/> it was the first effective British air-to-air missile.<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref>\n\nFor launch, the missile seeker was slaved to the launch aircraft's radar ([[Ferranti]] [[AIRPASS]] in the Lightning and [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was achieved and the weapon was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 35\">Gibson 2007, p. 35</ref> A downside was that the missile was highly toxic (due to either the ''Magpie'' rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, ...

The '''Blue Jay Mk.2''' included the more powerful Magpie II motor and a PbTe seeker which offered better detection capabilities. '''Blue Jay Mk.3''' had an increased wingspan and reduced performance motor. The derated motor was intended to limit acceleration when launched from supersonic rocket-powered interceptors such as the [[Saunders-Roe SR.177]] and [[Avro 720]], where the additional speed imparted by the Magpie II would have given it a maximum speed so high it would suffer from adverse aerodynamic heating.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\nLooking for an improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with '''Blue Jay Mk.4''', which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''. This adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk.2, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the \"Violet Banner\" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}} Work on Mk.4 was curtailed after 1956 as the RAE decided that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while still within the range of its seeker.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nIn August 1956, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] took over development of the Blue Jay line with '''Blue Jay Mk.5''', replacing the IR seeker with a [[semi-active radar homing]] (SARH) system intended to be used with the [[De Havilland Sea Vixen]]'s AI.18 radar with a special continual wave illuminator mode. This was otherwise identical to Mk.4, differing only by replacing its seeker section with a longer [[Nose cone design#Spherically blunted tangent ogive|ogive nose code]] holding the radar receiver antenna. Problems fitting the illuminator antenna to the Sea Vixen ended work on this project. In November 1957 it was briefly restarted under the name Blue Dolphin as other radar-guided developments ended, but this was never deployed.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n==Red Top==\n{{main|Red Top (missile)}}\nAfter the fallout of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]] led to the cancellation of the F.155 and many other interceptor projects, the [[English Electric Lightning]] was allowed to continue largely because development was almost complete. This left it with no modern weapon, so Blue Vesta was reactivated in a slightly modified form.<ref name=Boyne267/> In November 1957, paperwork with the Blue Vesta name on it was considered disclosed and the project was assigned the new name \"Red Top\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to the Mk.4 there were several important changes. The motor was further upgraded from the Magpie III to the new Linnet which offered significantly higher performance and boosted the typical top speed of the missile from Mach 2.4 to 3.2 whilst almost doubling effective range to {{convert|7.5|miles}}. The adoption of [[transistor]]ized circuits in place of the former [[Vacuum tubes|thermionic valve]]s eliminated the need for cooling the electronics, making the entire guidance section smaller. This allowed the warhead to be moved from its former position near the tail to the midsection, which also allowed it to grow in size and weight, replacing the former blast-fragmentation type with an expanding-rod system that was significantly deadlier. This also allowed the steering fin actuators to be placed at the rear of the missile, eliminating the pushrods and their associated complexity.\n\nGiven the elimination of the ammonia cooling, which was also used by the Violet Banner seeker of the Mk.4, the decision was made to use a simplified seeker that did not require cooling. This led to a new [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) design that was cooled with purified air at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} filtered to 3&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]]. This reduced its sensitivity compared to Violet Banner, lacking its true all-aspect ability, but further simplified the design and eliminated ground handling concerns.\n\nNever given its own name by the RAF, the new design entered service in 1964 as Red Top. It was faster and had a longer range than Firestreak,<ref name=Boyne267/> and \"was capable of all aspect homing against super-sonic targets.\"<ref name=Boyne267/> Despite Red Top being intended to replace Firestreak, Firestreak remained in limited service until the final retirement of the Lightning in 1988; the carriage of these missiles improved the aircraft's aerodynamics.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Firestreak operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Firestreak operators in blue]]\n[[File:Firestreak AAM - Elvington - BB.jpg|thumb|A Firestreak on its trolley.

It was developed by [[de Havilland Propellers]] (later [[Hawker Siddeley]]) in the early 1950s and was the first such weapon to enter active service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Fleet Air Arm]], equipping the [[English Electric Lightning]], [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] and [[Gloster Javelin]]. It was a [[Tail-chase engagement|rear-aspect]], [[fire and forget]] pursuit weapon, with a field of attack of 20 degrees either side of the target.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 33\">Gibson 2007, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Firestreak was the third heat seeking missile to enter service, after the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] and [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], both of which entered service the previous year. In comparison to those designs, the Firestreak was larger and almost twice as heavy, carrying a much larger warhead. It had otherwise similar performance in terms of speed and range. Limitations of the design led to an improved version, the [[Red Top (missile)|Hawker Siddeley Red Top]], but this never completely replaced Firestreak. Firestreak remained in service until 1988, when it was retired along with the last RAF Lightnings.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ee lightning t4 xm974 arp.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning T4 trainer with a dummy Firestreak missile [[Dummy round|drill round]] (1964)]]\n===Red Hawk===\nFirestreak was the result of a series of projects begun with the OR.1056 [[Red Hawk missile]], which called for an all-aspect seeker that could attack a target from any launch position. When this proved too ambitious for the [[state of the art]], another specification lacking the all-aspect requirement was released as '''Blue Sky''', which developed as [[Fireflash]].\n\n===Blue Jay===\nRed Hawk continued in its original form for a time before it too was rewritten as a lower-performance specification that was released in 1951 as OR.1117, and given the [[Ministry of Supply]] [[rainbow code]]name '''Blue Jay'''.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 33\"/>\n\nBlue Jay developed as a fairly conventional-looking missile with cropped delta wings mounted just aft of the midpoint and small rectangular control surfaces in tandem towards the rear. Internally, things were considerably more complex. The rear-mounted controls were operated by nose-mounted actuators via long pushrods. The actuators were powered by compressed air from bottles at the rear.\n\nThe [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) IR seeker was mounted under an eight-faceted conical [[arsenic trisulphide]] \"pencil\" nose and was cooled to {{convert|-180|C|F}} by [[anhydrous ammonia]] to improve the [[signal to noise ratio]]. The unusual faceted nose was chosen when a more conventional hemispherical nose proved prone to ice accretion.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 34\">Gibson 2007, p. 34</ref> There were two rows of triangular windows in bands around the forward fuselage, behind which sat the optical [[proximity fuze]]s for the warhead. The warhead was at the rear of the missile, wrapped around the exhaust of the Magpie rocket.\n\nThe electronics, made from [[vacuum tube]]s, generated significant heat. For this reason, the Firestreak missile undergoing a ground test was cooled by [[Freon|Arcton]], and in flight by [[ammonia]] pumped through the missile from the parent aircraft.\n\n==Service==\nThe first airborne launch of Blue Jay took place in 1955 from a [[de Havilland Venom]], the [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|target drone]] - a [[Fairey Firefly]] - being destroyed.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 34\"/> '''Blue Jay Mk.1''' entered service in 1957 with the RAF, where it was named Firestreak. Firestreak was deployed by the Royal Navy and the RAF in August 1958;<ref name=Boyne267/> it was the first effective British air-to-air missile.<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref>\n\nFor launch, the missile seeker was slaved to the launch aircraft's radar ([[Ferranti]] [[AIRPASS]] in the Lightning and [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was achieved and the weapon was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target.<ref name=\"Gibson 2007, p. 35\">Gibson 2007, p. 35</ref> A downside was that the missile was highly toxic (due to either the ''Magpie'' rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, ...

The Fatimids launched an expedition east, against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], under the [[Berbers|Berber]] general [[Habasa ibn Yusuf]]. Habasa succeeded in subduing the cities on the [[Libya]]n coast between Ifriqiya and [[Egypt]], and captured [[Alexandria]]. The Fatimid heir-apparent, [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah]], then arrived to take over the campaign. Attempts to conquer the Egyptian capital, [[Fustat]], were beaten back by the Abbasid troops in the province. A risky affair even at the outset, the arrival of Abbasid reinforcements from Syria and Iraq under [[Mu'nis al-Muzaffar]] doomed the invasion to failure, and al-Qa'im and the remnants of his army abandoned Alexandria and returned to Ifriqiya in May 915. The failure did not prevent the Fatimids from launching [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|another unsuccessful attempt]] to capture Egypt four years later. It was not until 969 that the Fatimids [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|conquered Egypt]] and made it the centre of their empire.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Fatimids]] came to power in Ifriqiya in 909, when they overthrew the reigning [[Aghlabid]] dynasty with the support of the [[Kutama]] [[Berbers]]. In contrast to their predecessors, who were content to remain a regional dynasty on the western fringes of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the Fatimids held ecumenical pretensions. As leaders of an [[Isma'ili]] [[Shi'a]] sect and claiming descent from [[Fatimah|Fatima]], the daughter of [[Muhammad]] and wife of [[Ali]], they regarded the [[Sunni]] Abbasids as usurpers and were determined to overthrow them and take their place. Thus in early 910 the Fatimid ruler Ubayd Allah declared himself [[imam]] and [[caliph]] as \"[[al-Mahdi Billah]]\" ({{reign|909|934}}).{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=313\u2013314}}\n\nIn line with this imperial vision, following the establishment of their rule in Ifriqiya, the Fatimids' next objective was [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]], the gateway to the [[Levant]] and [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]], the seat of their Abbasid rivals.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=192}} The direct route from Ifriqiya to Egypt led through modern [[Libya]]. Apart from the few cities on the coast\u2014[[Tripoli]] in the west and the cities of [[Cyrenaica]] in the east\u2014this was a country dominated by [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes\u2014from west to east the [[Nafusa]], [[Hawwara]], [[Mazata]] and [[Luwata]]\u2014which during the previous centuries had been Islamicized, although incompletely; thus the Nafusa were still [[Kharijites]], while the Mazata were Muslim in name only. Only in Cyrenaica and to the east did there exist true Arab [[Bedouin]], who had migrated there in the 9th century.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=180\u2013181}} \n\nThe Fatimids entered the area in 911, when Kutama chieftains raided up to the territories of the Luwata. Around Tripoli, which had submitted after the fall of the Aghlabids, the Hawwara tribesmen quickly came to resent the overbearing behaviour of the Fatimids' Kutama soldiery, as well as their heavy tax demands. A first uprising and siege of the city in 910\u2013911 was followed by a general revolt in summer 912, which also engulfed the city. The Fatimid governor fled, and all Kutama were slaughtered. The Fatimid heir-apparent, [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah]] led a combined land and naval expedition against the Hawwara. After Tripoli capitulated in June 913, al-Qa'im left one of the principal Kutama generals, [[Habasa ibn Yusuf]], there, to prepare the further eastward expansion of the Fatimid empire.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=161\u2013162, 182}} \n\nAfter coming to power in Ifriqiya, al-Mahdi Billah also entertained hopes of a pincer movement against Egypt from two sides, as the pro-Fatimid propaganda had in the previous years managed to take over most of the [[Yemen]] under the leadership of [[Ibn Hawshab]] and [[Ali ibn al-Fadl]]. But in late 911, Ibn al-Fadl denounced al-Mahdi as a fraud, and attacked his former companion Ibn Hawshab, who had remained loyal to the Fatimid ruler. Although both died shortly after, their conflict weakened the Fatimid position in the Yemen, allowing the pro-Abbasid [[Yufirids]] to regain much lost ground, and thwarted any hopes of a simultaneous attack on Egypt from the southeast.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=176\u2013180}} \n\n==Invasion of Egypt==\nThe 15th-century Isma'ili (and thus pro-Fatimid) historian, [[Idris Imad al-Din]], provides the most detail about the expedition against Egypt, and is complemented by Sunni sources such as [[al-Tabari]] and [[al-Kindi]], who write from the opposite side.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=186, 187}} \n\n===Conquest of the Cyrenaica===\n{{Location map+ | Libya\n| width = 300\n| caption = Sites of the campaign in Libya\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Tripoli\n    | lat_deg = 32 | lat_min = 53.14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 11.29 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Sirte\n    | lat_deg = 31 | lat_min = 5.33 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 17 | lon_min = 23.54 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Ajdabiya\n    | lat_deg = 30 | lat_min = 45.20 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 20 | lon_min = 13.31 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Barqa\n    | lat_deg = 32 | lat_min = 29.54 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 20 | lon_min = 53.34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n}}\nThe expedition against Egypt was launched on 24 January 914, when the army under Habasa ibn Yusuf departed Tripoli. The Fatimid army took the coastal route. The Abbasid garrisons of [[Sirte]] and [[Ajdabiya]] abandoned these towns without battle, and on 6 February Habasa entered [[Barca (ancient city)|Barqa]], the capital of Cyrenaica and the \"gateway of Egypt\".{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=187}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=182}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=30, 31}} The conquest of Cyrenaica promised to be beneficial to the Fatimid treasury: the land tax (''[[kharaj]]'') brought in 24,000 [[gold dinar]]s to the Abbasids annually, with another 15,000 dinars provided by the ''[[jizya]]'' paid by the Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'', the ''[[zakat]]'', and the ''[[ushr]]''.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=182}}\n\nAccording to Imad al-Din, Barqa was evacuated without battle.

In September 914, the first Syrian troops began arriving in Fustat.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} In October, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Muqtadir]] appointed his chamberlain [[Mu'nis al-Muzaffar|Mu'nis]] as commander-in-chief and ordered him to Egypt.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=185}} To support the expedition, and alleviate the financial burden on the Egyptian populace of the expeditionary force, two million silver ''[[dirham]]'' were allocated by the treasury.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}}\n\n===March on Fustat and first battle at Giza===\nIn early December, as the [[Nile floods]] withdrew and allowed the passage of armies along the river, the Fatimid army set out for Fustat in two columns: Habasa ahead, with al-Qa'im following behind.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} As Fustat lay on the eastern bank of the Nile, and the only way to cross to it was by the [[pontoon bridge]] to [[Rawda Island]] and Giza, Takin al-Khazari mobilized the garrison and the inhabitants of the city and set up a fortified camp at Giza.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}}\n\nOn 13 December, the first alarm was raised in Fustat, with anyone able to bear arms rushing over the bridge, but no attack ensued. This was repeated the next day, and only on the day after did the Fatimids attack. In the ensuing battle, the Abbasid forces prevailed, as Takin's [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] [[horse-archers]] inflicted heavy casualties on the Kutama [[lancers]].

On 8 January 915, in a large-scale battle at Giza, the Fatimids were decisively defeated; Fatimid sources unanimously attribute this defeat to Habasa, who fled the battlefield, despite al-Qa'im's exhortations to stand firm. The pro-Fatimid accounts maintain that al-Qa'im launched three attacks on the enemy and caused many casualties, but these embellishments cannot hide the fact that the battle was a disaster: with his army collapsing, al-Qa'im retreated to Alexandria, which he entered on 23 January.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=185}}\n\n===Fatimid withdrawal from Alexandria and revolt in Cyrenaica===\nDespite the setback, in his letters to his father, and the surviving sermons that he delivered in Alexandria, al-Qa'im appears not to have lost confidence in his ultimate success.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=185\u2013186}} For a while he also engaged in negotiations with some Egyptian defectors, who asked for ''am\u0101n'' from al-Qa'im, and raised the prospect of the capitulation of Fustat.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} It appears that al-Qa'im himself was not entirely convinced of the sincerity of such proposals, which became impossible when the Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis arrived at Fustat in April 915.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=141}} Mu'nis dismissed Takin and replaced him with [[Dhuka al-Rumi]].{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} \n\nSoon after, Habasa with thirty of his closest followers deserted al-Qa'im and made for Ifriqiya; alarmed by this, al-Qa'im evacuated Alexandria hastily and without battle, leaving much of his armament and equipment behind.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} Dhuka occupied the city and installed a strong garrison under his son al-Muzzafar, before returning to Fustat to mete out punishment to those elements suspected of corresponding with al-Qa'im.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} Al-Qa'im arrived at Raqqada on 28 May 915. In his rear, Cyrenaica rose in revolt and overthrew Fatimid control; in Barqa, the entire Kutama garrison was killed.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} The rebellion was only suppressed in 917, after an 18-month siege of Barqa.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=31}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=188}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThe invasion was costly in blood on both sides: 7,000 Fatimid troops were killed and another 7,000 were taken prisoner in the first round of fighting alone, while in the second round, Habasa's troops are said to have lost 10,000 men killed. Losses among the conscripted Egyptian population range from 10,000 to 20,000 dead, while Imad al-Din put the total number of Egyptians killed as high as 50,000.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=188, 189}}\n\nBoth sides suffered from indiscipline and lack of cohesion in their ranks. Habasa repeatedly acted without consulting al-Qa'im, and committed several atrocities against civilians; his abandonment of the battlefield doomed the expedition, and on his return to Ifriqiya, he was executed.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=189}} Several Fatimid troops defected, while al-Qa'im too had to struggle to impose discipline on his men, who looted the Fayyum.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=189}} The Abbasid side also experienced defections, quarrels among their commanders, as well as the willingness of many Egyptians to come to terms with the Fatimid invader, leading to brutal reprisals by the Abbasid authorities against those who corresponded with al-Qa'im.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=189\u2013190}} \n\nHowever, in strategic terms it was the failure of the Fatimids to capture Fustat that determined their failure. Fustat was the main administrative and urban centre of the country, and, as the historian Yaacov Lev points out, the \"key to the conquest of Egypt\": of the several invasions of Egypt in the 10th century, only these that captured the capital were successful, even if large parts of the country itself were not yet subdued.{{sfn|Lev|1979|p=320}}\n\nThe Fatimid expedition was considered risky even at the time. The Fatimids' rule in Ifriqiya was still not secure and was plagued by constant rebellions; the [[Fatimid navy]] had been destroyed in 913 during such a revolt by the governor of [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=191}} The 10th-century Fatimid propagandist [[al-Qadi al-Nu'man]] even reports that al-Qa'im was reluctant to embark on the expedition, and argued with his father in favour of delaying it.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=191}} According to Michael Brett, the Fatimid invasion failed chiefly \"because the expedition found itself deep in the interior of the country, on the desert bank of the Nile across the river from the Egyptian capital, confronted by a garrison which had been able to call upon the forces of the empire at its back\".{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=146}} The precariousness of the first Fatimid invasion becomes even clearer when contrasted with the elaborate military preparations and infiltration of the country by Fatimid agents undertaken for several years before its [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|final conquest in 969]].{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBased on a passage in the history of [[Ibn Khaldun]], the Dutch [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Michael Jan de Goeje]], who first studied the [[Qarmatians]] of [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]], an offshoot branch of the same movement that gave rise to the Fatimids, suggested the existence of a covert alliance between the two, and of a coordinated plan of attack against the Abbasids, with the Qarmatians attacking from their bases close to the Abbasid metropolitan region of [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]], and the Fatimids from the west. Indeed the Qarmatians raided the environs of [[Basra]] in 913, but their forces were weak, and any notion of a coordinated offensive is belied by the fact that they remained inactive when the actual Fatimid invasion of Egypt took place, as they did during the second Fatimid invasion a few years later. Furthermore, more recent analysis of the origins of the Fatimid\u2013Qarmatian schism has demonstrated the deep-seated doctrinal differences and hostility between the two Isma'ili branches, and the fundamentally anti-Fatimid disposition of the Qarmatians.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=22\u201323, 29ff.}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe expedition's failure rocked the fundaments of Fatimid regime: the belief in the divine mission of the Imam-Caliph was shaken, and discontent arose, particularly among the Kutama sub-tribe of the Malusa, from whom Habasa, now hounded as a criminal, originated.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=187\u2013188}} His eventual capture and imprisonment led to the revolt of his brother Ghazwiyya, who had played a crucial role in securing al-Mahdi's regime up to that point, and who had recently been given charge of the entire Kutama country to the west of Ifriqiya. The revolt was quickly crushed, however, and Ghazwiyya and Habasa were executed. When their heads were brought before al-Mahdi, he is said to have exclaimed \"Once did these heads enclose the East and West; and now they are contained within this basket!\".{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=188}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nDespite their failure, the Fatimids launched a [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|second invasion in 919]], which was also defeated.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=31\u201332}} Apart from a brief intervention in the internal conflicts of the military factions in Egypt in 935, it was not until 969 that another serious invasion was undertaken.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=193}} By then, the Abbasid Caliphate, weakened by constant power struggles between rival bureaucratic, court, and military factions, and deprived of its outlying provinces to ambitious local dynasts, had ceased to exist as a political entity, with the Abbasid caliphs a powerless pawn of the [[Buyids]];{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=185\u2013197}} while the Fatimid regime had grown stronger and far more wealthy, and now disposed of a large and disciplined army.

The Fatimids launched an expedition east, against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], under the [[Berbers|Berber]] general [[Habasa ibn Yusuf]]. Habasa succeeded in subduing the cities on the [[Libya]]n coast between Ifriqiya and [[Egypt]], and captured [[Alexandria]]. The Fatimid heir-apparent, [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah]], then arrived to take over the campaign. Attempts to conquer the Egyptian capital, [[Fustat]], were beaten back by the Abbasid troops in the province. A risky affair even at the outset, the arrival of Abbasid reinforcements from Syria and Iraq under [[Mu'nis al-Muzaffar]] doomed the invasion to failure, and al-Qa'im and the remnants of his army abandoned Alexandria and returned to Ifriqiya in May 915. The failure did not prevent the Fatimids from launching [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|another unsuccessful attempt]] to capture Egypt four years later. It was not until 969 that the Fatimids [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|conquered Egypt]] and made it the centre of their empire.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Fatimids]] came to power in Ifriqiya in 909, when they overthrew the reigning [[Aghlabid]] dynasty with the support of the [[Kutama]] [[Berbers]]. In contrast to their predecessors, who were content to remain a regional dynasty on the western fringes of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the Fatimids held ecumenical pretensions. As leaders of an [[Isma'ili]] [[Shi'a]] sect and claiming descent from [[Fatimah|Fatima]], the daughter of [[Muhammad]] and wife of [[Ali]], they regarded the [[Sunni]] Abbasids as usurpers and were determined to overthrow them and take their place. Thus in early 910 the Fatimid ruler Ubayd Allah declared himself [[imam]] and [[caliph]] as \"[[al-Mahdi Billah]]\" ({{reign|909|934}}).{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=313\u2013314}}\n\nIn line with this imperial vision, following the establishment of their rule in Ifriqiya, the Fatimids' next objective was [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]], the gateway to the [[Levant]] and [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]], the seat of their Abbasid rivals.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=192}} The direct route from Ifriqiya to Egypt led through modern [[Libya]]. Apart from the few cities on the coast\u2014[[Tripoli]] in the west and the cities of [[Cyrenaica]] in the east\u2014this was a country dominated by [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes\u2014from west to east the [[Nafusa]], [[Hawwara]], [[Mazata]] and [[Luwata]]\u2014which during the previous centuries had been Islamicized, although incompletely; thus the Nafusa were still [[Kharijites]], while the Mazata were Muslim in name only. Only in Cyrenaica and to the east did there exist true Arab [[Bedouin]], who had migrated there in the 9th century.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=180\u2013181}} \n\nThe Fatimids entered the area in 911, when Kutama chieftains raided up to the territories of the Luwata. Around Tripoli, which had submitted after the fall of the Aghlabids, the Hawwara tribesmen quickly came to resent the overbearing behaviour of the Fatimids' Kutama soldiery, as well as their heavy tax demands. A first uprising and siege of the city in 910\u2013911 was followed by a general revolt in summer 912, which also engulfed the city. The Fatimid governor fled, and all Kutama were slaughtered. The Fatimid heir-apparent, [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah]] led a combined land and naval expedition against the Hawwara. After Tripoli capitulated in June 913, al-Qa'im left one of the principal Kutama generals, [[Habasa ibn Yusuf]], there, to prepare the further eastward expansion of the Fatimid empire.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=161\u2013162, 182}} \n\nAfter coming to power in Ifriqiya, al-Mahdi Billah also entertained hopes of a pincer movement against Egypt from two sides, as the pro-Fatimid propaganda had in the previous years managed to take over most of the [[Yemen]] under the leadership of [[Ibn Hawshab]] and [[Ali ibn al-Fadl]]. But in late 911, Ibn al-Fadl denounced al-Mahdi as a fraud, and attacked his former companion Ibn Hawshab, who had remained loyal to the Fatimid ruler. Although both died shortly after, their conflict weakened the Fatimid position in the Yemen, allowing the pro-Abbasid [[Yufirids]] to regain much lost ground, and thwarted any hopes of a simultaneous attack on Egypt from the southeast.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=176\u2013180}} \n\n==Invasion of Egypt==\nThe 15th-century Isma'ili (and thus pro-Fatimid) historian, [[Idris Imad al-Din]], provides the most detail about the expedition against Egypt, and is complemented by Sunni sources such as [[al-Tabari]] and [[al-Kindi]], who write from the opposite side.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=186, 187}} \n\n===Conquest of the Cyrenaica===\n{{Location map+ | Libya\n| width = 300\n| caption = Sites of the campaign in Libya\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Tripoli\n    | lat_deg = 32 | lat_min = 53.14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 11.29 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Sirte\n    | lat_deg = 31 | lat_min = 12.18 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 35.19 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Ajdabiya\n    | lat_deg = 30 | lat_min = 45.20 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 20 | lon_min = 13.31 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Libya\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Barqa\n    | lat_deg = 32 | lat_min = 29.54 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 20 | lon_min = 53.34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n}}\nThe expedition against Egypt was launched on 24 January 914, when the army under Habasa ibn Yusuf departed Tripoli. The Fatimid army took the coastal route. The Abbasid garrisons of [[Sirte]] and [[Ajdabiya]] abandoned these towns without battle, and on 6 February Habasa entered [[Barca (ancient city)|Barqa]], the capital of Cyrenaica and the \"gateway of Egypt\".{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=187}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=182}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=30, 31}} The conquest of Cyrenaica promised to be beneficial to the Fatimid treasury: the land tax (''[[kharaj]]'') brought in 24,000 [[gold dinar]]s to the Abbasids annually, with another 15,000 dinars provided by the ''[[jizya]]'' paid by the Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'', the ''[[zakat]]'', and the ''[[ushr]]''.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=182}}\n\nAccording to Imad al-Din, Barqa was evacuated without battle. Sunni sources claim that the Fatimid troops committed atrocities against the inhabitants and extorted funds from the local merchants.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=187\u2013188}} Thus he forced the local pigeon merchants to roast and eat their ware, suspecting them of using their birds to spy for the Abbasids.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=182}} He urged the members of the local Arab militia (the ''[[jund]]'') to enrol in the Fatimid army, while imposing considerable financial levies on the town's population.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=182\u2013183}} He furthermore executed two chieftains of the Mazata, who nine years before had waylaid and robbed al-Mahdi during his journey to Ifriqiya; their sons were also killed, while their womenfolk were sold into slavery and their possessions confiscated.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}}\n\nNews of the Fatimids' arrival in Barqa provoked the Abbasid authorities in Egypt to send an army against them. Habasa's men, reinforced by fresh troops from Ifriqiya, won the ensuing battle outside the city on 14 March.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}}{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}\n\n===Capture of Alexandria===\n[[File:Gold dinar of al-Qaim, AH 322-334.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Photo of the reverse and obverse sides of a gold coin with Arabic writing|[[Gold dinar]] of [[al-Qa'im (Fatimid caliph)|al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah]], Fatimid caliph in 934\u2013946. As heir-apparent to his father, he led the two early Fatimid invasions of [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]]]\nEncouraged by this success, al-Mahdi sent his son and heir, al-Qa'im, with another army east to assume command of the expedition.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}} At the head of a force comprising numerous Kutama as well as members of the Arab ''jund'' of Ifriqiya, al-Qa'im set out from al-Mahdi's residence at [[Raqqada]] on 11 July. He arrived at Tripoli on 1 August, writing to Habasa to await his coming before invading Egypt proper. Disregarding these orders, however, the ambitious Habasa led his forces into Egypt; after defeating an Abbasid force at al-Hanniya (near modern [[El Alamein]]), on 27 August 914 he entered [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}}{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}} The Kutama raided south along the [[River Nile]] and devastated the country, reaching as far as [[Giza]], across the river from the capital of Egypt, [[Fustat]].{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}} Habasa wrote to the local governor, [[Takin al-Khazari]], offering [[safe-conduct]] (''am\u0101n'') in exchange for his surrender, but Takin refused.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}} Al-Qa'im arrived in Alexandria on 6 November 914, where he imposed the Fatimid [[Adhan|call to prayer]], a Kutama governor, and an Isma'ili ''[[qadi]]'' (judge).{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=183}}{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}\n\nIn the meantime, the arrival of the Fatimid army in Alexandria provoked panic in [[Baghdad]]. The Abbasid government had paid little attention to the affairs of Ifriqiya and the claims of al-Mahdi, but now urgent enquiries were made as to his origin and intentions.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=183\u2013184}} Takin urgently requested reinforcements, and the [[Bilad al-Sham|Syrian]] provinces were mobilized. In September 914, the first Syrian troops began arriving in Fustat.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} In October, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Muqtadir]] appointed his chamberlain [[Mu'nis al-Muzaffar|Mu'nis]] as commander-in-chief and ordered him to Egypt.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=185}} To support the expedition, and alleviate the financial burden on the Egyptian populace of the expeditionary force, two million silver ''[[dirham]]'' were allocated by the treasury.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}}\n\n===March on Fustat and first battle at Giza===\nIn early December, as the [[Nile floods]] withdrew and allowed the passage of armies along the river, the Fatimid army set out for Fustat in two columns: Habasa ahead, with al-Qa'im following behind.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} As Fustat lay on the eastern bank of the Nile, and the only way to cross to it was by the [[pontoon bridge]] to [[Rawda Island]] and Giza, Takin al-Khazari mobilized the garrison and the inhabitants of the city and set up a fortified camp at Giza.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}}\n\nOn 13 December, the first alarm was raised in Fustat, with anyone able to bear arms rushing over the bridge, but no attack ensued. This was repeated the next day, and only on the day after did the Fatimids attack. In the ensuing battle, the Abbasid forces prevailed, as Takin's [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] [[horse-archers]] inflicted heavy casualties on the Kutama [[lancers]]. The Egyptian forces pursued the Kutama into the night, but during the pursuit the inexperienced levies fell into an ambush, saving the Fatimid army from a complete rout.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} The Egyptians remained tense, with another false alarm the next day, but only minor skirmishes occurred during the next few days.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}} Despite this setback, some of the Egyptians (Christian [[Copts]] and Muslims alike) corresponded with al-Qa'im, revealing the continued presence of an element of possible sympathizers and, according to [[Heinz Halm]], possibly the presence of a Fatimid missionary (''[[da'i]]'') in Fustat.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=184}}\n\n===Fatimid occupation of Fayyum and defeat at Giza===\n{{Location map+ | Lower Egypt\n| width = 300\n| caption = Sites of the campaign in [[Lower Egypt]]\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Lower Egypt\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Alexandria\n    | lat_deg = 31  | lat_min = 00 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 29 | lon_min = 55 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~ | Lower Egypt\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Fustat\n    | lat_deg = 30  | lat_min = 00 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 31 | lon_min = 14 | lon_dir = E\n  }}  \n  {{Location map~ | Lower Egypt\n    | marksize = 10\n    | label = Fayyum Oasis\n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = 29  | lat_min = 27.13 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 30 | lon_min = 34.51 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n}}\n\nUnable to cross the river to Fustat, al-Qa'im moved, with a large part of his army, around Takin's defences and into the fertile [[Fayyum Oasis]], where they could find provisions. The Kutama initially plundered the area, but al-Qa'im restored order and imposed a regular tax regime on the inhabitants.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=184\u2013185}} \n\nAt this point, al-Qa'im and Habasa, who had remained behind in command of the bulk of the Fatimid army at Giza, fell out when al-Qa'im ordered Habasa replaced. On 8 January 915, in a large-scale battle at Giza, the Fatimids were decisively defeated; Fatimid sources unanimously attribute this defeat to Habasa, who fled the battlefield, despite al-Qa'im's exhortations to stand firm. The pro-Fatimid accounts maintain that al-Qa'im launched three attacks on the enemy and caused many casualties, but these embellishments cannot hide the fact that the battle was a disaster: with his army collapsing, al-Qa'im retreated to Alexandria, which he entered on 23 January.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=185}}\n\n===Fatimid withdrawal from Alexandria and revolt in Cyrenaica===\nDespite the setback, in his letters to his father, and the surviving sermons that he delivered in Alexandria, al-Qa'im appears not to have lost confidence in his ultimate success.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=185\u2013186}} For a while he also engaged in negotiations with some Egyptian defectors, who asked for ''am\u0101n'' from al-Qa'im, and raised the prospect of the capitulation of Fustat.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} It appears that al-Qa'im himself was not entirely convinced of the sincerity of such proposals, which became impossible when the Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis arrived at Fustat in April 915.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=141}} Mu'nis dismissed Takin and replaced him with [[Dhuka al-Rumi]].{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} \n\nSoon after, Habasa with thirty of his closest followers deserted al-Qa'im and made for Ifriqiya; alarmed by this, al-Qa'im evacuated Alexandria hastily and without battle, leaving much of his armament and equipment behind.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} Dhuka occupied the city and installed a strong garrison under his son al-Muzzafar, before returning to Fustat to mete out punishment to those elements suspected of corresponding with al-Qa'im.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} Al-Qa'im arrived at Raqqada on 28 May 915. In his rear, Cyrenaica rose in revolt and overthrew Fatimid control; in Barqa, the entire Kutama garrison was killed.{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=187}} The rebellion was only suppressed in 917, after an 18-month siege of Barqa.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|p=31}}{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=188}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThe invasion was costly in blood on both sides: 7,000 Fatimid troops were killed and another 7,000 were taken prisoner in the first round of fighting alone, while in the second round, Habasa's troops are said to have lost 10,000 men killed. Losses among the conscripted Egyptian population range from 10,000 to 20,000 dead, while Imad al-Din put the total number of Egyptians killed as high as 50,000.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=188, 189}}\n\nBoth sides suffered from indiscipline and lack of cohesion in their ranks. Habasa repeatedly acted without consulting al-Qa'im, and committed several atrocities against civilians; his abandonment of the battlefield doomed the expedition, and on his return to Ifriqiya, he was executed.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=189}} Several Fatimid troops defected, while al-Qa'im too had to struggle to impose discipline on his men, who looted the Fayyum.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=189}} The Abbasid side also experienced defections, quarrels among their commanders, as well as the willingness of many Egyptians to come to terms with the Fatimid invader, leading to brutal reprisals by the Abbasid authorities against those who corresponded with al-Qa'im.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=189\u2013190}} \n\nHowever, in strategic terms it was the failure of the Fatimids to capture Fustat that determined their failure. Fustat was the main administrative and urban centre of the country, and, as the historian Yaacov Lev points out, the \"key to the conquest of Egypt\": of the several invasions of Egypt in the 10th century, only these that captured the capital were successful, even if large parts of the country itself were not yet subdued.{{sfn|Lev|1979|p=320}}\n\nThe Fatimid expedition was considered risky even at the time. The Fatimids' rule in Ifriqiya was still not secure and was plagued by constant rebellions; the [[Fatimid navy]] had been destroyed in 913 during such a revolt by the governor of [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=191}} The 10th-century Fatimid propagandist [[al-Qadi al-Nu'man]] even reports that al-Qa'im was reluctant to embark on the expedition, and argued with his father in favour of delaying it.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=191}} According to Michael Brett, the Fatimid invasion failed chiefly \"because the expedition found itself deep in the interior of the country, on the desert bank of the Nile across the river from the Egyptian capital, confronted by a garrison which had been able to call upon the forces of the empire at its back\".{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=146}} The precariousness of the first Fatimid invasion becomes even clearer when contrasted with the elaborate military preparations and infiltration of the country by Fatimid agents undertaken for several years before its [[Fatimid conquest of Egypt|final conquest in 969]].{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nBased on a passage in the history of [[Ibn Khaldun]], the Dutch [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Michael Jan de Goeje]], who first studied the [[Qarmatians]] of [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]], an offshoot branch of the same movement that gave rise to the Fatimids, suggested the existence of a covert alliance between the two, and of a coordinated plan of attack against the Abbasids, with the Qarmatians attacking from their bases close to the Abbasid metropolitan region of [[Iraq (region)|Iraq]], and the Fatimids from the west. Indeed the Qarmatians raided the environs of [[Basra]] in 913, but their forces were weak, and any notion of a coordinated offensive is belied by the fact that they remained inactive when the actual Fatimid invasion of Egypt took place, as they did during the second Fatimid invasion a few years later. Furthermore, more recent analysis of the origins of the Fatimid\u2013Qarmatian schism has demonstrated the deep-seated doctrinal differences and hostility between the two Isma'ili branches, and the fundamentally anti-Fatimid disposition of the Qarmatians.{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=22\u201323, 29ff.}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe expedition's failure rocked the fundaments of Fatimid regime: the belief in the divine mission of the Imam-Caliph was shaken, and discontent arose, particularly among the Kutama sub-tribe of the Malusa, from whom Habasa, now hounded as a criminal, originated.{{sfn|Halm|1991|pp=187\u2013188}} His eventual capture and imprisonment led to the revolt of his brother Ghazwiyya, who had played a crucial role in securing al-Mahdi's regime up to that point, and who had recently been given charge of the entire Kutama country to the west of Ifriqiya. The revolt was quickly crushed, however, and Ghazwiyya and Habasa were executed. When their heads were brought before al-Mahdi, he is said to have exclaimed \"Once did these heads enclose the East and West; and now they are contained within this basket!\".{{sfn|Halm|1991|p=188}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nDespite their failure, the Fatimids launched a [[Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919\u2013921)|second invasion in 919]], which was also defeated.{{sfn|Lev|1988|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Madelung|1996|pp=31\u201332}} Apart from a brief intervention in the internal conflicts of the military factions in Egypt in 935, it was not until 969 that another serious invasion was undertaken.{{sfn|Lev|1988|p=193}} By then, the Abbasid Caliphate, weakened by constant power struggles between rival bureaucratic, court, and military factions, and deprived of its outlying provinces to ambitious local dynasts, had ceased to exist as a political entity, with the Abbasid caliphs a powerless pawn of the [[Buyids]];{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=185\u2013197}} while the Fatimid regime had grown stronger and far more wealthy, and now disposed of a large and disciplined army.

Developers are bound by a government design code to ensure architectural cohesion.\n\n==Concept==\nFairford Leys is an estate consisting of 1,900 homes, on the western edge of [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]], England. It has its own centre, centred around a square, hosting a number of traditionally fronted shops, award-winning hair salon, supermarket, three restaurants, a [[Nursery school|nursery]], an [[ecumenical]] [[Church (building)|church]] and a community centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coldharbour-pc.gov.uk/fairford-leys-history/|title=Fairford Leys History {{!}} ColdharBour Parish Council|website=www.coldharbour-pc.gov.uk|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> It also has a private health club with [[swimming pool]] which opened in October 2003.  The [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] for Fairford Leys is '''Coldharbour''' which is an [[Aylesbury Vale]] district.  Its northern portion is home to a modern industrial area.\n\nThe development is an example of an [[urban village]], which is a town planning concept started in the UK in the late 1990s, with its roots in [[new urbanism]] and garden city ideals. The emphasis for this type of development is to focus on pedestrians over cars and other forms of community interaction. Fairford Leys is one of the first examples of a development planned using a [[Design Code]], championed by [[John Prescott]] and the Labour government of the late 1990s. The aim of the code was to create an urban village development and it sets out design rules during, and also after, the construction phase, to ensure the individual developers all build to the same standard and to create cohesion to the design and appearance of the development as a whole. The driving force behind this was the original landowner, the [[Ernest Cook Trust]]. The [[architecture]] is inspired by traditional Aylesbury housing styles and pastiche [[Victorian era|Victorian]] lamp posts and railings. The centre of the estate is surrounded by the \"city wall\", a concept originating from the masterplanner [[John Simpson (architect)|John Simpson]] and inspired by medieval city walls, such as York. This consists of three- and four-storey townhouses and the main entrance to the centre is marked by two towers, loosely modelled on medieval [[gate tower]]s.\n\nDevelopments in Fairford Leys are controlled by the 16-page guidelines, which are a summary of some of the important aspects of the original Design Code. They govern the look and materials used in several aspects of construction, including roof materials, chimneys, window materials, front boundary fences and planting, and front door colours.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/06/new-build-britain-john-harris-housing|title=Welcome to Toytown: what life is like in new-build Britain|last=Harris|first=John|date=2013-04-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>  \n\nThe centre contains a higher density of housing, with larger [[detached]] properties at the edge of the estate. Originally the design included play areas, open spaces, [[playing fields]] and a [[golf course]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The golf course has since been closed and fenced off due to the route of the impending HS2 crossing the area.\n\n==Facilities==\nFairford Leys has its own [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] (Coldharbour Parish), [[primary school]], [[General Practitioner|GPs']] practice and neighbouring [[pharmacy]], [[veterinary]] practice, [[Women's Institute]], [[Local ecumenical partnership|ecumenical church]], and a [[community centre]] (known as the Fairford Leys Centre), which hosts a wide variety of events and activities, including dance classes, badminton, karate, children's parties, wedding receptions, corporate functions and council meetings. The main centre was officially opened in November 2004.\n\n==Education==\nSt Mary's Church of England School is a mixed, [[voluntary controlled]], primary school, which has about 320 pupils from the ages of four to 11. It was purpose built for the Fairford Leys estate but the education authority (Bucks County Council) underestimated the number of children that would live within the Estate.
