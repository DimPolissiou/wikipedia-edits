(2003), p. 1.</ref> }} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 November 1635 \u2013 3 July 1672) was a psychiatric condition in which there was a persistent false belief and preoccupation with the idea of emitting abnormal body odors which the patient thought were foul and offensive to other individuals. He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; [[cetacea]]ns; [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]]); and [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.<ref name= birkhead241>Birkhead (2018) pp. 241\u2013245.</ref><ref name=jardine307>Jardine (1999) pp. 307\u2013310.</ref><ref name=Kusukawa309>Kusukawa (2016) p. 309.</ref>\n\n===\"Insects\"===\n[[File:Megachile willughbiella male (21626826474).jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby studied this [[Megachile|leaf-cutter bee]], named by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|Kirby]] in 1802 as ''[[Megachile willughbiella]]''.|alt=a bee on a flower]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the term \"insect\" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, ''Historia Insectorum'', included many other [[invertebrate]]s, such as worms, spiders and [[millipede]]s. It excluded [[Mollusca|molluscs]], perhaps because [[Martin Lister]], another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own ''Historia Animalium'' that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.<ref name= birkhead246>Birkhead (2018) pp. 246\u2013251.</ref>\n\nRay died in January 1705, and little happened with the ''Historia Insectorum'' until [[William Derham]] and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only.<ref name= birkhead246/> Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research,<ref name=kusukawa336>Kusukawa (2016) pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions.<ref name=ogilvie352>Ogilvie (2016) p. 352.</ref> The book had four sections, starting with an innovative [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification system]] based on  [[metamorphosis]].<ref name= birkhead246/> The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles.<ref name=ogilvie340>Ogilvie (2016) p. 340.</ref> Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.<ref name= birkhead246/>\n\n===Games and probability===\n[[File:Playingcardsvanda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby is believed to have studied [[probability]] with respect to card games.

Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers,<ref name= birkhead216>Birkhead (2018) pp. 216\u2013217.</ref> and some were based on [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] oil-paintings of birds in [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[aviary]] in [[St James's Park]].<ref name= birkhead227>Birkhead (2018) pp. 227\u2013228.</ref><ref name= jackson>Jackson (2006) pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nThe illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Giovanni Pietro Olina|Pietro Olina]], [[Georg Marcgrave]] and [[Willem Piso]].<ref name= birkhead2016292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) pp. 292\u2013295.</ref> Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication.<ref name=flis/> In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by [[Carolus Clusius]], [[Adriaen Collaert]], [[Gervase Markham]], [[Juan Eusebio Nieremberg]] and [[Ole Worm]].<ref name= birkhead2016292/><ref name=Gurney>Gurney (1921) pp. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558/page/n220 210\u2013211]</ref> Olina's ''Ucelliera'', at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the ''Ornithology'', since the later version contains a description of [[territory (animal)|territorial]] behaviour by the [[common nightingale|nightingale]] absent from the earlier work.<ref name= birkhead2011223>Birkhead (2011) p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:FMIB 46268 Willoughby's Char.jpeg|thumb| Windermere or Willughby's charr, ''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]''|alt=Drawing of a trout-like fish]]\n\nMuch of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest;<ref name =birkhead89>Birkhead (2018) pp. 89\u201393.</ref><ref name=charm>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive.<ref name=charm373>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) p. 373.</ref> The ''Ornithology'' influenced [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|R\u00e9amur]] in organising his great bird collection, and [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson|Brisson]] in the compilation of his own work on the topic.

He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

{"title_page": "Sequential space", "text_new": "In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], a '''sequential space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a very weak [[axiom of countability]]. Sequential spaces are the most general class of spaces for which [[sequence]]s suffice to determine the topology.\n\nEvery sequential space has [[countable tightness]].\n\n== Definitions ==\n\nLet ''X'' be a topological space. \n*A subset ''U'' of ''X'' is '''sequentially open''' if each sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to a point of ''U'' is eventually in ''U'' (i.e. there exists ''N'' such that ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is in ''U'' for all ''n'' &ge; ''N''.)\n*A subset ''F'' of ''X'' is '''sequentially closed''' if, whenever (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence in ''F'' converging to ''x'', then ''x'' must also be in ''F''.\n\nThe [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a sequentially open set is a sequentially closed set, and vice versa. Every open subset of ''X'' is sequentially open and every closed set is sequentially closed. The converses are not generally true. The sequentially open sets form a topology, which contains the original topology of the space and has the same notion of sequential convergence. \n\n{{Math proof|title=Proofs|drop=hidden|proof=\n* Let ''U'' be sequentially open. Let us show that its complement ''F = X'' \\&thinsp;''U'' is sequentially closed, i.e. that a convergent sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n''\u2208\u2115</sub> of elements of ''F'' has its limit in ''F''. \n\n:Suppose for a contradiction that <math>x_n\\, \\underset{n\\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\, x \\in U</math>, then there exists <math>N \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> such that <math>\\left\\lbrace x_k : k \\geq N\\right\\rbrace \\subset U</math>, which contradicts the fact that all ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are supposed to be in ''F''.\n\n* Conversely if ''F'' is sequentially closed, let us show that its complement ''U = X'' \\&thinsp;''F'' is sequentially open.\n\n:Let (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n''\u2208\u2115</sub> be a sequence in ''X'' such that <math>\\lim_{n\\to \\mathbb{N}} x_n = x \\, \\in U</math> and suppose for a contradiction that for any <math>N \\in \\mathbb{N},\\ \\left\\lbrace x_k : k \\geq N\\right\\rbrace \\not\\subseteq U</math>, i.e. for all <math>N \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> there exists <math>k_N \\geq N,\\ x_{k_N} \\in F = X \\setminus U</math>. Define by recursion the subsequence (''x''<sub>''\u03c6(n)''</sub>)<sub>''n''\u2208\u2115</sub> of elements of ''F'':{{pad|2px}} set{{pad|2px}} ''\u03c6''(0)= ''k''<sub>0</sub>{{pad|2px}} and then{{pad|2px}} ''\u03c6''(''n''+1) = ''k''<sub>''\u03c6''(''n'')+1</sub>, i.e.{{pad|5px}} ''x''<sub>''\u03c6''(0)</sub> := ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub>{{pad|5px}} and{{pad|5px}} ''x''<sub>''\u03c6(n+1)''</sub> = ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>''\u03c6''(''n'')+1</sub></sub>. It is convergent as a subsequence of a convergent sequence, and all its elements are in ''F''. Hence the limit has to be in ''F'', which contradicts that ''x'' \u2208 ''U''. The sequence is therefore eventually in ''U''.\n\n* Let us show that the set of sequentially open subsets is a topology, i.e. \u2205 and ''X'' are sequentially open, arbitrary unions of sequentially open subset is sequentially open and finite intersections of sequentially open subsets is sequentially open.\n\n: Any empty sequence satisfies any property and any sequence in ''X'' is eventually in ''X''. Let (''U<sub>i</sub>'')<sub>''i\u2208I''</sub> be a family of sequentially open subsets, let <math>U = \\bigcup_{i\\in I} U_i</math>, and let (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n''\u2208\u2115</sub> be a sequence in ''X'' converging to ''x'' \u2208 ''U''. ''x'' being in the union means there exists <math>i_0 \\in I</math> such that <math>x \\in U_{i_0}</math> and by sequential openness, the sequence is eventually in ''U''<sub>''i''<sub>0</sub></sub>. Finally, if <math>V = \\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i</math> is a finite intersection of sequentially open subsets, then a sequence converging to ''x'' \u2208 ''V'' eventually converges to each of the ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>, i.e. <math>\\ \\forall\\ i \\in \\mathbb{N},\\ 1 \\leq i \\leq n,\\ \\exists\\ N_i \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> such that <math>\\left\\lbrace x_k : k \\geq N_i\\right\\rbrace \\subset U_i </math>. Taking <math>N = \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} N_i</math>, one has <math>\\left\\lbrace x_k : k \\geq N\\right\\rbrace \\subset V</math>.\n\n* The generated sequential topology is finer than the original one, i.e. if ''U'' is open, then it is sequentially open.\n\n: Let  (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n''\u2208\u2115</sub> be a sequence in ''X'' converging to ''x'' \u2208 ''U''. Since ''U'' is open, it is a neighborhood of ''x'' and by definition of convergence, there exists <math>N \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> such that <math>\\left\\lbrace x_k,\\ k \\geq N\\right\\rbrace \\subset U</math>.\n}}\n\nA '''sequential space''' is a space ''X'' satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions:\n\n#Every sequentially open subset of ''X'' is open.\n#Every sequentially closed subset of ''X'' is closed.\n#For any subset ''S''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''X'' that is not closed, i.e. such that <math>\\overline{S}\\setminus S \\neq \\emptyset</math>, there exists a sequence <math>(x_n)_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in S^{\\mathbb{N}}</math> of elements of ''S'' that converges to an element of <math>\\overline{S}\\setminus S</math>.<ref name=\"Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin L.S.\"> Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin L.S.,{{pad|1px}} General Topology I, definition 9 p.12 </ref>\n\nThat is, the original topology can be reconstructed by knowing the convergent sequences.\n\n{{Math proof|title=Proof of the equivalences|drop=hidden|proof=\n* '''(<math>1 \\Leftrightarrow 2 </math>):''' Assume that any sequentially open subsets is open and let ''F'' be sequentially closed. It is proved above that the complement ''U = X'' \\&thinsp;''F'' is sequentially open and thus open so that ''F'' is closed.

P. Franklin (aka [[Stan Franklin]]) in 1965, who was investigating the question of \"what are the classes of topological spaces that can be specified completely by the knowledge of their convergent sequences?\" Franklin arrived at the definition above by noting that every [[first-countable space]] can be specified completely by the knowledge of its convergent sequences, and then he abstracted properties of first countable spaces that allowed this to be true.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery [[first-countable space]] is sequential, hence each [[second-countable space]], [[metric space]], and [[discrete space]] is sequential. Further examples are furnished by applying the categorical properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential. Here are a few:\n\n*''X'' is the quotient of a first countable space.\n*''X'' is the quotient of a metric space.\n*For every topological space ''Y'' and every map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'', we have that ''f'' is [[continuous (topology)|continuous]] if and only if for every sequence of points (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to ''x'', we have (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converging to ''f''(''x'').\n\nThe final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space.\n\n== Categorical properties ==\n\nThe [[full subcategory]] '''Seq''' of all sequential spaces is closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Quotients\n* Continuous closed or open images\n* Sums\n* Inductive limits\n* Open and closed subspaces\n\nThe category '''Seq''' is ''not'' closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Continuous images\n* Subspaces\n* Finite products\n\nSince they are closed under topological sums and quotients, the sequential spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. In fact, they are the coreflective hull of [[metrizable space]]s (i.e., the smallest class of topological spaces closed under sums and quotients and containing the metrizable spaces).\n\nThe subcategory '''Seq''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]] with respect to its own product (not that of '''Top'''). The [[exponential object]]s are equipped with the (convergent sequence)-open topology. P.I. Booth and A. Tillotson have shown that '''Seq''' is the smallest Cartesian closed subcategory of '''Top''' containing the underlying topological spaces of all [[metric space]]s, [[CW-complex]]es, and [[differentiable manifold]]s and that is closed under colimits, quotients, and other \"certain reasonable identities\" that [[Norman Steenrod]] described as \"convenient\".\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Axioms of countability]]\n*[[First-countable space]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin, L.S., ''General Topology I'', Springer-Verlag, New York (1990) {{isbn|3-540-18178-4}}.\n*Booth, P.I. and Tillotson, A., ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779712 Monoidal closed, cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces]'' Pacific J.

Further examples are furnished by applying the categorical properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential.

For this reason, a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood-like]] atmosphere was used for ''Silent Hill''. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer [[Akira Yamaoka]], the developers did not know how to proceed with the ''Silent Hill'' project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of ''Silent Hill'' had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|era of lower-budget 2D titles]].

For this reason, a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood-like]] atmosphere was used for ''Silent Hill''. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer [[Akira Yamaoka]], the developers did not know how to proceed with the ''Silent Hill'' project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of ''Silent Hill'' had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|era of lower-budget 2D titles]].

He has been described as \"one of the most revered guitarists of his generation\" who has \"drawn praise from fellow musicians including [[Marillion]]'s [[Steve Rothery]] and [[Deep Purple]]'s [[Ritchie Blackmore]].\"<ref name=\"M Magazine\">{{cite web | url= https://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/interview-gordon-giltrap/ | title= Interview: Gordon Giltrap | website=M Magazine| date=10 January 2019 |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGiltrap was born on 6 April 1948 in the village of [[Brenchley]] in [[Kent]]. He started to play the guitar at the age of 12 and received no formal tuition, choosing to develop his own style and technique.\n\n==Career==\nGiltrap's career took off in the 1960s while performing in the [[folk music]] scene in London alongside contemporaries such as [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]], and [[Mike Oldfield]]. At 18, Giltrap signed with [[Transatlantic Records]] and released his debut studio albums, ''Gordon Giltrap'' (1968) and ''Portrait'' (1969). Both feature himself on guitar and lead vocals; Giltrap considered his lyrics as \"naive\".<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 31</ref> The track \"Willow Pattern\" from his debut attracted the praise of guitarist [[Ralph McTell]] for the imagery it portrayed.<ref name=\":0\">''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 39</ref> \"Gospel Song\", also from his first, features a more aggressive strumming style,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2917|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk}}</ref> influenced by [[Pete Townshend]], which later became a trademark of his style. In 1969, Giltrap was featured in Transatlantic's guitar showcase album ''The Contemporary Guitar Sampler, Volume 1''.<ref>The Contemporary Guitar Sampler Vol 1, Transatlantic Records \u2013 TRA SAM 14, 1969</ref> He was also featured on the second volume released in 1970,<ref name=\":1\">The Contemporary Guitar Sampler Volume 2, Transatlantic Records \u2013 TRA SAM 15, 1970</ref> and both increased his profile.\n\nShortly after the release of his first album, Giltrap joined the Buskers' Tour of the UK, headlined by [[Don Partridge]]. Giltrap subsequently formed a band with Partridge called Accolade. Together they released a self-titled album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=4229|title=progarchives|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> While Partridge, had found fame with the hit single 'Rosie' in 1968. Partridge later wrote the sleeve notes for ''Portrait''. Giltrap played lead guitar in the band and penned several compositions. Whilst his involvement in the band certainly helped to raise his profile he felt impatient to move on to recording further new albums under his own name.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.37</ref>\n\nIn 1970 Giltrap signed to [[MCA Records|MCA records]] and released his next album ''Testament of Time'' which was again a mixture of songs and instrumental pieces. The latter included a skillfully-played piece entitled 'Catwalk Blues' which was to resurface, reworked, (and, in Giltrap\u2019s opinion, improved).<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018 First edition, Steve Pilkington, p. 39</ref> on two future albums. It was to be one of the pieces he chose to play on his first television appearance on [[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]] the forerunner to BBC's [[The Old Grey Whistle Test]].\n\nAt this stage he was managed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] who, amongst others, also managed [[Wishbone Ash]]. Strings on the album were arranged by [[Del Newman]] who also played keyboards. Newman had already worked with many well-known artists of that era including [[Cat Stevens]]. As he became better known and more greatly respected, Newman later went on to work with many famous artists including [[Elton John]] and [[George Harrison]].<ref>Perilous Journey 2018 First edition\n\nSteve Pilkington Page 38</ref> Thus began a lasting friendship and indeed it was Giltrap who wrote the foreword for Newman's 2010 autobiography ''A Touch From God (It's Only Rock and Roll)''.<ref>''A Touch From God - It's Only Rock and Roll'', {{ISBN|9781906358792}}</ref> With Newman's influence, the album had a much fuller sound than Giltrap\u2019s previous two albums and he regarded it as a significant step forward.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis association with [[Miles Copeland III|Copeland]] ended when he moved to [[Philips Records|Philips records]] releasing the 1973 album entitled ''Giltrap''. This album was interesting in that it featured a much larger band. On some of the songs he experimented with early instruments (played by Douglas Wooton and Rod and Joseph Sleeping) and some of his lyrics reflected clearly reflected an interest in historical events. The drummer on this album was [[Nicko McBrain|\u201dNicko\u201d McBrain]] who a decade later would join [[Iron Maiden]].\n\nThe front cover photographs reflect Giltrap as a proud father blowing bubbles together with his son, Jamie, who had been born two years previously. The opening track 'When I See My Son' further reflected that pride. Sadly never released on CD, this was the last album on which he sang lead vocals. The photo on the rear cover of the album showed Giltrap wearing a tank top in a Cat Stevens-like pose.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2017, Steve Pilkington, p. 46</ref> As he became less convinced by his lyric writing capabilities he began seeking a different path.\n\nWhile popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'', based on the art and poetry of [[William Blake]]. Work on the new album obviously required significant additional time in the recording studio. Once, whilst recording, he missed the birth of his daughter Sadie, who arrived to his great delight on 5th March 1975.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.56</ref>\n\n''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' was produced by Jon Miller who along with guitarist Roger Hand and keyboard player Rod Edwards<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodedwardsmusic.com/page2.php|title=Rod Edwards Music.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  were known as Triumvirate Productions.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 58</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/823876-Triumvirate-Production|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Hand and Edwards, having listened to demos of some of the material for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' decided that it was time for Giltrap to be dragged, initially reluctantly into the realm of rock music.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> With this new sound however, Giltrap found a different audience and gained greater commercial success.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.59</ref>  To this day he remains grateful to these two for their influence in helping with the new direction his music took at that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the [[singer-songwriter]] approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1389762-Gordon-Giltrap-Band|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, which toured extensively in the UK at that time. \n\nOnce the demos for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' were finished Giltrap found himself with a three album record contract with [https://www.discogs.com/label/24104-The-Electric-Record-Company Electric Records].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref>&nbsp; Now more in the public eye, he was delighted when offered a UK tour supporting the English progressive rock band '[[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]'. This tour helped to raise his public profile significantly. Perhaps as a result of this he was invited to appear on BBC's '[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]' hosted by [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]]. Supported by his full band they performed ''Robes and Crowns/Awakening'''and ''Lucifer's Cage''. Footage of the latter performance still survives and can be seen on the program 'Guitar Heroes at the BBC'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lkrr7/episodes/guide|title=Guitar Heroes at the BBC|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA European tour followed at the end of 1976 as a support act to the well-known rock band, '[[Wishbone Ash]]'. They played several dates in [[Germany]] and were also booked to tour [[Switzerland]]. Unfortunately, upon arriving in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] Giltrap was hit by a car and broke his collarbone.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.66</ref> As he was then unable to play guitar the rest of his tour was sadly cancelled.\n\nHis follow-up album ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It peaked in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No. 29.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=227}}</ref> A [[single (music)|single]] taken from the album, \"''Heartsong''\", received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> The track was later used as the [[theme tune]] of the [[BBC TV]] series ''[[Holiday (TV series)|Holiday]]''. Another of Giltrap's tracks, \"The Carnival\", was specially commissioned by ITV for the theme tune to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s holiday programme ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]''.\n\n''Heartsong'' has subsequently become the tune for which Giltrap is best known and features in his live sets to this day. ''Heartsong'' was eventually nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for the best instrumental/ orchestral piece for that year. The recipient was [[Elton John]] for [[Song for Guy]]. Giltrap told the story of the track's creation to [[Teamrock.com|Teamrock]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/gordon-giltrap/heartsong|title=Songfacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\u201cIt began with a song I did in the late '60s called '<nowiki/>''Starting All Over.''<nowiki/>'When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become '''Heartsong''.' I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it. Then we added the rhythm section from [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[John G. Perry]] (bass).\"\n\n\"At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had. The melody really came out when the [[Minimoog|mini moog]] part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure. Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect. That was something they learnt from working with [[George Martin]].\"\n\nWhilst ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' was composed with a bigger band sound in mind and thus it had greater cohesiveness than the previous album. It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was really pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.71</ref> \n\nIn those days albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them. Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Gordon Giltrap album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', was released in 1978. [[Iron Maiden]], whose future drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] played on the 1973 album by Giltrap, used the same title for a later album, and the font in their logo is quite similar to the \"Gordon Giltrap\" logo on the ''Fear of the Dark'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2948|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high. Creativity was in full flow so material for his next release was relatively swiftly assembled. The resultant album was arguably one of his finest. The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but disappointingly failed to achieve the success of ''Heartsong''.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.86</ref> It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on [[Top of the Pops]].\n\nOne track on the album entitled ''Fast Approaching'' was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap's first album. It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]]. He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.89</ref> Giltrap's electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work. \n\nThe drummer on this album was the highly talented [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] who had also played on the previous two Giltrap albums and who has since progressed to become one of the most highly commended and influential British drummers.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref> One of his first jobs as a professional drummer came when he joined Giltrap to record ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' in 1975/6 and he still speaks fondly of that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref>  He has since played session work with many well known acts including '[[The Who]]'. Indeed, [[Pete Townshend]] initially employed Phillips because he loved his work on Giltrap\u2019s albums.<ref>''Who I Am'' - Pete Townshend.  2012 edition Page 318</ref>  Phillips later became the drummer for the American rock band '[[Toto (band)|Toto]]' which he joined in 1992. \n\nBy this stage in Giltrap's career he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable. He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work. Giltrap's next album '[https://www.giltrap.co.uk/cds/f/CDs/512 The Peacock Party'] which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name. This was in part illustrated by [[Alan Aldridge]] who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled '[[The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast|The Butterfly Ball and The Grasshopper's Feast]]' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars. The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Hordern]] and it also featured celebrated musicians including [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] and [[Bruce Lynch]] both of whom had previously worked extensively with [[Cat Stevens]]. Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates's version and it was he who brought his next book '[https://www.stellabooks.com/books/alan-aldridge/the-peacock-party-504317/1309545 The Peacock Party]'\u00a0 to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project. Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.107</ref>\n\nGiltrap\u2019s pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound. The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three. The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.105</ref>  and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces. However, whilst working on\u00a0'The Peacock Party' he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many excellent musicians within his pieces with whom he felt very comfortable working. For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap's several collaborations with violinist [[Ric Sanders|Ric Sanders]] of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[John Etheridge]] of '[[Soft Machine]]' also features.\n\nThis album showcases a wide range of Giltrap's talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, 'Headwind' to the intricacy of second acoustic track 'Magpie Rag'. This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based. As the album progresses each track features different ranges of instruments and highlights different skills. \n\nThe final track, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUX6NBMIBE8 Dodo's Dream]' has become a much admired, iconic feature of his live performances in which he uses a [https://www.guitarworld.com/blogs/loop-introduction-looping looper] and overdubbing to skillfully build up the piece.\n\nWhen he finished recording he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally [https://www.discogs.com/artist/1232997-Eddie-Spence Eddie Spence] on keyboards. This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, passed away having contracted cancer aged just 58.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.111</ref> \n\nThe tour to promote the album was four-piece comprising Giltrap, [[Clive Bunker]] - drums, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/648905-Rod-Edwards Rod Edwards] - keyboards and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/417265-Bimbo-Acock 'Bimbo' Acock] on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards. The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low. However, all good things come to an end and a new home required a fresh start. \n\nBy the end of the 1970s he had been commissioned to write a number of notable pieces, such as the classically inspired ''The Brotherhood'', based on the art of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s, and ''The Eye of the Wind Rhapsody'',<ref name=\"Eye\">[http://www.giltrap.co.uk/index.php?page=cds&display=20&category=03--Dual_Disc_DVD-slash-CD \"Gordon Giltrap and Friends at the Symphony Hall\"], Live Recording (2006), La Cooka Ratcha, Cat. No. LCVP160CD</ref> an orchestral work celebrating the exploration of the New World by British sailing ships. In the 1990s Giltrap played a key role in [[Cliff Richard]]'s ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], playing the musical [[narrator]]. He also composed a number of pieces for the show.\n\nIn late 2009, Giltrap started \"Three Parts Guitar\", a short tour with the classical guitarist Raymond Burley and the jazz guitarist [[John Etheridge]]. In 2011 this was expanded to \"Four Parts Guitar\" with the addition of guitarist, [[Clive Carroll]]. An album of the same name was released the same year.\n\nFor two years, around 1997,{{when|date=January 2011}} Giltrap wrote a regular acoustic column for ''Total Guitar'' magazine. An anthology of 26 of these articles is published in ''Total Giltrap'',<ref>Giltrap, Gordon (2002).

The latter included a skillfully-played piece entitled 'Catwalk Blues' which was to resurface, reworked, (and, in Giltrap\u2019s opinion, improved).<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018 First edition, Steve Pilkington, p. 39</ref> on two future albums. It was to be one of the pieces he chose to play on his first television appearance on [[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]] the forerunner to BBC's [[The Old Grey Whistle Test]].\n\nAt this stage he was managed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] who, amongst others, also managed [[Wishbone Ash]]. Strings on the album were arranged by [[Del Newman]] who also played keyboards. Newman had already worked with many well-known artists of that era including [[Cat Stevens]]. As he became better known and more greatly respected, Newman later went on to work with many famous artists including [[Elton John]] and [[George Harrison]].<ref>Perilous Journey 2018 First edition\n\nSteve Pilkington Page 38</ref> Thus began a lasting friendship and indeed it was Giltrap who wrote the foreword for Newman's 2010 autobiography ''A Touch From God (It's Only Rock and Roll)''.<ref>''A Touch From God - It's Only Rock and Roll'', {{ISBN|9781906358792}}</ref> With Newman's influence, the album had a much fuller sound than Giltrap\u2019s previous two albums and he regarded it as a significant step forward.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis association with [[Miles Copeland III|Copeland]] ended when he moved to [[Philips Records|Philips records]] releasing the 1973 album entitled ''Giltrap''. This album was interesting in that it featured a much larger band. On some of the songs he experimented with early instruments (played by Douglas Wooton and Rod and Joseph Sleeping) and some of his lyrics reflected clearly reflected an interest in historical events. The drummer on this album was [[Nicko McBrain|\u201dNicko\u201d McBrain]] whom a decade later would join [[Iron Maiden]].\n\nThe front cover photographs reflect Giltrap as a proud father blowing bubbles together with his son, Jamie, who had been born two years previously. The opening track 'When I See My Son' further reflected that pride. Sadly never released on CD, this was the last album on which he sang lead vocals. The photo on the rear cover of the album showed Giltrap wearing a tank top in a Cat Stevens-like pose.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2017, Steve Pilkington, p. 46</ref> As he became less convinced by his lyric writing capabilities he began seeking a different path.\n\nWhile popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'', based on the art and poetry of [[William Blake]]. Work on the new album obviously required significant additional time in the recording studio. Once, whilst recording, he missed the birth of his daughter Sadie, who arrived to his great delight on 5th March 1975.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.56</ref>\n\n''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' was produced by Jon Miller who along with guitarist Roger Hand and keyboard player Rod Edwards<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodedwardsmusic.com/page2.php|title=Rod Edwards Music.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  were known as Triumvirate Productions.<ref>''Perilous Journey'', First Edition 2018, Steve Pilkington. p. 58</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/823876-Triumvirate-Production|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Hand and Edwards, having listened to demos of some of the material for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' decided that it was time for Giltrap to be dragged, initially reluctantly into the realm of rock music.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> With this new sound however, Giltrap found a different audience and gained greater commercial success.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.59</ref>  To this day he remains grateful to these two for their influence in helping with the new direction his music took at that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref> The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the [[singer-songwriter]] approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1389762-Gordon-Giltrap-Band|title=Discogs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, which toured extensively in the UK at that time. \n\nOnce the demos for ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' were finished Giltrap found himself with a three album record contract with [https://www.discogs.com/label/24104-The-Electric-Record-Company Electric Records].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.57</ref>&nbsp; Now more in the public eye, he was delighted when offered a UK tour supporting the English progressive rock band '[[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]'. This tour helped to raise his public profile significantly. Perhaps as a result of this he was invited to appear on BBC's '[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]' hosted by [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]]. Supported by his full band they performed ''Robes and Crowns/Awakening'''and ''Lucifer's Cage''. Footage of the latter performance still survives and can be seen on the program 'Guitar Heroes at the BBC'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lkrr7/episodes/guide|title=Guitar Heroes at the BBC|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA European tour followed at the end of 1976 as a support act to the well-known rock band, '[[Wishbone Ash]]'. They played several dates in [[Germany]] and were also booked to tour [[Switzerland]]. Unfortunately, upon arriving in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] Giltrap was hit by a car and broke his collarbone.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.66</ref> As he was then unable to play guitar the rest of his tour was sadly cancelled.\n\nHis follow-up album ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It peaked in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No. 29.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=227}}</ref> A [[single (music)|single]] taken from the album, \"''Heartsong''\", received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" /> The track was later used as the [[theme tune]] of the [[BBC TV]] series ''[[Holiday (TV series)|Holiday]]''. Another of Giltrap's tracks, \"The Carnival\", was specially commissioned by ITV for the theme tune to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s holiday programme ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]''.\n\n''Heartsong'' has subsequently become the tune for which Giltrap is best known and features in his live sets to this day. ''Heartsong'' was eventually nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for the best instrumental/ orchestral piece for that year. The recipient was [[Elton John]] for [[Song for Guy]]. Giltrap told the story of the track's creation to [[Teamrock.com|Teamrock]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/gordon-giltrap/heartsong|title=Songfacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n\u201cIt began with a song I did in the late '60s called '<nowiki/>''Starting All Over.''<nowiki/>'When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become '''Heartsong''.' I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it. Then we added the rhythm section from [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] (drums) and [[John G. Perry]] (bass).\"\n\n\"At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had. The melody really came out when the [[Minimoog|mini moog]] part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure. Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect. That was something they learnt from working with [[George Martin]].\"\n\nWhilst ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, ''[[Perilous Journey]]'' was composed with a bigger band sound in mind and thus it had greater cohesiveness than the previous album. It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was really pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.71</ref> \n\nIn those days albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them. Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Gordon Giltrap album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', was released in 1978. [[Iron Maiden]], whose future drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] played on the 1973 album by Giltrap, used the same title for a later album, and the font in their logo is quite similar to the \"Gordon Giltrap\" logo on the ''Fear of the Dark'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.giltrap.co.uk/news/general/archives/General_News/2948|title=Gordon Giltrap|website=Giltrap.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high. Creativity was in full flow so material for his next release was relatively swiftly assembled. The resultant album was arguably one of his finest. The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but disappointingly failed to achieve the success of ''Heartsong''.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.86</ref> It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on [[Top of the Pops]].\n\nOne track on the album entitled ''Fast Approaching'' was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap's first album. It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]]. He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]].<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.89</ref> Giltrap's electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work. \n\nThe drummer on this album was the highly talented [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] who had also played on the previous two Giltrap albums and who has since progressed to become one of the most highly commended and influential British drummers.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref> One of his first jobs as a professional drummer came when he joined Giltrap to record ''[[Visionary (Gordon Giltrap album)|Visionary]]'' in 1975/6 and he still speaks fondly of that time.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.90</ref>  He has since played session work with many well known acts including '[[The Who]]'. Indeed, [[Pete Townshend]] initially employed Phillips because he loved his work on Giltrap\u2019s albums.<ref>''Who I Am'' - Pete Townshend.  2012 edition Page 318</ref>  Phillips later became the drummer for the American rock band '[[Toto (band)|Toto]]' which he joined in 1992. \n\nBy this stage in Giltrap's career he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable. He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work. Giltrap's next album '[https://www.giltrap.co.uk/cds/f/CDs/512 The Peacock Party'] which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name. This was in part illustrated by [[Alan Aldridge]] who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled '[[The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast|The Butterfly Ball and The Grasshopper's Feast]]' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars. The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of [[Judi Dench]] and [[Michael Hordern]] and it also featured celebrated musicians including [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] and [[Bruce Lynch]] both of whom had previously worked extensively with [[Cat Stevens]]. Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates's version and it was he who brought his next book '[https://www.stellabooks.com/books/alan-aldridge/the-peacock-party-504317/1309545 The Peacock Party]'\u00a0 to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project. Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.107</ref>\n\nGiltrap\u2019s pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound. The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three. The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.105</ref>  and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces. However, whilst working on\u00a0'The Peacock Party' he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many excellent musicians within his pieces with whom he felt very comfortable working. For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap's several collaborations with violinist [[Ric Sanders|Ric Sanders]] of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[John Etheridge]] of '[[Soft Machine]]' also features.\n\nThis album showcases a wide range of Giltrap's talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, 'Headwind' to the intricacy of second acoustic track 'Magpie Rag'. This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based. As the album progresses each track features different ranges of instruments and highlights different skills. \n\nThe final track, '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUX6NBMIBE8 Dodo's Dream]' has become a much admired, iconic feature of his live performances in which he uses a [https://www.guitarworld.com/blogs/loop-introduction-looping looper] and overdubbing to skillfully build up the piece.\n\nWhen he finished recording he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally [https://www.discogs.com/artist/1232997-Eddie-Spence Eddie Spence] on keyboards. This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, passed away having contracted cancer aged just 58.<ref>''Perilous Journey''. 2018, First edition, Steve Pilkington, p.111</ref> \n\nThe tour to promote the album was four-piece comprising Giltrap, [[Clive Bunker]] - drums, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/648905-Rod-Edwards Rod Edwards] - keyboards and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/417265-Bimbo-Acock 'Bimbo' Acock] on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards. The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low. However, all good things come to an end and a new home required a fresh start. \n\nBy the end of the 1970s he had been commissioned to write a number of notable pieces, such as the classically inspired ''The Brotherhood'', based on the art of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s, and ''The Eye of the Wind Rhapsody'',<ref name=\"Eye\">[http://www.giltrap.co.uk/index.php?page=cds&display=20&category=03--Dual_Disc_DVD-slash-CD \"Gordon Giltrap and Friends at the Symphony Hall\"], Live Recording (2006), La Cooka Ratcha, Cat. No. LCVP160CD</ref> an orchestral work celebrating the exploration of the New World by British sailing ships. In the 1990s Giltrap played a key role in [[Cliff Richard]]'s ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], playing the musical [[narrator]]. He also composed a number of pieces for the show.\n\nIn late 2009, Giltrap started \"Three Parts Guitar\", a short tour with the classical guitarist Raymond Burley and the jazz guitarist [[John Etheridge]]. In 2011 this was expanded to \"Four Parts Guitar\" with the addition of guitarist, [[Clive Carroll]]. An album of the same name was released the same year.\n\nFor two years, around 1997,{{when|date=January 2011}} Giltrap wrote a regular acoustic column for ''Total Guitar'' magazine. An anthology of 26 of these articles is published in ''Total Giltrap'',<ref>Giltrap, Gordon (2002). ''Total Giltrap \u2013 Guitar Encounters of the Fingerstyle Kind'', Mel Bay, {{ISBN|0-7866-5676-X}}</ref> a book with an accompanying CD on which he plays the studies and pieces. Giltrap is a regular columnist for ''[[Acoustic (magazine)|Acoustic]]'' magazine.\n\nIn August 2012, he became product ambassador for Guitar Practiced [''sic''] Perfectly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitarpracticedperfectly.com/blog/?p=219|title=\"Gordon Giltrap teams up with Guitar Practised Perfectly\"|website=Guitarpracticedperfectly.com|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe is described as innovative in his biography at [[AllMusic]].<ref name=\"Gordon Giltrap biography\">{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gordon-giltrap-mn0000557460/biography | title= Gordon Giltrap | website=AllMusic | first=Gary | last=Hill | accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nGiltrap was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2019 New Year Honours]], \"for services to music and to charity\".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=62507 |date=29 December 2018 |page=N18 |supp=1}}</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nGiltrap cites [[Hank Marvin]], [[the Beatles]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Donovan]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]], [[Julian Bream]], [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]], [[Edward Elgar]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] as his main musical influences.<ref name=\"M Magazine\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main| Gordon Giltrap discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.giltrap.co.uk/}}\n* {{Allmusic | id= gordon-giltrap-mn0000557460 | label= Gordon Giltrap}}\n* {{discogs artist|536570-Gordon-Giltrap|Gordon Giltrap}}\n\n{{Gordon Giltrap}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Giltrap, Gordon}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:English classical guitarists]]\n[[Category:English folk guitarists]]\n[[Category:English male guitarists]]\n[[Category:English male singers]]\n[[Category:English songwriters]]\n[[Category:Fingerstyle guitarists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Kent]]\n[[Category:People from the Borough of Tunbridge Wells]]\n[[Category:Progressive rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:Transatlantic Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Jefph", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCareer:whom -> who.
