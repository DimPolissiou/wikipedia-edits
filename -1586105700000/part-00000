There are around 1900 Awara speakers that live on the southern slopes of the [[Finisterre Range]], they live along the east and west sides of Leron River basin.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=The phonology and verbal system of Awara : a Papuan language of the Finisterre Range, Papua New Guinea|last1=Quigley|first1=Edward|last2=Qingley|first2=Susan|date=|publisher=Canberra, A.C.T. : Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University|year=2011|isbn=9780858836303|location=|pages=1\u2013263}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\nThe Awara people value group harmony, consensus, and religion. They attend church every Sunday, during these gatherings they also discuss any sorts of problems that people may have until they find a solution. The Church and government roles are separated, but they are also not separated because people who have leadership roles in the government usually have a leadership role in the church. In addition \"all local government functions (meetings, community work projects, etc) are organized at the community church gatherings, regional government matters are also discussed at the regional church meetings.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Alphabet ==\nThe Awara language has 21 letters (Aa, \u00c4\u00e4, Bb, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Hh, Ii, Jj, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo, Pp, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ww, Xx, Yy, Zz), 3 [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (Gw gw, Kw kw, Ng ng) and [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] (Ngw ngw).\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAwara [[consonants]] can be categorized into [[Labial consonant|labial,]] [[Coronal consonant|coronal]], and a dorsal. These are further split into voiced stops, voiceless stops, nasals, and voiced spirants. Many of the consonants in Awara have different sounds (for example voiced lateral /l/ can also be pronounced as [r], and the special character ''b'' represents not only a voiced labial stop [b], but also a voiced fricative [v] or a glide [w]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consonant Phonemes\n!\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Labialised Velar\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n!Voiced stops\n|b\n|d\n|\n|g<sup>w</sup>\n|g\n|\n|-\n!Voiceless stop\n|p\n|t\n|\n|k<sup>w</sup>\n|k\n|\n|-\n!Voiced Fricatives\n|b\n|\n|\n|\n|\u1e21\n|\n|-\n!Voiceless fricatives\n|\n|s \n|\n|\n|\n|h\n|-\n!Nasals\n|m\n|n\n|\n|\u014b<sup>w</sup>\n|\u014b\n|\n|-\n!Voiced laterals\n|\n|l\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Glides\n|\n|\n|y\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are 6 [[vowel]]s in Awara. The vowels /e, i, u/ generally appear before the consonants /m/ and /l/, but they can sometimes appear after them. The vowels are split into three categories: front vowels (I and e), middle/central vowels (A and a), and back vowels (u and o). The front vowels in Awara are generally lax. There are a few allophones for vowels in Awara. [I] is usually pronounced as [t] in addition to [I].<ref name=\":0\" />  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Vowel Phonemes\n!\n!Front\n!Mid\n!Back\n|-\n!High\n|I\n|\n|u\n|-\n!Mid\n|e\n|A\n|o\n|-\n!Low\n|\n|a\n|\n|}\n\n=== Syllables ===\n[[Syllable]]s in Awara will generally follow a CVC pattern, this can be split to patterns like V, CV, or VC. The rule is consonants must always be separated by a vowel, the common vowel order of a word in Awara would be V followed by CV which is then followed by VC. So, a word in Awara will follow a pattern like this \u201cVCVCVC.\u201d Different patterns appear at different places. For example, \u201cV syllables can never occur at the end of the word, VC syllables occur word initially and sometimes medially but never at the end, and CVC and CV can occur anywhere in a word.\u201d  <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Stress ===\nAwara uses a pitch accent system this is common in many Papuan languages. Awara itself has three different patterns of stress, one primary and two secondary or alternate patterns. The primary pattern stresses the first and third syllables, while the main focus of the stress falls on the last syllable that is stressed.<br>\nExample:<br>\n/Ayi/ -> a.yi 'grandmother'. In this word the 'yi' is stressed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Reduplication ===\nIn Awara reduplication is usually applied to bisyllabic words. The word ''matekmatekrn\u2206'' 'little things' is the only exception to this rule, as its base is trisyllabic, expanded by the  derivative suffix''-n\u2206 which shows reduplication.'' There are two types of reduplication in Awara. The first one duplicates an already existing word with its own meaning and lowers the semantic category of the word. An example of this is ''halu'' and ''haluhalu'': ''halu'' means 'beach', and the reduplicated form ''haluhalu'' means 'sand', i.e. what is ''on'' the beach. The second type of reduplication copies bases that by themselves have no meaning. For example ''gak'' by itself has no meaning but ''gakgak'' refers to a tree species.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nAwara pronouns are linked to verbs, for this the verb endings are changed to reflect whether the action is about you someone else or more than one person. An example of this would be changing the verb for sew into he will sew it, the verb for sew is bup in order to change this into will sew we need to add pik after it. This changes the word to bupik which means 'he will sew'.   <br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+p,b verbs\n!\n!Future\n!Immediate\n|-\n|1s\n| -pit\n| -pa\n|-\n|2s\n| -pil\u039bk\n|\n|-\n|3s\n| -pik\n| -p\u039bn\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ p,b verb endings\n!\n!Future\n!Immediate \n|-\n!1s\n|b\n|d\n|-\n!2s\n|b\n|d\n|-\n|}\n\n== Morphology ==\n=== Verbs ===\nAwara [[verb]]s can be split into two subcategories, ones that take inflectional affixes and ones that do not. Most verbs do take inflectional affixes. The only verbs that do not take the inflectional affixes are the existential verbs ''k\u00e4y\u00e4'' 'exist' and ''wen\u00e4'' 'not exist'.\n\nWa sade miting-u k\u00e4y\u00e4<br>\nthis Sunday meeting-TOP exist<br>\n'This Sunday there is a meeting.'\n\nNormally existential verbs stand alone as the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] but ti 'be' can be used with them to support tense or switch-reference.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoyo yiwit-na, nax-u wen\u00e4 ti-wik<br>\nwithoutStay-1P.DSfood=Top not.exist be-3s.FUT<ref name=\":0\" /><br>\n'If we do nothing (lit.

Noun-verb compounds refer to what is used to perform the action or what happens to the object. Verb-verb compounds describe two actions that occur. The latter type commonly includes the verb ''\u00e4'' 'take' followed by a motion verb such as ''apu'' 'come'.\n\n==== Noun-Verb compound ==== \nA=lut-de-ke n\u00e4-ka-ying=unin.<br>\nPRFOC=nail-detach-ss.PF eat-p.DIFF-23P.PRES=INDIV<br>\n'They picked them with the fingernails and eat them (breadfruit).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Verb-Verb compound ====\nYangg\u00e4 kalux=u t-\u00e4japu na-m-\u00d8.<br>\nwater new=TOP S.O-take-come 1S.O-give-2S.IMM<br>\n'Bring some cold (fresh) water and give it to me.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBenefactive compounding uses the verb ''mi'' 'give', which usually follows another verb.

Sometimes more than one classifier is combined with a noun to clarify what it is used for. For example, ''yangg\u00e4'' 'water' can be combined with the classifier for rope-like things, ''t\u00e4knga'', to refer to a drink). A classifier always appears on the right of a noun and on the left of suffixes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Loan Words ==\n[[Loan words]] in Awara are primarily from [[Tok Pisin]], but there are also some that come from [[English language|English]]. Other words, especially names and religious terms, come from Yabium.  There are three categories of loan words: loan words that conform to Awara phonology, loan words that violate Awara phonology, and loan words that add to the Awara phonemic inventory. Loan words that conform remove their voiced stops and changes them to unreleased voiceless stops (e.g. 'chord' from Tok Pisin changes to ''kod'' in Awara but is spelled as ''kot''). Awara pronounces [r] but it does not exist in their alphabet, so the sound is represented by <l> in writing, as in ''lais'' 'rice, which is pronounced as [rais]. The [r] can be understood as an allophone of /l/. Most loan words are words for things that do not exist in the Awara language. Many of these can be identified by the letter combination ''ai'', as in ''pailot'' 'pilot'.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Modal Nouns ==\nAwara has three modal nouns: ''nang\u00e4s\u00e4'' expresses possibility, ''nang\u00e4n'' expresses obligation, and ''nangge'' expresses purpose. \"They can function as either the argument of a clause, as predicates, and as adverbial modifiers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Modal nouns require [[Non-finite clause|nonfinite clauses]] to accompany them and cannot exist without them.\n\n[Akop'''-nangge'''] nat\u00e4-ke=ng\u00e4 ako-pit.<br>\ncome.up-PURPOSE want-SS.PF=after come.up-1s.FUT<br>\n'When I want to come up, I will.'<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Negation ==\nThere are three phrases that are used for negation in Awara. The two most common ones are ''do='' and ''=undo'', which are found before inflecting verbs. ''ma'' is the third negator, which is used with imperatives, third person hortatives, or a complement of the modal noun ''=nang\u00e4n''.\n\n'''..''' epuxu-wa do=n-u-kin.<br>\ncome.out-1s.DS NEG=1s.o-hit-23p.PAST<br>\n'I went out and they didn't hit me.'<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/awara.htm Alphabet and pronunciation]\n\n{{Finisterre\u2013Huon languages}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Finisterre languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of Papua New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Languages of Morobe Province]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox language\n|name          = Awara\n|altname       = \n|states        = [[Papua New Guinea]]\n|region        = [[Morobe Province]]\n|ethnicity     = \n|speakers      = 1,900\n|date          = 2007 census\n|ref           = e16<!--E17 just rounds this off, E18 just repeats it as an SIL figure-->\n|familycolor   = Papuan\n|fam1          = [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans\u2013New Guinea]]\n|fam2          = [[Finisterre\u2013Huon languages|Finisterre\u2013Huon]]\n|fam3          = [[Finisterre languages|Finisterre]]\n|fam4          = [[Wantoat languages|Wantoat]]\n|iso3          = awx\n|glotto=awar1248\n|glottorefname=Awara\n}}\n\n'''Awara''' is one of the [[Finisterre languages]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

The newscast is a tabloid-style format. The program delivers news headlines in the [[Hiligaynon language]] about the current events in [[Bacolod City]] and [[Negros Occidental]], as it was removed from [[Western Visayas]] to form the [[Negros Island Region]] along with [[Negros Oriental]] from [[Central Visayas]] in 2015, but the region was now disestablished and made defunct since 2017.\n \nIt is aired live daily from ABS-CBN Newscenter Bacolod at 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday, with replays at 12:00 AM to 12:30 AM before O-Shopping. It is also shown abroad through [[The Filipino Channel]].\n\n==History==\n===First years as TV Patrol 4 (1988\u20131995)===\nFollowing the smash success of ''TV Patrol Cebu'' in the middle of 1988, ABS-CBN then handpicked the now revived Channel 4 Bacolod to be the next in line for the introduction of regional news. At that time, it was envisioned that the new newscast would follow a one-hour broadcast, but the planned introduction of nationwide satellite broadcasts revised it to a half-hour slot on weekday afternoons.\n\n''TV Patrol 4'' officially premiered on December 12 that same year that aired in the same afternoon the local news gathered on the same day, a feat that no other local TV station did at that time during its premiere telecast. That same year the newscast made history when it gathered more than 70 percent audience rating. The first anchors   were Harold Limbo, Nick Lizares and Angela Hilado, and reporters Agnes Jundos and Leilani Salem under News Chief Maricon Prudencio and Station Manager Luisa Bing Ascalon. The Hiligaynon newscast won the Kapisanan Ng Mga Brodkasters Ng Pilipinas Golden Dove Awards for Best TV Newscast, In 1991. From TV Patrol 4, the afternoon newscast became TV Patrol Western Visayas and later TV Patrol Bacolod before finally becoming TV Patrol Negros.\n\nFrom the start the newscast has always been aired in the Hiligaynon language of Negros Occidental, and until 1995 had adopted a tri-presenter format. By 1989, the introduction of satellite broadcasts would enable the newscast to cover all of Negros Occidental.\n\n===As TV Patrol Western Visayas (1995\u20132001)===\nWhen it started covering the news from all over Region 6 and began to be aired simultaneously in Bacolod and Iloilo (via live simulcast) on June 12, 1995, ''TV Patrol 4'' became a pan-regional newscast and was renamed to ''TV Patrol Western Visayas''  anchored by [[Alvin Elchico]], Agnes Jundos, & the late Doroteo Amisola. Later, Elchico left the newscast to move to Channel 2 Manila and was later replaced by Honey Grace Catalan as anchor.\n\nSalem, who left the newscast that year, and Amisola later became the first anchors of the TV Patrol Morning Edition, a spinoff program which premiered on July 25, 1995. It was later reformatted and became the long running ''The Morning Show'' which recently won the Anak TV Seal for 2012. That same year, Channel 4 Negros debuted another spinoff, the Saturday afternoon ''Maayong Hapon Illongo'' with Jundos as presenter, also targeting viewers in the Panay provinces in addition to Negros Occidental.\n\n===As TV Patrol Bacolod (2001\u2013April 4, 2007)===\nFrom ''TV Patrol Western Visayas'' the local newscast was renamed ''TV Patrol Bacolod'' as the flagship newscast on June 4, 2001 when ABS-CBN Iloilo launched its originating station (TV-10).\n\n===As TV Patrol Negros (April 9, 2007\u2013March 30, 2020)===\nThe news program was reformatted to ''TV Patrol Negros'' on April 9, 2007 to cover the news from the entire province of Negros Occidental.

On December 12, the newscast celebrated its 28th anniversary.\n\nIn October 2018, longtime anchor Ryan Gamboa left the newscast to run for politics (and later won as councilor of Silay), leaving Mijares as the sole anchor, making her the second ever female solo anchor of a Visayas area regional newscast after Jennifer Garcia's stints as the TV Patrol Panay solo presenter for a few years. It marked its 30th anniversary in December of that year.\n\nIn January 2019, Mijares was soon joined by a rotating crew of regional reporters co-hosting with her from the regional studio control room in Bacolod, pending any future decision to name a co-presenter for the newscast.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, TV Patrol Negros updated their OBB and parts of the graphics package (mostly from the 2012 and 2013 era graphics package) matching those currently used by the main national newscast.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n''Pulso Sa Kwatro'' - News talk show in 1990 and hosted by ''TV Patrol 4'' co-anchor Nick Lizares.\n\n''Banat Visayas, Sulong Mindanao'' - Replaced ''Pulso Sa Kwatro'' in 1996 and hosted by Agnes Lira-Jundos.

Evangelista would later be notable for his TV Patrol discussion segment entitled ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nWith the introduction of international broadcasts in 1989 to the Pacific islands of [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], and later with the birth of [[The Filipino Channel]] in 1994, TV Patrol became the first Philippine newscast and program to be broadcast overseas. It still does so today, now in an expanded reach through TFC and the live web streaming on its official webpage.\n\nIn 1992, both [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]] temporarily took over Tiangco's and Evangelista's chairs until TV Patrol underwent changes on its theme and title card the same year. [[Christine Bersola-Babao|Christine Bersola]] joined the newscast a year later to host Star News until 1996.\n\nIn 1995, [[Korina Sanchez]], who is from Hoy Gising replaced Tiangco to TV Patrol's anchor when the latter moved to [[GMA Network]] after being suspended from doing a TV commercial. Sanchez's as anchor then who would also be placed in Tiangco's seat. The former continued anchoring Tiangco's ''Lingkod Bayan'', a public service segment of the newscast. [[Ted Failon]] replaced Evangelista in TV Patrol and continued anchoring Evangelista's ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nIn 1996, the broadcast had begun to cut its airing time to 30 minutes when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast with [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as his substitute anchor. The newscast was reformatted with a brand new logo (constant version changes) and theme music. This style became identical to the American television network news programs [[ABC World News Tonight]], [[CBS Evening News]] and [[NBC Nightly News]]. [[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]] was hired to become the news reader of trivial segments and features. On January 4, 1999, the newscast returned its airtime to one hour. On February 14, 2000, TV Patrol started its simulcast over AM radio stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] (Manila), [[DYAB-AM|DYAB]] (Cebu), and [[DXAB]] (Davao) and began its online presence through the ABS-CBN News website. On February 23, 2001, De Castro left the newscast to [[2001 Philippine general election|run]] for [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]]. Diaz would later become the interim anchor that month in preparation of De Castro's run as independent senator.\n\n===2001\u20132004: Sanchez era===\n{{main|Korina Sanchez}}\n[[File:Korina Sanchez at abs-cbn studio.jpg|thumb|[[Korina Sanchez]] at ABS-CBN studio in 2013]]\nOn March 12, 2001, [[Korina Sanchez]] who returned to the newscast and she anchored it from 1995-1996 replacing Tiangco who transferred to GMA, [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] who became Noli De Castro's substitute anchor from 1996-2001, and [[Aljo Bendijo]], a former anchor of ''[[TV Patrol Southern Mindanao]]'', took over the anchor chair vacated by De Castro.<ref name=\"philstar.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2002/03/03/152469/aljo-bendijo-promdi-big-city|title=Aljo Bendijo: A promdi in the big city|website=philstar.com}}</ref> Since then, the '''TV''' text in different fonts ([[Impact (typeface)|Impact]], [[Arial]]) was still used & '''Patrol''' text font logo change to [[Handel Gothic]], which still use until now.\n\nIn 2002, TV Patrol began to reformat its studio set, by placing its city background large, it also added a Globe. During that time, Sanchez was situated on news studio, while Bendijo anchored outside the studio.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, TV Patrol relaunched its studio set, newsdesk and graphics, along with the theme music & a silhouetted OBB.

The September 24, 2003 edition, which featured Kris' interview, ate up most of the newscast's airtime, making it extend beyond its 6:30\u20138:00pm time slot.

Aside from its reformat, TV Patrol launches its new slogan \"Subok nang Maasahan\" based on ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs 2004 slogan.\n\nIn September 2004, the ratings of TV Patrol started to decline, since it faced with rival [[GMA Network]]'s new early evening newscast [[24 Oras]]. Thus, the ABS-CBN management needed to relaunch TV Patrol before the year ends. [[Korina Sanchez]] left the newscast on November 19, 2004, in line with the network's effort to regain top slot in the ratings and to make way for the relaunch of the newscast as TV Patrol World.<ref name=\"TVPatrolWorld\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132010: TV Patrol World===\nOn November 22, 2004, TV Patrol relaunched as TV Patrol World to give weight to reports from Filipino communities worldwide. [[Julius Babao]] was joined by [[Ted Failon]] and [[Karen Davila]] as its main anchors, while special segments are anchored by [[Ernie Baron]], [[Phoemela Baranda]], and [[Bernadette Sembrano]], Davila's colleague from [[GMA Network]]. The name \"World\" became related to [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s former [[English language]] late-night newscast [[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]] which was later transferred to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] in 1999 and it airs until this day. For the first time, the newscast used a full stand-up delivery. Ernie Baron died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 23, 2006 and months later, he was replaced by [[Kim Atienza]] as the newscast's resident weatherman.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, TV Patrol World aired a special edition as a conclusion to ABS-CBN's all-afternoon live coverage of the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|burial]] of [[Pope John Paul II]] dubbed as \"Paalam Ama Mula Sa Bayang Minahal Mo\" (\"Goodbye Pope, from the Country you Loved\"). Korina Sanchez and [[Dong Puno]] anchored live from the ABS-CBN Newscenter in [[Quezon City]] as Julius Babao and Karen Davila joined Lynda Jumilla live from the [[Vatican City]], and Henry Omaga-Diaz reported from the Papal memorial in Luneta Park, Manila.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, TV Patrol World updated its logo design, soundtrack, opening billboard, and graphics but the news format remained the same.\n\nIn January 2007, TV Patrol World started to celebrate its 20th anniversary by launching ''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs#iPatrol Mo!|Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo!]]'', an expansion of the citizen journalism segment ''Citizen Patrol'' for the upcoming [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 midterm elections]].\n\nOn November 25, 2007, ABS-CBN aired a documentary special for TV Patrol's 20th anniversary entitled ''TV Patrol: 20 Taon ng Pagpapatrol'' (TV Patrol: 20 Years of Patrolling). It was produced by ABS-CBN and [[Jesuit Communications Foundation|Jesuit Communications]].\n\nDays after the documentary was aired, TV Patrol's November 29, 2007 edition morphed into ''[[News Patrol]] Special Edition'' covering the events surrounding the [[Manila Peninsula siege]]. Anchored by Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez as part of the special ABS-CBN coverage of the rebellion during the day, the edition shocked millions as it featured live the last few hours of the rebellion, including the arrest of ABS-CBN newscaster/anchor Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and scores of local and foreign media personalities by the Philippine military for allegedly conspiring with the rebellion perpetrators.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, TV Patrol unveiled its new set, graphics (with the same red, green, and blue hues identified with the ABS-CBN logo), opening billboard, and new segments, but it retained some of its old segments.

TV Patrol also introduced their [https://archive.today/20130116055720/http://tvpatrol.abs-cbnnews.com/ first main website], and also launched its [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages. Ted Failon, Karen Davila, and Julius Babao were retained as the anchors for the weeknight editions as well as Bernadette Sembrano and Alex Santos as anchors for the weekend edition.\n\nTV Patrol covered the [[Manila hostage crisis]] on August 23, 2010 with the longest telecast in its history, lasting for about two and a half hours from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. It was anchored by Ted Failon and Ces Orena-Drilon at the ABS-CBN Newscenter in Quezon City, and Julius Babao at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] where the hostage taking took place. The edition covered the tragic conclusion to the Manila hostage crisis to millions of viewers worldwide. The August 23 edition drew flak from various concerned viewers making ABS-CBN News revise its Code of Ethics. It eventually got a Finalist nod in the 2011 New York Festivals.\n\nOn October 4 of the same year, a new program segment, ''Winner sa Life!'' with Winnie Cordero was launched with reports on lifestyle and tips on proper living.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Return of former anchors===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the return of former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Noli de Castro|\"Kabayan\" Noli de Castro]] and [[Korina Sanchez]] as weeknight anchors of TV Patrol replacing [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]], and they joined [[Ted Failon]] on November 8, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Karen, Julius bid goodbye to TV Patrol viewers | date=November 5, 2010 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127090708/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | archivedate=January 27, 2011 }}</ref> The reformat introduced some minor changes to the logo, graphics, title cards, opening billboard, and enhanced set design that reflects the \"white\" color scheme used throughout the news program.\n\nOn the same day as the relaunch, Gretchen Fullido replaced Phoemela Baranda as the segment host for Star Patrol, while Bernadette Sembrano was retained as segment host and reporter for Lingkod Kapamilya. A week later after the relaunch, Kim Atienza returned as a weather forecaster after a long absence since August due to heart problems, while Marc Logan was later reinstated as humor and features reporter.\n\nAnother new innovation is the ''Pulso ng Bayan'' (''People's Pulse'') segment, aired on selected Fridays beginning on the same month as the relaunch, that aims to reach to the common people about the issues being raised and broadcast on the newscast. Noli De Castro always hosts this weekly segment and goes out into the streets to ask the people about their reactions about the important news of the week.\n\nIn February 2011, TV Patrol launched its weekday text poll, the first in Philippine television news history, where texters can choose to agree or disagree at the current issues being broadcast in the program. The text poll happens from Monday to Thursday, but was soon expanded to Fridays. Before the end of the newscast, the three anchors give their opinions about the result of the text poll, similar to the PULSO segment popularized during the time when the late Frankie Evangelista and Mel Tiangco were still part of the anchor team with Noli De Castro. Later, new patriotic segments like ''Panalo 'To!'' (''It's a Winner!'') and ''Lakas ng Pinoy'' (''Pinoy's Strength'') debuted in April of the same year.\n\n===March 5, 2012: 25th Anniversary special reformat===\nOn March 5, 2012, to celebrate TV Patrol's 25th anniversary, TV Patrol reformatted their graphics and introduced a new logo (still using the \"ribbons\" theme) and new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present).

First aired on weekdays, some editions are now aired as part of the weekend bulletin.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, actress and model [[Yam Concepcion]] filled in for Gretchen Fullido for the segment ''Star Patrol'' marking the first time in the newscast that a celebrity would fill-in for her (unlike Ginger Conejero, Marie Lozano and [[Tina Marasigan]], who have been part of the News and Current Affairs Division). It earned praise from social media that some requested her to come back again on the newscast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/15/15/why-tv-patrol-viewers-praised-yam-concepcion|title=Why 'TV Patrol' viewers praised Yam Concepcion|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Failon, Sembrano, De Castro era===\n{{main|Ted Failon|Bernadette Sembrano}}\nTV Patrol's opening billboard and title card was slightly updated on August 3, 2015 to reflect [[Bernadette Sembrano]]'s promotion to main weeknight anchor.

However, on the November 9 edition, the first one to be heard on DZMM after 6 years, both of them returned to sitting on the newsdesk.\n\nOn May 6, 2015, in an article published by the Philippine Entertainment Portal and other websites, rumors have been circulated that Webb had resigned from the network and will be moving to [[CNN Philippines]]. With this, viewers didn't see her on the newscast and she was temporarily replaced alternately by May 4, Zen Hernandez until those rumors have been answered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pep.ph/news/local/52131/pinky-webb-leaves-abs-cbn-to-join-cnn-philippines|title=Pinky Webb leaves ABS-CBN to join CNN Philippines?|website=PEP.ph}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2016, prior to the revamp of the opening billboards, graphics and set which were launched on July 4, Zen Hernandez was named the permanent replacement of Webb, joining Elchico. After 3 years, they were seen standing to deliver the newscast instead of using the newsdesk.\n\nOn April 1, 2018, the weekend edition is now also shown in High Definition.\n\n==Theme music==\n<!-- Please do not change the dates shown below unless proved by any external sources. Fixed dates below are based on the History section of the article shown above. -->\n''TV Patrol'' originally used [[Vangelis]]'s \"Pulstar\" as its very first theme music, from March 2, 1987 until November 4, 1994.\n\nIn November 7, 1994, \"Pulstar\" was replaced by [[Ryan Cayabyab]]'s \"ABS-CBN News Theme\", which served as the theme of ''TV Patrol'' and the [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News and Public Affairs]] division until 1996. The theme is currently used as a theme music for ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]]'' which was moved to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC) in 1999, with slight and more modern re-composition.\n\nIn 1996, when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast, it adopted [[Frank Gari|Gari Communications]]' \"Allegro\" from [[KPIX-TV]], a [[CBS]]-owned TV station in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Although, the news theme had also been used by [[KBAK-TV]], a former [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and currently a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California until 1997.\n\nOn March 12, 2001, when De Castro left the show for the elections and Korina Sanchez, Henry Omaga Diaz and Aljo Bendijo replaced him as the new anchors, the Filipino composition of ''Allegro'' was done with elements from the orchestra version and combines the elements of the original 1996-2001 version, the 1994-1996 ABS-CBN News Theme, and the ABS-CBN's jingle.\n\nThe theme underwent re-compositions in 2002, which was also used by ''TV Patrol Sabado/Linggo'' from 2004\u201306, 2004, and 2006, which was rearranged and composed by [[Neocolours]]'s Jimmy Antiporda.\n\nThe theme music from June 30, 2010 to present, which incorporates the elements of \"Pulstar\", ''TV Patrol''<nowiki/>'s 2001 theme, and ''TV Patrol World''<nowiki/>'s 2004 and 2006 theme music.\n\n==Anchors==\n[[File:TV Patroljf0191 07.JPG|thumb|Jasmine Romero and TV Patrol crew at Paco-Dilao Church]]\n\n===Weeknight anchors===\n* [[Noli de Castro]] <small>(main anchor, 1987\u20132001, 2010\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Bernadette Sembrano]] <small>(weekend anchor, 2005\u20132011;

All regional editions airs at about 5:00{{nbsp}}PM (right before the network's ''Primetime Bida'' evening block), with selected editions simulcast over [[The Filipino Channel]] for overseas viewers. Several newscasts were also aired nationwide from August 2016 to January 2018 on [[ABS-CBN Regional Channel]] via [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]]. The ABS-CBN News [[YouTube]] page also included archived videos of past editions since recently for those who have not watched the program as well as for overseas viewers.\n\nIn June 2018, the Regional division merged selected newscasts into super regions. The cutbacks initially left the Southern Luzon (Bicol, Southern Tagalog, Palawan), the Visayas (Panay, Negros, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas), Chavacano and Southern Mindanao editions unchanged; standalone newscasts in North Central Luzon, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Caraga and Central Mindanao officially ended their telecasts on June 29, and were merged to their relevant control hubs in Baguio, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos from July 2. The merger was compensated by adding daily ''News Patrol'' bulletins in its respective super regions.\n\nThe Pampanga newscast was also axed after its June 29 edition; however, as [[DWIN-TV|TV-46 Pampanga]] was downgraded into a semi-satellite station for [[DWWX-TV|Channel 2 Manila]], the newscast was then scaled down as a short local ''News Patrol'' bulletin in July 2.<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018</ref> News reports from there were later included, either as part of the North Luzon edition or integrated to the national newscast itself from August of the same year (Pampanga reports for the North Luzon edition were shelved one month later). The same ''News Patrol'' edition was eventually merged with the North Luzon edition itself, effective from May 20, 2019 (11 months after being axed), but was added a Kapampagan opt-out aired exclusively for TV-46 Pampanga.\n\nABS-CBN voiceover [[Peter Musngi]] uses the regional ''TV Patrol'' in Cebuano (''[[TV Patrol North Mindanao]]'' and ''[[TV Patrol Southern Mindanao]]''), Filipino

De Castro's signature line became a [[Magandang Gabi, Bayan|news magazine program]] which hosted by himself on the same name of a signature line. The signature line went popularized until November 19, 2004, the day [[Korina Sanchez]] first left the newscast, and again since November 8, 2010, the day of his reinstatement.\n\nSegment anchors included [[Ernie Baron]], who served as the newscast's chief meteorologist and provided viewers trivia pertaining to science and history, and actress-personality Angelique Lazo (now with [[People's Television Network|PTV]]), who first hosted Star News, an entertainment news segment.<ref name=\"abs-cbnnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/current-affairs-programs/03/02/12/tv-patrol-turns-25|title=TV Patrol turns 25|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/07/12/star-patrollers-join-dumauals-25th-wedding-anniversary|title=Star Patrollers join Dumauals' 25th wedding anniversary|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\nThe style of the newscast, according to De Castro, was eventually \"Tabloid on the Air\".\nMost of its segments were: \"Wanted\" (later became Pulis Report), & Lingkod Bayan: Ang Puso ng TV Patrol.\n\nHowever, Arevalo eventually left the newscast to host the morning show ''[[Magandang Umaga Po]]'' (previously known as ''Good Morning, Philippines'' and ''Magandang Umaga''). [[Frankie Evangelista]] swapped for him on June 1, 1987. Evangelista would later be notable for his TV Patrol discussion segment entitled ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nWith the introduction of international broadcasts in 1989 to the Pacific islands of [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], and later with the birth of [[The Filipino Channel]] in 1994, TV Patrol became the first Philippine newscast and program to be broadcast overseas. It still does so today, now in an expanded reach through TFC and the live web streaming on its official webpage.\n\nIn 1992, both [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]] temporarily took over Tiangco's and Evangelista's chairs until TV Patrol underwent changes on its theme and title card the same year. [[Christine Bersola-Babao|Christine Bersola]] joined the newscast a year later to host Star News until 1996.\n\nIn 1995, [[Korina Sanchez]], who is from Hoy Gising replaced Tiangco to TV Patrol's anchor when the latter moved to [[GMA Network]] after being suspended from doing a TV commercial. Sanchez's as anchor then who would also be placed in Tiangco's seat. The former continued anchoring Tiangco's ''Lingkod Bayan'', a public service segment of the newscast. [[Ted Failon]] replaced Evangelista in TV Patrol and continued anchoring Evangelista's ''PULSO: Pangkalahatang Ugnayan Laan Sa Opinyon'' (PULSE: Overall Correlation Reserved for Opinions).\n\nIn 1996, the broadcast had begun to cut its airing time to 30 minutes when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast with [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as his substitute anchor. The newscast was reformatted with a brand new logo (constant version changes) and theme music. This style became identical to the American television network news programs [[ABC World News Tonight]], [[CBS Evening News]] and [[NBC Nightly News]]. [[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]] was hired to become the news reader of trivial segments and features. On January 4, 1999, the newscast returned its airtime to one hour. On February 14, 2000, TV Patrol started its simulcast over AM radio stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] (Manila), [[DYAB-AM|DYAB]] (Cebu), and [[DXAB]] (Davao) and began its online presence through the ABS-CBN News website. On February 23, 2001, De Castro left the newscast to [[2001 Philippine general election|run]] for [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]]. Diaz would later become the interim anchor that month in preparation of De Castro's run as independent senator.\n\n===2001\u20132004: Sanchez era===\n{{main|Korina Sanchez}}\n[[File:Korina Sanchez at abs-cbn studio.jpg|thumb|[[Korina Sanchez]] at ABS-CBN studio in 2013]]\nOn March 12, 2001, [[Korina Sanchez]] who returned to the newscast and she anchored it from 1995-1996 replacing Tiangco who transferred to GMA, [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] who became Noli De Castro's substitute anchor from 1996-2001, and [[Aljo Bendijo]], a former anchor of ''[[TV Patrol Southern Mindanao]]'', took over the anchor chair vacated by De Castro.<ref name=\"philstar.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2002/03/03/152469/aljo-bendijo-promdi-big-city|title=Aljo Bendijo: A promdi in the big city|website=philstar.com}}</ref> Since then, the '''TV''' text in different fonts ([[Impact (typeface)|Impact]], [[Arial]]) was still used & '''Patrol''' text font logo change to [[Handel Gothic]], which still use until now.\n\nIn 2002, TV Patrol began to reformat its studio set, by placing its city background large, it also added a Globe. During that time, Sanchez was situated on news studio, while Bendijo anchored outside the studio.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, TV Patrol relaunched its studio set, newsdesk and graphics, along with the theme music & a silhouetted OBB.

The September 24, 2003 edition, which featured Kris' interview, ate up most of the newscast's airtime, making it extend beyond its 6:30\u20138:00pm time slot. According to AGB, the edition, the longest in its history back then, garnered a rating of 47.2% in [[Mega Manila]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=GMA-7 not bothered by ABS-CBN ratings surge | date=September 28, 2003 | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer | url=http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/28/ent_2-1.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Julius Babao later joined the news studio, which would expand the set with a video wall. Aside from its reformat, TV Patrol launches its new slogan \"Subok nang Maasahan\" based on ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs 2004 slogan.\n\nIn September 2004, the ratings of TV Patrol started to decline, since it faced with rival [[GMA Network]]'s new early evening newscast [[24 Oras]]. Thus, the ABS-CBN management needed to relaunch TV Patrol before the year ends. [[Korina Sanchez]] left the newscast on November 19, 2004, in line with the network's effort to regain top slot in the ratings and to make way for the relaunch of the newscast as TV Patrol World.<ref name=\"TVPatrolWorld\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132010: TV Patrol World===\nOn November 22, 2004, TV Patrol relaunched as TV Patrol World to give weight to reports from Filipino communities worldwide. [[Julius Babao]] was joined by [[Ted Failon]] and [[Karen Davila]] as its main anchors, while special segments are anchored by [[Ernie Baron]], [[Phoemela Baranda]], and [[Bernadette Sembrano]], Davila's colleague from [[GMA Network]]. The name \"World\" became related to [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s former [[English language]] late-night newscast [[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]] which was later transferred to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] in 1999 and it airs until this day. For the first time, the newscast used a full stand-up delivery. Ernie Baron died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 23, 2006 and months later, he was replaced by [[Kim Atienza]] as the newscast's resident weatherman.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, TV Patrol World aired a special edition as a conclusion to ABS-CBN's all-afternoon live coverage of the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|burial]] of [[Pope John Paul II]] dubbed as \"Paalam Ama Mula Sa Bayang Minahal Mo\" (\"Goodbye Pope, from the Country you Loved\"). Korina Sanchez and [[Dong Puno]] anchored live from the ABS-CBN Newscenter in [[Quezon City]] as Julius Babao and Karen Davila joined Lynda Jumilla live from the [[Vatican City]], and Henry Omaga-Diaz reported from the Papal memorial in Luneta Park, Manila.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, TV Patrol World updated its logo design, soundtrack, opening billboard, and graphics but the news format remained the same.\n\nIn January 2007, TV Patrol World started to celebrate its 20th anniversary by launching ''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs#iPatrol Mo!|Boto Mo I-Patrol Mo!]]'', an expansion of the citizen journalism segment ''Citizen Patrol'' for the upcoming [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 midterm elections]].\n\nOn November 25, 2007, ABS-CBN aired a documentary special for TV Patrol's 20th anniversary entitled ''TV Patrol: 20 Taon ng Pagpapatrol'' (TV Patrol: 20 Years of Patrolling). It was produced by ABS-CBN and [[Jesuit Communications Foundation|Jesuit Communications]].\n\nDays after the documentary was aired, TV Patrol's November 29, 2007 edition morphed into ''[[News Patrol]] Special Edition'' covering the events surrounding the [[Manila Peninsula siege]]. Anchored by Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez as part of the special ABS-CBN coverage of the rebellion during the day, the edition shocked millions as it featured live the last few hours of the rebellion, including the arrest of ABS-CBN newscaster/anchor Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and scores of local and foreign media personalities by the Philippine military for allegedly conspiring with the rebellion perpetrators.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, TV Patrol unveiled its new set, graphics (with the same red, green, and blue hues identified with the ABS-CBN logo), opening billboard, and new segments, but it retained some of its old segments.

Julius Babao anchored the August 5 edition with Ted Failon and Korina Sanchez, with the two anchoring the ABS-CBN special broadcast \"Salamat President Cory: Ang Huling Paalam\" since morning. Karen Davila joined Henry Omaga Diaz and Ces Orena Drilon with other reporters stationed at Manila Memorial Park.

TV Patrol also introduced their [https://archive.today/20130116055720/http://tvpatrol.abs-cbnnews.com/ first main website], and also launched its [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages. Ted Failon, Karen Davila, and Julius Babao were retained as the anchors for the weeknight editions as well as Bernadette Sembrano and Alex Santos as anchors for the weekend edition.\n\nTV Patrol covered the [[Manila hostage crisis]] on August 23, 2010 with the longest telecast in its history, lasting for about two and a half hours from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. It was anchored by Ted Failon and Ces Orena-Drilon at the ABS-CBN Newscenter in Quezon City, and Julius Babao at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] where the hostage taking took place. The edition covered the tragic conclusion to the Manila hostage crisis to millions of viewers worldwide. The August 23 edition drew flak from various concerned viewers making ABS-CBN News revise its Code of Ethics. It eventually got a Finalist nod in the 2011 New York Festivals.\n\nOn October 4 of the same year, a new program segment, ''Winner sa Life!'' with Winnie Cordero was launched with reports on lifestyle and tips on proper living.\n\n===2010\u20132012: Return of former anchors===\nOn November 3, 2010, ABS-CBN announced the return of former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Noli de Castro|\"Kabayan\" Noli de Castro]] and [[Korina Sanchez]] as weeknight anchors of TV Patrol replacing [[Julius Babao]] and [[Karen Davila]], and they joined [[Ted Failon]] on November 8, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Karen, Julius bid goodbye to TV Patrol viewers | date=November 5, 2010 | publisher=ABS-CBN News | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127090708/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/tv-patrol/11/05/10/karen-julius-bid-goodbye-tv-patrol-viewers | archivedate=January 27, 2011 }}</ref> The reformat introduced some minor changes to the logo, graphics, title cards, opening billboard, and enhanced set design that reflects the \"white\" color scheme used throughout the news program.\n\nOn the same day as the relaunch, Gretchen Fullido replaced Phoemela Baranda as the segment host for Star Patrol, while Bernadette Sembrano was retained as segment host and reporter for Lingkod Kapamilya. A week later after the relaunch, Kim Atienza returned as a weather forecaster after a long absence since August due to heart problems, while Marc Logan was later reinstated as humor and features reporter.\n\nAnother new innovation is the ''Pulso ng Bayan'' (''People's Pulse'') segment, aired on selected Fridays beginning on the same month as the relaunch, that aims to reach to the common people about the issues being raised and broadcast on the newscast. Noli De Castro always hosts this weekly segment and goes out into the streets to ask the people about their reactions about the important news of the week.\n\nIn February 2011, TV Patrol launched its weekday text poll, the first in Philippine television news history, where texters can choose to agree or disagree at the current issues being broadcast in the program. The text poll happens from Monday to Thursday, but was soon expanded to Fridays. Before the end of the newscast, the three anchors give their opinions about the result of the text poll, similar to the PULSO segment popularized during the time when the late Frankie Evangelista and Mel Tiangco were still part of the anchor team with Noli De Castro. Later, new patriotic segments like ''Panalo 'To!'' (''It's a Winner!'') and ''Lakas ng Pinoy'' (''Pinoy's Strength'') debuted in April of the same year.\n\n===March 5, 2012: 25th Anniversary special reformat===\nOn March 5, 2012, to celebrate TV Patrol's 25th anniversary, TV Patrol reformatted their graphics and introduced a new logo (still using the \"ribbons\" theme) and new opening titles (featuring the TV Patrol logos of the past and the present). A retrospective segment was also added in to commemorate the best events covered during the first 25 years. April 2, 2012 saw newly improved weather graphics and reporting (ABS-CBN Weather Center - in a nod to earlier reports in the past) debut, including a five-day forecast.\n\nCommemorative activities include 25 marker openings in various parts of the country to honor the many important events marked in the first 25 years, and a fund-raising drive aimed at giving back to those who became part of the news coverages through the years.\n\nA new segment, ''CCTV'' (''Concerned Citizens Taking Videos'') ''Patrol'', was launched on June 25, 2012 aimed at citizen journalism and even utilizing CCTV footage and even cellphone footage from the public to convey the latest local news events.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, TV Patrol's anniversary documentary premiered, it was replayed on August 12 due to public demand.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, the brand new segment ''Kabayan Special Patrol'' anchored by De Castro himself continues the program's mission of bringing the latest issues to television viewers all over the nation and globally.\n\n===2013\u20132015: New reformat===\nOn July 29, 2013, TV Patrol, alongside ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'', reformatted their logo, opening titles, and graphics.

First aired on weekdays, some editions are now aired as part of the weekend bulletin.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, actress and model [[Yam Concepcion]] filled in for Gretchen Fullido for the segment ''Star Patrol'' marking the first time in the newscast that a celebrity would fill-in for her (unlike Ginger Conejero, Marie Lozano and [[Tina Marasigan]], who have been part of the News and Current Affairs Division). It earned praise from social media that some requested her to come back again on the newscast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/15/15/why-tv-patrol-viewers-praised-yam-concepcion|title=Why 'TV Patrol' viewers praised Yam Concepcion|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Failon, Sembrano, De Castro era===\n{{main|Ted Failon|Bernadette Sembrano}}\nTV Patrol's opening billboard and title card was slightly updated on August 3, 2015 to reflect [[Bernadette Sembrano]]'s promotion to main weeknight anchor.

The theme is currently used as a theme music for ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine newscast)|The World Tonight]]'' which was moved to [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC) in 1999, with slight and more modern re-composition.\n\nIn 1996, when [[Noli de Castro]] became the sole anchor of the newscast, it adopted [[Frank Gari|Gari Communications]]' \"Allegro\" from [[KPIX-TV]], a [[CBS]]-owned TV station in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Although, the news theme had also been used by [[KBAK-TV]], a former [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and currently a [[CBS]] affiliate in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California until 1997.\n\nOn March 12, 2001, when De Castro left the show for the elections and Korina Sanchez, Henry Omaga Diaz and Aljo Bendijo replaced him as the new anchors, the Filipino composition of ''Allegro'' was done with elements from the orchestra version and combines the elements of the original 1996-2001 version, the 1994-1996 ABS-CBN News Theme, and the ABS-CBN's jingle.\n\nThe theme underwent re-compositions in 2002, which was also used by ''TV Patrol Sabado/Linggo'' from 2004\u201306, 2004, and 2006, which was rearranged and composed by [[Neocolours]]'s Jimmy Antiporda.\n\nThe theme music from June 30, 2010 to present, which incorporates the elements of \"Pulstar\", ''TV Patrol''<nowiki/>'s 2001 theme, and ''TV Patrol World''<nowiki/>'s 2004 and 2006 theme music.\n\n==Anchors==\n[[File:TV Patroljf0191 07.JPG|thumb|Jasmine Romero and TV Patrol crew at Paco-Dilao Church]]\n\n===Weeknight anchors===\n* [[Noli de Castro]] <small>(main anchor, 1987\u20132001, 2010\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Bernadette Sembrano]] <small>(weekend anchor, 2005\u20132011;

All regional editions airs at about 5:00{{nbsp}}PM (right before the network's ''Primetime Bida'' evening block), with selected editions simulcast over [[The Filipino Channel]] for overseas viewers. Several newscasts were also aired nationwide from August 2016 to January 2018 on [[ABS-CBN Regional Channel]] via [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]]. The ABS-CBN News [[YouTube]] page also included archived videos of past editions since recently for those who have not watched the program as well as for overseas viewers.\n\nIn June 2018, the Regional division merged selected newscasts into super regions. The cutbacks initially left the Southern Luzon (Bicol, Southern Tagalog, Palawan), the Visayas (Panay, Negros, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas), Chavacano and Southern Mindanao editions unchanged; standalone newscasts in North Central Luzon, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Caraga and Central Mindanao officially ended their telecasts on June 29, and were merged to their relevant control hubs in Baguio, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos from July 2. The merger was compensated by adding daily ''News Patrol'' bulletins in its respective super regions.\n\nThe Pampanga newscast was also axed after its June 29 edition; however, as [[DWIN-TV|TV-46 Pampanga]] was downgraded into a semi-satellite station for [[DWWX-TV|Channel 2 Manila]], the newscast was then scaled down as a short local ''News Patrol'' bulletin in July 2.<ref>[https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/abs-cbn-regional-cancels-agri-tayo-dito-magtv-na/ ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na] accessed June 30, 2018</ref> News reports from there were later included, either as part of the North Luzon edition or integrated to the national newscast itself from August of the same year (Pampanga reports for the North Luzon edition were shelved one month later). The same ''News Patrol'' edition was eventually merged with the North Luzon edition itself, effective from May 20, 2019 (11 months after being axed), but was added a Kapampagan opt-out aired exclusively for TV-46 Pampanga.\n\nABS-CBN voiceover [[Peter Musngi]] uses the regional ''TV Patrol'' in Cebuano (''[[TV Patrol North Mindanao]]'' and ''[[TV Patrol Southern Mindanao]]''), Filipino

She was joined by [[Ces Ore\u00f1a-Drilon]] (who was one of the final anchors for ''Insider'' with Atty. Dong Puno) and [[Henry Omaga-Diaz]] as the original news anchors. During the pilot episode, it aired a video of General [[Danilo Lim]] organizing a coup d'\u00e9tat against former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].\n\n[[Maria Ressa]], then-head of [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]], explained ''Bandila'' as \"three colors, three stars, three anchors\"<ref name=ban>{{cite news|title=Kapamilya revamps late-night newscast|date=17 June 2006|publisher=inquirer.net|url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20060617-5297}}</ref> referring that of the [[Philippine flag]] having three colors. On the other hand, [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]], then head of Current Affairs, said that the title also depicts the news as \"banner stories\".<ref name=ban /> They also said that they choose three anchors for the late-night newscast as referring to the three stars in the Philippine flag, and chooses Sanchez, Omaga-Diaz and Ore\u00f1a-Drilon as the news anchors because they are the three of the most seasoned and experienced broadcast journalist in the network.\n\nDuring this period, ''Bandila'' covered the New Year Countdown for 2008 and 2009, after failing to air the 2007 New Year Countdown when New Year's Eve of 2006 fell on Sunday as ''Bandila'' airs on Monday-Friday.\n\n===Diaz-Drilon era (2009\u20132010)===\nOn May 8, 2009, Sanchez took an indefinite leave from ''Bandila'' and her [[DZMM]] radio program ''[[Failon Ngayon (radio program)|Tambalang Failon at Sanchez]]'' in anticipation of her wedding to Senator [[Mar Roxas]] and his presidential bid for the 2010 Philippine elections,<ref>{{cite news|title=Korina says wedding day \u2018sooner than later\u2019|date=9 May 2009|publisher=abs-cbnnews.com|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/05/09/09/korina-says-wedding-day-%E2%80%98sooner-later%E2%80%99|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref> leaving Ore\u00f1a-Drilon and Omaga-Diaz as the remaining news anchors, which would serve as a mini-reunion on television after they did the inaugural newscast of [[TV Patrol|TV Patrol Weekend]] in 2004.\n\nAlthough December 31, 2009 fell on Thursday, ''Bandila'' once again failed to air the 2010 New Year Countdown, as a separate Countdown broadcast anchored by [[Bernadette Sembrano]] and Jorge Cari\u00f1o was aired right after the newscast.\n\n===2010 Revamp (2010)===\nA new and improved ''Bandila'' was introduced in time for President-elect [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]]'s [[Inauguration of Benigno Aquino III|inauguration]], on June 30, 2010.

Their arrival to the late-night newscast was scheduled to November 8, but was postponed when Babao was on a vacation that time. Instead, ''Bandila'' was given a new and enhanced studio set, which was exclusively done for ''TV Patrol''.\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Babao and Davila finally arrived to the newscast, replacing Omaga-Diaz who decided to return on field reporting.<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/current-affairs-programs/bandila/11/19/10/karen-julius-join-ces-bandila</ref> The same night, the program updated its graphics, opening billboard, and title card.

This resulted in updating their title card and a new opening billboard. Another innovation for the newscast is by sending reactions through text messaging. Another addition is the segments ''Trending Balita'' (which focuses on different showbiz personalities) and the popular ''Ikaw Na!'' (where Boy Abunda interviews showbiz personalities.)\n\nOn July 29, 2013, ''Bandila'', alongside ''[[TV Patrol]]'', changed their idents and looks, which was first revealed on their official Facebook account.

Both programs are also broadcast in a newly-renovated set, which includes a large screen display and green chroma set. The revamp coincides the 10th anniversary of ''Bandila''.\n\nOn April 17, 2017, ''Bandila'' returned to DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo while undergoing programming changes. It became a standalone broadcast and premiered at 10:00 PM, while the main edition on ABS-CBN will be retained unlike prior to 2011 when it was simulcasted on a slightly-delayed basis.

The newscast then returned to the newly renovated studio on May 13, 2019 during the election coverage, while retaining the current OBB, logo and graphics since 2016, and its theme song since 2018.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Bandila was temporarily replaced by the replay of ''[[TV Patrol]]'' on its timeslot as provisional programming due to the curfew caused by the quarantine done to reduce the spread of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|pandemic in the Philippines]].

Usually, Sanchez would start the program by saying \"sa mga balitang bumabandila.\" This tagline was used by Drilon upon departure of Sanchez in 2009 and this continued until 2010, after which, Julius Babao would said it at the start of the newscast. In 2011, that tagline would only be said upon the start of headlines. Other segments include \"''Patok!''\" (lit. Popular) that sets aside serious news and discusses other features and news that do not deal with politics and public affairs on a lighter note.\n\n===2010 format===\nThe addition of Julius Babao and Karen Davila to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added a desk which allows better interaction shots and more discussions especially now that the newscast strengthens their [[citizen journalism]] campaign. The major change in the current format is the addition of [[interactivity]], which now lets television viewers send in their reactions to each news through the use of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items. The anchors also survey the people occasionally by asking a question that deals with one of the news stories (e.g. \"What are you going to do if you won the lottery?\").\n\n===2011 format===\nThe addition of Boy Abunda to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard.

Few days after, the opening billboard becomes shortened to exclude Drilon.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' (along with the other news programs of ABS-CBN) has finally switched to high definition ([[1080i]], [[16:9]] [[HDTV]]) format, with a temporary background music replacing the news program's theme song \"''Isang Bandila''\". \n\nOn July 2, 2018, ''Bandila'' launched its new original theme song, entitled simply \"''Bandila''\", performed by [[Ebe Dancel]].\n\nOn April 21, 2019, the program temporarily transferred back to the ABS-CBN Newsroom when Studio 7 is being prepared for the coverage of [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 midterm election]] (titled as ''Halalan 2019''.) The newscast then returned to the newly renovated studio on May 13, 2019 during the election coverage, while retaining the current OBB, logo and graphics since 2016, and its theme song since 2018.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Bandila was temporarily replaced by the replay of ''[[TV Patrol]]'' on its timeslot as provisional programming due to the curfew caused by the quarantine done to reduce the spread of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|pandemic in the Philippines]].

The newscast begins with the segment \"''Sa Mga Balitang Bumabandila''\" (lit. In The Waving News) that discusses the top stories of the day. Usually, Sanchez would start the program by saying \"sa mga balitang bumabandila.\" This tagline was used by Drilon upon departure of Sanchez in 2009 and this continued until 2010, after which, Julius Babao would said it at the start of the newscast. In 2011, that tagline would only be said upon the start of headlines. Other segments include \"''Patok!''\" (lit. Popular) that sets aside serious news and discusses other features and news that do not deal with politics and public affairs on a lighter note.\n\n===2010 format===\nThe addition of Julius Babao and Karen Davila to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added a desk which allows better interaction shots and more discussions especially now that the newscast strengthens their [[citizen journalism]] campaign. The major change in the current format is the addition of [[interactivity]], which now lets television viewers send in their reactions to each news through the use of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items. The anchors also survey the people occasionally by asking a question that deals with one of the news stories (e.g. \"What are you going to do if you won the lottery?\").\n\n===2011 format===\nThe addition of Boy Abunda to the news program has seen some minor changes to the graphics, title cards, and opening billboard. They also added another desk separate from the desk used by the three news anchors. The major change in the current format is the addition of sending their reaction through text messaging also through [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The chosen reactions are later read by the anchors after each news items.\n\n===Current format===\nOn May 12, 2014, the program introduced new segments such as \"''Selfie Balita''\" (wherein viewers could tape and record their own reports), \"''Yes or No''\" (wherein the anchors will interview a guest about current issues and then ask them, together with the viewers, with questions answerable only with Yes or No), and \"''Tatak Noypi''\" (wherein Tony Velasquez reports about the unusual and unique characteristics of the Filipino people.)

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical work is ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''Of Habit''); followed by \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical work is ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''Of Habit''); followed by \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).
