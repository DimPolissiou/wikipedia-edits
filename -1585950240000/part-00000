Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user.\n* Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses. [[Simulated child pornography]] is suggested as an alternative so that real children are not harmed.  \n* There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all.\n\n==Views on increasing criminal sexual intent==\n\n===General===\nOne perspective is that exposure to [[child pornography]] promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses,<ref name=\"Onlinepred\"/> but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms.

Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user.\n* Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses. [[Simulated child pornography]] is suggested as an alternative so that real children are not harmed.  \n* There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all.\n\n==Views on increasing criminal sexual intent==\n\n===General===\nOne perspective is that exposure to [[child pornography]] promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses,<ref name=\"Onlinepred\"/> but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms. The authors also note that, \"among some groups of predisposed individuals, easy access to a wide variety of engrossing and high-quality child pornography could serve as a substitute for involvement with actual victims\".<ref name=\"Onlinepred\"/>\n\nAccording to the National District Attorneys Association of America, \"In light of the documented link between individuals who view child pornography and individuals who actually molest children, each child pornography case should be viewed as a red flag to the possibility of actual child molestation.\"<ref name=NDAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |title=From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children |accessdate=2008-05-03 |work=Child Sexual Exploitation Update - Volume 1, Number 3, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111204617/http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}</ref> John Carr, founding member of the United Kingdom Home Secretary\u2019s Internet Task Force on Child Protection, in a report published by the [[Action for Children|NCH]] stated, \"Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children.\"<ref name=\"Carr 2004\"/>\n\n===Research===\nA 1987 report by the U.S.A.

In his testimony, Brown claimed that the growth of technology and the ability to claim anonymity has \"enabled child pornography to become a worldwide epidemic\" and made it more difficult for law enforcement to identify and prosecute child predators. Brown further reasoned that an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) could retain client records for a limited span of time, ranging from a couple hours, days, or weeks, and that a lack of uniformity across ISPs \"significantly hinders law enforcement's ability to identify predators when they come across child pornography.\" He then provided an actual account of when his county received a cybertip from the NCMEC involving an individual who posted that they were exposing themselves to a toddler. The only information he claimed law enforcement possessed was the [[IP address]] that was accessing a YAHOO [[Chat room]] through an [[nTelos]] wireless connection. During the investigation, law enforcement discovered that the ISP only retained the [[Media access control]] address and IP history for 30 days, a limit that foreclosed their opportunity to access investigative material. \n<ref name=\"Testimony\">{{cite web|title=Testimony before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Hearing on \"H.R. 1981 - Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011\"|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|publisher=Congress|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321155614/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21}}</ref>\n\nNCEMC, which created CyberTipline over a decade ago, reported that, \"To date, more than 51 million child pornography images and videos have been reviewed by the analysts in NCMEC's Child Victim Identification Program\" and it is estimated that  \"[Forty] percent or more of people who possess child pornography also sexually assault children\" and H.R. 1981 \"equips federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with the modern-day tools needed to combat the escalation in child pornography and child exploitation crimes.\" <ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt281/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt281-pt1.pdf</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested by critics including the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], that H.R. 1981 was framed as a child protection measure at least in part to make it more difficult for members of Congress to reject the bill.<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|last=Kaste|first=Martin|title=Child Pornography Bill Makes Privacy Experts Skittish|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/24/139875599/child-pornography-bill-makes-privacy-experts-skittish|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=24 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=abc/>\n\n==Privacy issues==\nVarious groups have expressed concerns over the privacy implications of the data providers would be required to retain under the act,<ref name=msnbc>{{cite news|last=Meredith|first=Leslie|title=Child porn law could affect everyone's privacy|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46563165|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=MSNBC|date=28 February 2012}}</ref> including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and the [[American Library Association]].<ref name=\"open\"/>  Concerns raised include the security of the data from a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]],<ref name=pcw>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=Advocacy Group Takes Aim at Anti-Porn Bill|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/250803/advocacy_group_takes_aim_at_antiporn_bill.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=IDG News|date=27 February 2012}}</ref> the nature of the data collected,<ref name=msnbc/> as well as the potential for misuse by law enforcement, or use in investigations that are not child pornography-related.<ref name=atlantic/><ref name=tnw>{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Adhikari | title = Privacy: Can an Anti-child Porn Bill Go Too Far? | date = September 12, 2001 | url = http://www.technewsworld.com/story/73259.html | work = Technology News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\nEven though only assigned IP addresses and certain subscriber data would be retained, some commenters, including the EFF and some editorialists, have suggested that the data could be used to deduce any given user's personal habits, including a detailed map of where they customarily are at any given point in a day.<ref name=msnbc/><ref name=eff>{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Rainey|title=How Internet Companies Would Be Forced to Spy on You Under H.R. 1981|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/how-internet-companies-would-be-forced-spy-you-under-hr-1981|publisher=EFF|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=2012-02-23}}</ref> The CDT also issued a comprehensive memorandum regarding the Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981, in which it detailed how data retention provisions in H.R. 1981 would raise issues concerning privacy and free speech, among the few other issues that the bill raises.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum on Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981|url=http://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/CDT_Letter_HR1981.pdf |publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology}}</ref>\n\nRepresentative [[Zoe Lofgren]], (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the bill, presented an amendment to rename the bill the \"Keep Every American's Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act.\"<ref name=abc>{{cite news | first = Leslie | last = Harris | title = The 'Just in Case You're a Criminal Someday' Act | date = August 9, 2011 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/minority-report-precrime-real-house-bill-online-life/story?id=14258575 | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}</ref>  Rep.

In his testimony, Brown claimed that the growth of technology and the ability to claim anonymity has \"enabled child pornography to become a worldwide epidemic\" and made it more difficult for law enforcement to identify and prosecute child predators. Brown further reasoned that an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) could retain client records for a limited span of time, ranging from a couple hours, days, or weeks, and that a lack of uniformity across ISPs \"significantly hinders law enforcement's ability to identify predators when they come across child pornography.\" He then provided an actual account of when his county received a cybertip from the NCMEC involving an individual who posted that they were exposing themselves to a toddler. The only information he claimed law enforcement possessed was the [[IP address]] that was accessing a YAHOO [[Chat room]] through an [[nTelos]] wireless connection. During the investigation, law enforcement discovered that the ISP only retained the [[Media access control]] address and IP history for 30 days, a limit that foreclosed their opportunity to access investigative material. \n<ref name=\"Testimony\">{{cite web|title=Testimony before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Hearing on \"H.R. 1981 - Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011\"|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|publisher=Congress|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321155614/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Brown07122011.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21}}</ref>\n\nNCEMC, which created CyberTipline over a decade ago, reported that, \"To date, more than 51 million child pornography images and videos have been reviewed by the analysts in NCMEC's Child Victim Identification Program\" and it is estimated that  \"[Forty] percent or more of people who possess child pornography also sexually assault children\" and H.R. 1981 \"equips federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with the modern-day tools needed to combat the escalation in child pornography and child exploitation crimes.\" <ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt281/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt281-pt1.pdf</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested by critics including the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], that H.R. 1981 was framed as a child protection measure at least in part to make it more difficult for members of Congress to reject the bill.<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|last=Kaste|first=Martin|title=Child Pornography Bill Makes Privacy Experts Skittish|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/24/139875599/child-pornography-bill-makes-privacy-experts-skittish|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=24 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=abc/>\n\n==Privacy issues==\nVarious groups have expressed concerns over the privacy implications of the data providers would be required to retain under the act,<ref name=msnbc>{{cite news|last=Meredith|first=Leslie|title=Child porn law could affect everyone's privacy|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46563165|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=MSNBC|date=28 February 2012}}</ref> including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and the [[American Library Association]].<ref name=\"open\"/>  Concerns raised include the security of the data from a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]],<ref name=pcw>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=Advocacy Group Takes Aim at Anti-Porn Bill|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/250803/advocacy_group_takes_aim_at_antiporn_bill.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=IDG News|date=27 February 2012}}</ref> the nature of the data collected,<ref name=msnbc/> as well as the potential for misuse by law enforcement, or use in investigations that are not child pornography-related.<ref name=atlantic/><ref name=tnw>{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Adhikari | title = Privacy: Can an Anti-child Porn Bill Go Too Far? | date = September 12, 2001 | url = http://www.technewsworld.com/story/73259.html | work = Technology News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\nEven though only assigned IP addresses and certain subscriber data would be retained, some commenters, including the EFF and some editorialists, have suggested that the data could be used to deduce any given user's personal habits, including a detailed map of where they customarily are at any given point in a day.<ref name=msnbc/><ref name=eff>{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Rainey|title=How Internet Companies Would Be Forced to Spy on You Under H.R. 1981|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/how-internet-companies-would-be-forced-spy-you-under-hr-1981|publisher=EFF|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=2012-02-23}}</ref> The CDT also issued a comprehensive memorandum regarding the Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981, in which it detailed how data retention provisions in H.R. 1981 would raise issues concerning privacy and free speech, among the few other issues that the bill raises.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum on Data Retention Mandate in H.R. 1981|url=http://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/CDT_Letter_HR1981.pdf |publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology}}</ref>\n\nRepresentative [[Zoe Lofgren]], (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the bill, presented an amendment to rename the bill the \"Keep Every American's Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act.\"<ref name=abc>{{cite news | first = Leslie | last = Harris | title = The 'Just in Case You're a Criminal Someday' Act | date = August 9, 2011 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/minority-report-precrime-real-house-bill-online-life/story?id=14258575 | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}</ref>  Rep.
