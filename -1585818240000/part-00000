To accommodate holidaymakers and to avoid commuting on the steep, {{convert|19|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road to the next major town, there was a post office, a market, and a hospital. By 1937 the number of holiday homes had reached 139 and it became known as the \"[[Da Lat|Dalat]] of central Vietnam\". Most of the visitors were high-ranking French [[VIP]]s. Not surprisingly the Viet Minh tried hard to spoil the holiday \u2013 the area saw some heavy fighting in the early 1950s. After independence from the French, B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 was soon forgotten and the villas abandoned; today they are in total ruin and only a few stone walls remain. At an elevation of 1250 meters above sea level, the national park is a popular summer retreat for the Vietnamese, who come to feel the relief of the cooler temperatures of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3.\n\nThe area around Bach Ma was first protected as a series of forest reserves in 1937 and was declared a protected area by the government of [[South Vietnam]] in 1962. In 1986 the area was established as a [[national park]].

It is located in an area that is considered a centre of plant diversity in Vietnam. The main vegetation type is moist [[evergreen forest|evergreen]] and [[montane forest]], as well as areas of [[scrubland|scrub]] and grassland where human disturbance has been high.\n\nThe mammals of the park are not well known, though historically it held important species such as the [[Asian elephant]], [[white-cheeked gibbon]] and [[red-shanked douc langur]].

It opened in 1946 at 78 Avenue des Champs\u00c9lys\u00e9e and moved to its current location in 1977. It is known for its exotic shows including dancers, singers, and other performers. Famous names have performed there including: [[Edith Piaf]], [[Siegfried and Roy]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Siegfried and Roy at Lido de Paris|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbDMvLj9csw|website=Youtube|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> [[Sylvie Vartan]], [[Ray Vasquez]], [[Renee Victor]], [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Kessler Twins]], [[Elton John]], [[Laurel & Hardy]], [[Dalida]], [[Shirley MacLaine]],<ref name=Maclaine>{{cite web|title=Shirley Maclaine at the Lido|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330885/|website=IMDB|publisher=Amazon.com inc.|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[Juliet Prowse]] and [[No\u00ebl Coward]].\n\n== History ==\nFounded by Joseph and Louis Cl\u00e9rico, Le Lido opened on June 20, 1946. Le Lido was preceded by an artificial beach in a townhouse basement in the 1920s, running as a nightclub/casino in the late night hours.\n\nIn 1955, after a visit by the entertainment director of the [[Stardust Resort and Casino]], Las Vegas, the Cl\u00e9rico brothers along with Donn Arden brought the Lido to the [[Stardust Resort and Casino|Stardust]] Las Vegas. This started a series of imports of Parisian cabaret shows to Las Vegas: [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] to the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]], Nouvelle Eve to [[El Rancho Vegas|Hotel El Rancho Vegas]] and [[Casino de Paris]] to the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]].<ref name=\"Showgirls Project\">{{cite web|title=Lido at the Stardust|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/showgirls/lido-stardust|website=Digital Collections at UNLV|publisher=UNLV|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905083402/http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/showgirls/lido-stardust|archive-date=2015-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Stardust edition of Le Lido closed in 1992.\n\nLe Lido moved in 1977 to the Normandie on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nIn 2006, [[Sodexo]], the international food service company, purchased Le Lido and has invested 24 million euro into developing its current show.<ref name=sodexo>{{cite web|title=SODEXO INVESTIT 25 MILLIONS DANS LA REFONTE DU LIDO|url=http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|website=Hospitality on think tank|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230044205/http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|archivedate=2014-12-30|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Show ==\nThe Lido was closed from December 2, 2014, to April 2, 2015, while a new version of the show was prepared.<ref name=\"lido mainpage\">{{cite web|title=Lido|url=http://www.lido.fr|website=Le Lido|publisher=Le Lido|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> The new version was developed by [[Franco Dragone]]. Each version of Le Lido is made up of 10\u201320 scenes and runs for about an hour and a half. Two shows are run every day of the week. A pre-show dinner, featuring a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj4FPCJQF9A robotic orchestra], is offered with the first evening show of each day at an additional cost.\n\nIn spring 2015, [[Franco Dragone]] created a new show for Le Lido titled ''Paris Merveilles''.<ref name=\"Lesoir 20141008\">http://www.lesoir.be/674814/article/actualite/fil-info/fil-info-styles/2014-10-08/spectacle-du-lido-mis-en-scene-par-dragone-debutera-au-printemps-20</ref>\n\nEach Le Lido show features singers and dancers, which always include the famous Bluebell Girls.<ref name=\"Guardian_obit\">{{cite web|last1=Gentlemen|first1=Amelia|title=Founder of Bluebell Girls dies at 94|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/15/france.arts|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> A few featured dancers, showgirls and lead singers may be added. The Lido is known for its spectacular costumes featuring thousands of dollars in feathers and rhinestones, rich fabrics, and top quality furs.\n\nThe opening or \"theme\" scene welcomes the audience and sets the tone for the evening. It may also set the colour scheme for the show and will feature special effects and lighting. Music may be original or a medley of current popular songs mixed with music from Broadway or Hollywood films; often the opening number is a potpourri of styles and performers may change costumes several times. Between the production numbers, specialty \"vaudeville/cabaret\" acts are featured, such as jugglers, acrobats or magicians. At least one scene will feature water effects \u2013 another thing the Lido is known for. The stage itself can be raised and lowered, may change back and forth into an ice rink or swimming pool, and can feature elaborate set pieces which come up from below. The closing number often features a number called \"Merci Beaucoup\" (featured in the television show ''Shirley Maclaine at The Lido de Paris'') and usually has some particularly spectacular costumes.\n\nAmong the last of its kind, the Lido has a special place in the history of nightclubs and floorshows and continues a tradition of the \"naughty but nice\" opulent production shows originally started by the Folies Berg\u00e8re.\n\n==Bluebell Girls==\n[[File:MargaretKellyGirls.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kelly with the Bluebell Girls in 1948]]\nFounded by [[Margaret Kelly (dancer)|Margaret Kelly]], also known as Miss Bluebell, the dancers of the Lido are known as the Bluebell Girls. Until her retirement in 1986, each dancer was selected by Kelly. The dancers were afterwards under the direction of Pierre Rambert until his retirement in December 2014.<ref name=\"Guardian_obit\" /> According to ''[[Forbes]]'', they are \"some of the world\u2019s most beautiful and talented burlesque dancers\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rooksanahossenally/2016/09/26/5-reasons-the-champs-elysees-avenue-in-paris-is-still-worth-visiting/#3bd9ab5fa602|title=5 Things to do When Visiting the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris|last=Hossenally|first=Rooksana|date=2016-09-26|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en}}</ref> The cast comes from all over the world, and are noted for their statuesque height, averaging 5' 11\".\n\n==Production history==\nEvery few years, Le Lido develops a new version of its show.

Le Lido was preceded by an artificial beach in a townhouse basement in the 1920s, running as a nightclub/casino in the late night hours.\n\nIn 1955, after a visit by the entertainment director of the [[Stardust Resort and Casino]], Las Vegas, the Cl\u00e9rico brothers along with Donn Arden brought the Lido to the [[Stardust Resort and Casino|Stardust]] Las Vegas. This started a series of imports of Parisian cabaret shows to Las Vegas: [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] to the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]], Nouvelle Eve to [[El Rancho Vegas|Hotel El Rancho Vegas]] and [[Casino de Paris]] to the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]].<ref name=\"Showgirls Project\">{{cite web|title=Lido at the Stardust|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/showgirls/lido-stardust|website=Digital Collections at UNLV|publisher=UNLV|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905083402/http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/showgirls/lido-stardust|archive-date=2015-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Stardust edition of Le Lido closed in 1992.\n\nLe Lido moved in 1977 to the Normandie on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nIn 2006, [[Sodexo]], the international food service company, purchased Le Lido and has invested 24 million euro into developing its current show.<ref name=sodexo>{{cite web|title=SODEXO INVESTIT 25 MILLIONS DANS LA REFONTE DU LIDO|url=http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|website=Hospitality on think tank|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230044205/http://www.hospitality-on.com/actualites/2014/12/01/sodexo-investit-25-millions-dans-la-refonte-du-lido/|archivedate=2014-12-30|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Show ==\nThe Lido was closed from December 2, 2014, to April 2, 2015, while a new version of the show was prepared.<ref name=\"lido mainpage\">{{cite web|title=Lido|url=http://www.lido.fr|website=Le Lido|publisher=Le Lido|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> The new version was developed by [[Franco Dragone]].

The Lido is known for its spectacular costumes featuring thousands of dollars in feathers and rhinestones, rich fabrics, and top quality furs.\n\nThe opening or \"theme\" scene welcomes the audience and sets the tone for the evening. It may also set the colour scheme for the show and will feature special effects and lighting. Music may be original or a medley of current popular songs mixed with music from Broadway or Hollywood films; often the opening number is a potpourri of styles and performers may change costumes several times. Between the production numbers, specialty \"vaudeville/cabaret\" acts are featured, such as jugglers, acrobats or magicians. At least one scene will feature water effects \u2013 another thing the Lido is known for. The stage itself can be raised and lowered, may change back and forth into an ice rink or swimming pool, and can feature elaborate set pieces which come up from below. The closing number often features a number called \"Merci Beaucoup\" (featured in the television show ''Shirley Maclaine at The Lido de Paris'') and usually has some particularly spectacular costumes.\n\nAmong the last of its kind, the Lido has a special place in the history of nightclubs and floorshows and continues a tradition of the \"naughty but nice\" opulent production shows originally started by the Folies Berg\u00e8re.\n\n==Bluebell Girls==\n[[File:MargaretKellyGirls.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kelly with the Bluebell Girls in 1948]]\nFounded by [[Margaret Kelly (dancer)|Margaret Kelly]], also known as Miss Bluebell, the dancers of the Lido are known as the Bluebell Girls.

The royalties typically consist of some percentage of the revenues created by the drug in question. That royalty stream can go to scientists, universities or drug development companies. The business of DRI Capital and other firms like it is based on buying the right to be paid that royalty stream from the original rights holder in exchange for an up-front lump-sum payment. The transaction is beneficial to both sides of the deal. For example, the biochemist who originally developed the drug in question may want to diversify the inherent risk of his investment portfolio. If the rights holder is a university, there may be a need for liquid capital to fund the construction of a library or other building. In turn, the transaction benefits a firm like DRI Capital because its able to provide its investors with a reliable and steady revenue stream.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gentleman Pharmer: His father made a fortune on the Future Shop chain.

The royalties typically consist of some percentage of the revenues created by the drug in question. That royalty stream can go to scientists, universities or drug development companies. The business of DRI Capital and other firms like it is based on buying the right to be paid that royalty stream from the original rights holder in exchange for an up-front lump-sum payment. The transaction is beneficial to both sides of the deal. For example, the biochemist who originally developed the drug in question may want to diversify the inherent risk of his investment portfolio. If the rights holder is a university, there may be a need for liquid capital to fund the construction of a library or other building. In turn, the transaction benefits a firm like DRI Capital because its able to provide its investors with a reliable and steady revenue stream.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gentleman Pharmer: His father made a fortune on the Future Shop chain.

The film is perhaps best remembered for the hit track \"Tu Tu Tu Tu Tara\". The film was a big hit at the time of its release and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Juhi Chawla's performance was critically and commercially acclaimed & she received her third [[Filmfare Best Actress Award]] Nomination for her performance in the film. It is unofficial remake of [[The Man with My Face (film)]] and later in 2017 it is remade in Telugu as [[Goutham Nanda]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nKishen Malhotra is an industrialist who heads the Malhotra empire. His relatives are his mother ([[Sushma Seth]]), his uncle ([[Alok Nath]]) and his cousin Bhanu ([[Mohnish Behl]]). One day, he finds his cousin defrauding the company and banishes him from the house. To expand his business, Kishen decides to investigate prospects in a village. Here, he meets a village belle named Radha ([[Juhi Chawla]]).\n\nBesides his work, Kishen also starts teaching English to Radha and some other people of the village. Kishen and Radha slowly fall in love with each other. Unknown to Kishen, somebody is stalking him and reading his mail. Kishen leaves the village (and Radha) and  promises her that he will come back.\n\nOn reaching home, Kishen is surprised to see a mourning at his home. He is even more confused to see people looking astonishingly at him. But, he gets a shock of his life when he sees the portrait of his mother, signifying that his mother is dead. The real sucker punch comes when he sees his duplicate mourning next to his mother's portrait.\n\nWhen he tells that he is Kishen, his duplicate claims the same. When he prods the duplicate to tell something about real Kishen, the duplicate astonishes him by telling him about his life as well as about Radha. Kishen is unable to think as to how the duplicate could know about Radha, but he knows that his pet dog will identify the real master. When the dog, too, goes to the duplicate, Kishen is thrown out of his own home.\n\nMeanwhile, Kishen learns about sudden death of one of his old servants, and he smells foul play. He somehow succeeds to infiltrate into his own office, which is now run by his duplicate. But, he gets arrested. Another servant tells Kishen about his mother's accident, which probably killed her. Kishen also notices that Bhanu is back at home.\n\nMeanwhile, Radha comes to meet Kishen in the city. But, when she sees \"Kishen\" partying with some girls, she thinks that Kishen has forgotten her. She turns to go back, but the real Kishen has escaped police custody. He stops her and explains the whole story. He, Radha and Goonga ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), a dumb convict who has escaped with Kishen, plan to set things straight.\n\nThe trio hide themselves in a boat which takes them to Goa. Here, Kishen meets a girl who calls him Tony. Slowly, he comes to realize that his duplicate's name is Tony Braganza. Tony works as a saxophonist in a Goan club called Three Aces and has a girlfriend there. Kishen starts gathering all information about Tony.\n\nThe trio return to Mumbai. Radha pretends to be a girl named Rita and gains access to Kishen's home. Kishen has identified key players by now: Bhanu, Tony and Inspector T.T. Dholak ([[Kiran Kumar]]). He creates a rift between the trio. An enraged Tony threatens to expose his partners by what he calls his trump card.\n\nThe angered partners take him to the real head behind the game, who is revealed to be Kishen's uncle. Now, Tony shows his trump card &mdash; he tells them that Kishen's mother is still alive and his men have kept her in captivity. She knows nothing about Tony or the events happening.\n\nMeanwhile, Kishen discovers the depth of the trio's planning. He finds that his dog could not identify him as it was not his dog. Like Kishen, his dog, too, had been replaced. Now, Kishen comes back, impersonating Tony and makes Tony's partners throw Tony out the same way Kishen was thrown.\n\nTony comes to the place where he has hid Kishen's mother and convinces her that he is Kishen. Kishen arrives there, too. Kishen's mother tricks the duo and finds out who is her son. Just then, all the villains show up at Tony's den. Kishen's uncle goes on to explain that he never liked the way his dead brother left the entire estate to Kishen's mother.\n\nHe explains that Bhanu was not the only one looting the money. When Bhanu was thrown out, he went till Goa to find him, where he met Tony. As the whole plot is explained, Kishen surprises by saying that he had anticipated this. The money he used to lure out the villains was fake.\n\nIn another twist, Dholak comes out holding a gun on Radha's head. Even Kishen is surprised when Goonga re-introduces himself as Inspector Bhinde. He explains that he was sent undercover by the commissioner as even he smelled a rat.\n\nIn the melee that ensues, the villains are overpowered and arrested. Tony surprises by acknowledging his true identity and saying that there can be only one Kishen. Kishen and Radha are united.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Radha/Rita\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Kishen Malhotra/ Tony Braganza (double role)\n* [[Sushma Seth]] as Sumitra Malhotra\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Shanti Prasad\n* [[Mohnish Behl]] as Kishen's cousin Bhanu\n* [[Kiran Kumar]] as Inspector T.T.

The film is perhaps best remembered for the hit track \"Tu Tu Tu Tu Tara\". The film was a big hit at the time of its release and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Juhi Chawla's performance was critically and commercially acclaimed & she received her third [[Filmfare Best Actress Award]] Nomination for her performance in the film. It is unofficial remake of [[The Man with My Face (film)]] and later in 2017 it is remade in telugu as [[Goutham Nanda]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nKishen Malhotra is an industrialist who heads the Malhotra empire. His relatives are his mother ([[Sushma Seth]]), his uncle ([[Alok Nath]]) and his cousin Bhanu ([[Mohnish Behl]]). One day, he finds his cousin defrauding the company and banishes him from the house. To expand his business, Kishen decides to investigate prospects in a village. Here, he meets a village belle named Radha ([[Juhi Chawla]]).\n\nBesides his work, Kishen also starts teaching English to Radha and some other people of the village. Kishen and Radha slowly fall in love with each other. Unknown to Kishen, somebody is stalking him and reading his mail. Kishen leaves the village (and Radha) and  promises her that he will come back.\n\nOn reaching home, Kishen is surprised to see a mourning at his home. He is even more confused to see people looking astonishingly at him. But, he gets a shock of his life when he sees the portrait of his mother, signifying that his mother is dead. The real sucker punch comes when he sees his duplicate mourning next to his mother's portrait.\n\nWhen he tells that he is Kishen, his duplicate claims the same. When he prods the duplicate to tell something about real Kishen, the duplicate astonishes him by telling him about his life as well as about Radha. Kishen is unable to think as to how the duplicate could know about Radha, but he knows that his pet dog will identify the real master. When the dog, too, goes to the duplicate, Kishen is thrown out of his own home.\n\nMeanwhile, Kishen learns about sudden death of one of his old servants, and he smells foul play. He somehow succeeds to infiltrate into his own office, which is now run by his duplicate. But, he gets arrested. Another servant tells Kishen about his mother's accident, which probably killed her. Kishen also notices that Bhanu is back at home.\n\nMeanwhile, Radha comes to meet Kishen in the city. But, when she sees \"Kishen\" partying with some girls, she thinks that Kishen has forgotten her. She turns to go back, but the real Kishen has escaped police custody. He stops her and explains the whole story. He, Radha and Goonga ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), a dumb convict who has escaped with Kishen, plan to set things straight.\n\nThe trio hide themselves in a boat which takes them to Goa. Here, Kishen meets a girl who calls him Tony. Slowly, he comes to realize that his duplicate's name is Tony Braganza. Tony works as a saxophonist in a Goan club called Three Aces and has a girlfriend there. Kishen starts gathering all information about Tony.\n\nThe trio return to Mumbai. Radha pretends to be a girl named Rita and gains access to Kishen's home. Kishen has identified key players by now: Bhanu, Tony and Inspector T.T. Dholak ([[Kiran Kumar]]). He creates a rift between the trio. An enraged Tony threatens to expose his partners by what he calls his trump card.\n\nThe angered partners take him to the real head behind the game, who is revealed to be Kishen's uncle. Now, Tony shows his trump card &mdash; he tells them that Kishen's mother is still alive and his men have kept her in captivity. She knows nothing about Tony or the events happening.\n\nMeanwhile, Kishen discovers the depth of the trio's planning. He finds that his dog could not identify him as it was not his dog. Like Kishen, his dog, too, had been replaced. Now, Kishen comes back, impersonating Tony and makes Tony's partners throw Tony out the same way Kishen was thrown.\n\nTony comes to the place where he has hid Kishen's mother and convinces her that he is Kishen. Kishen arrives there, too. Kishen's mother tricks the duo and finds out who is her son. Just then, all the villains show up at Tony's den. Kishen's uncle goes on to explain that he never liked the way his dead brother left the entire estate to Kishen's mother.\n\nHe explains that Bhanu was not the only one looting the money. When Bhanu was thrown out, he went till Goa to find him, where he met Tony. As the whole plot is explained, Kishen surprises by saying that he had anticipated this. The money he used to lure out the villains was fake.\n\nIn another twist, Dholak comes out holding a gun on Radha's head. Even Kishen is surprised when Goonga re-introduces himself as Inspector Bhinde. He explains that he was sent undercover by the commissioner as even he smelled a rat.\n\nIn the melee that ensues, the villains are overpowered and arrested. Tony surprises by acknowledging his true identity and saying that there can be only one Kishen. Kishen and Radha are united.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Radha/Rita\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Kishen Malhotra/ Tony Braganza (double role)\n* [[Sushma Seth]] as Sumitra Malhotra\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Shanti Prasad\n* [[Mohnish Behl]] as Kishen's cousin Bhanu\n* [[Kiran Kumar]] as Inspector T.T.

Rama Naidu]], starring [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Vijayashanti]] and [[Charan Raj]] in lead roles. It was later dubbed and released in Tamil as ''Indhiran Chandhiran'' and in Hindi as ''Mayor Sahab''. It was one of the block buster movies in [[Kamal Haasan]]'s direct Telugu films, added with his other cult classics in Telugu such as [[Swati Mutyam]], [[Sagara Sangamam]], [[Subha Sankalpam]] and [[Maro Charitra]].\n\n== Plot ==\nG. K. Rayudu ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is a corrupt Mayor, and along with his assistant Tripathi ([[Charan Raj]]), takes a bribe, sells a market to a rich businessman, and forces the poor people doing business in the land to move out, threatening physical harm. Although Rayudu is married to Janaki ([[Srividya]]), he has a mistress. Rayudu knows that a journalist Sandhya ([[Vijayashanti]]) is investigating. He and his henchmen go to her place to destroy the evidence. She reveals to Rayudu that his mistress and Tripathi are married and have been cheating him out of his money for a long time. He finds Tripathi's stash of diamonds and takes it. After spending some time with his wife and kids, Rayudu gets a change of heart and decides to expose his and Tripathi's illegal activities. Before he leaves, he hides the diamonds inside one of his children's toys. Tripathi finds out, murders Rayudu in a fit of rage, and places the body in cold storage.\n\nPanicking that soon people will realize that Rayudu is missing, Tripathi notices Rayudu's younger lookalike Chandram ([[Kamal Haasan]]) in a mental institution. Deducting that Chandram is faking his mental breakdown to beat a murder charge and avoid jail, they blackmail Chandram into playing Rayudu until a major deal is completed, and Tripathi gets a lot of money. Chandram is promised freedom if he is successful. Chandram learns Rayudu's speech and mannerisms, and with heavy prosthetics and makeup, he becomes a suitable double for the Mayor.\n\nSandhya is trying to expose Rayudu for his illegal activities, but she hasn't found any real evidence yet. As she comes close to exposing Chandram's identity mistakenly, Tripathi sends goons to kill her. Chandram, having heard this, removes his disguise, sneaks out, and saves Sandhya from the goons. When Sandhya gets suspicious about the resemblance between him and Rayudu, Chandram lies that he is Rayudu's son who doesn't like his father's illegal ways. Tripathi's search for his diamonds using Chandram proves futile.\n\nSandhya decides to charm Chandram to get real evidence of Rayudu's illegal activities, so she flirts with him, and they try to meet many times. This leads to hilarious situations in which Chandram has to sneak out without Tripathi's knowledge. Tripathi tries to kill Sandhya one more time. Chandram saves her again, but his cover is blown. Both are on the run from the corrupt police and Tripathi.\n\nChandram finally reveals the truth about his murder charge to the reporter. He used to be a singer and dancer. A contractor named Vallabha Rao ([[Gollapudi Maruthi Rao]]), who helped him and his female dance partner become famous invites them to a hotel room. While Vallabha Rao sends Chandram on an errand run, he brutally tries to rape the female dancer and murders her. He uses his influence to put the blame on Chandram. Chandram is found guilty, but during the trial, he fakes mental retardation and is put in the mental institution. Sandhya and Chandram then fall for each other. Tired of running, they hatch a plan to stop Tripathi and Vallabha Rao, who also happens to be the assistant's partner.\n\nChandram goes back to the crowded market that he sold in the beginning of the film and proclaims that he will give the land back to the people and expose illegal activities he had committed with Tripathi in a big public gathering soon. Tripathi realizes that if he killed Rayudu, he would become the first suspect. He searches for a way to get the upper hand. He traces down Chandram's mother ([[Dubbing Janaki]]), kidnaps her, and uses this as a leverage to blackmail Chandram into not doing anything silly at the public meeting.\n\nThe day before the meeting, since Rayudu's children wanted to spend time with their father, Chandram impersonates Rayudu and plays with the kids. He accidentally finds the diamonds and leaves clues so that the children could find it in the future.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, a huge crowd is built up to hear the speech and it is attended by prominent ministers. Chandram, impersonating Rayudu, is being held on a close watch by Tripathi. With the help of Sandhya and her father ([[P. L. Narayana]]), he finds the location where his mother is being held captive by the corrupt politician who had sent him to jail. He weasels into the car of a prominent minister who asks the assistant to use a different vehicle. Finally free from the assistant's view, Chandram uses the opportunity to leave and rescue his mother, and the corrupt politician is killed in the process. Chandram comes back to the minister's vehicle just in time as the vehicle reaches the press conference, so Tripathi does not suspect anything.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chandram details all the illegal activities he had committed along with Tripathi and other politicians and businessmen with evidence. Just as he finishes his speech, he is shot by an unknown assailant. Chandram turns to Tripathi and blames him before he collapses and dies. The crowd of people becomes agitated and beats Tripathi. An ambulance comes and picks up Chandram's body.\n\nIn the ambulance, Chandram gets up seemingly unharmed. The ambulance is driven by Sandhya's father, who was the unknown assassin. The faux assassination was a distraction to let everyone think that Chandram/Mayor is dead.  They then reveal the real body of Rayudu inside the ambulance. They drive the ambulance into a power grid after jumping out of the vehicle. The ambulance explodes with Rayudu's body inside. To everyone's concern, Rayudu was killed by Tripathi during the press conference. Chandram then walks away to start a new life with Sandhya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Mayor G. K.
