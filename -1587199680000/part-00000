The goal of the project is to provide users with an alternative to the firmware pre-installed on their equipment by the manufacturer, providing:\n* Additional features, making fuller use of the device's hardware\n* Enhanced security\n* More frequent updates\n* Ultimately, greater control over its configuration and behavior\n\nWith over a decade of (mostly) [[Free software|free]] open-source development invested by hundreds of contributors since its inception, there have often been multiple [[fork (software development)|forks]] actively supported at any given time, the unique goals and implementations of each further empowering users to have options and provide feedback on how the device operates.\n\n==History==\nTomato was originally released by Jonathan Zarate in 2006, using the [[Linux]] kernel and drawing extensively on the code of [[HyperWRT]]. It was targeted at many popular routers of the time, most notably the older [[Linksys WRT54G series]], [[AirStation|Buffalo AirStation]], [[Asus Routers|Asus routers]] and [[Netgear WNR3500L]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato|title=Tomato Firmware {{!}} polarcloud.com|website=www.polarcloud.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> His final release of the original Tomato firmware came in June 2010, by which point its popularity had grown large enough that development and support continued through the user community, resulting in a series of releases (dubbed \"[[Modding|mods]]\") by individual users or teams of them that continues to the present day.\n\nFedor Kozhevnikov created a notable early mod he called ''TomatoUSB'', which ceased development in November 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tomato.groov.pl/?page_id=81|title=Tomato by Shibby \u00bb About Tomato (ang.)|website=tomato.groov.pl|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> It was then forked by other developers<ref>[http://tomatousb.org/mods List of Tomato Mods on the TomatoUSB website]</ref> and remains the nearest common ancestor to all of the forks with any recent activity. Arguably the project's largest recognition to date came when Tomato was chosen by [[Asus]] as the base used to build the firmware currently preinstalled on their entire line of home routers, ASUSWRT.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asus.com/ASUSWRT/|title=Asus ASUSWRT|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/about|title=Asuswrt-Merlin \u00bb About|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nAs is often seen in projects founded on volunteer effort, the Tomato ecosystem slowly became more fragmented over time and thus more vulnerable to attrition. As of 2019 there is only a single extant fork under active development: FreshTomato.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Features==\nSeveral notable features have been part of Tomato long enough to be common to all forks, among them are:\n* The [[graphical user interface]] (accessed via web browser), including:\n** Access to almost the entirety of the features provided by the hardware (manufacturers typically omit many of these from their firmware to prevent misuse and reduce support costs)\n** Extensive use of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] to display only the settings that are germane to the device's current setup, reducing confusion and keeping related options near each other using fewer pages/tabs\n** A [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]-based custom interface theming\n** [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]-based graphical bandwidth monitoring, showing total network inbound/outbound activity and that of each connected device through pie charts and line graphs that update in real-time [[File:Tomato bandbreite real.png|alt=Image of TomatoUSB settings page displaying live line graph of incoming and outgoing router bandwidth|thumb|Tomato live bandwidth monitor]]\n* A personal web server ([[Nginx]]) that uses the device's \"always on, always connected\" design to allow users to host their own websites from home for free\n* Access and bandwidth restriction configurable for each device or the network as a whole, providing control over the speed and amount of traffic available at any time to any device\n* Unrestricted access to the internal system logs and the ability to store them for easier troubleshooting and security audits\n* [[Command-line interface|CLI]] access ([[BusyBox]]) via the web-based interface, as well as via [[Telnet]] or [[Secure Shell|SSH]] (using [[Dropbear (software)|Dropbear]])\n* [[Netfilter]]/[[iptables]] with customizable settings, IPP2P and [[l7-filter]]\n* [[Wake-on-LAN]]\n* Advanced [[Quality of service|QoS]]: 10 unique QoS classes defined, real-time graphs display prioritized traffic with traffic class details\n* Client bandwidth control via QoS classes\n* The [[Dnsmasq]] software built-in, which provides:\n** [[DHCP]] server (with static allocation of IP addresses)\n** Local [[Domain Name System|DNS]] server (usually forwarding requests to the DNS provider of choice)\n* Wireless modes:\n** Access point ([[Wireless access point|AP]])\n** Wireless client station ([[Station (networking)|STA]])\n** Wireless Ethernet (WET) [[Bridging (networking)|bridge]]\n** Wireless distribution system ([[Wireless Distribution System|WDS]] also known as wireless bridging)\n** Simultaneous AP and WDS (also known as wireless repeating)\n* [[Dynamic DNS]] service with ezUpdate and services extended for more providers\n* [[SecureEasySetup|SES]] button control\n* [[JFFS2]]\n* [[Server Message Block|SMB]] client\n* [[Wireless LAN]] Adjustment of radio transmit power, antenna selection, and 14 wireless channels\n* 'Boot wait' protection (increase the time slot for uploading firmware via the boot loader)\n* Advanced [[port forwarding]], redirection, and [[Port triggering|triggering]] with [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]] and [[NAT Port Mapping Protocol|NAT-PMP]]\n* [[Init]], shutdown, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], and [[Wide Area Network|WAN]] Up [[Scripting language|scripts]]\n* [[Uptime]], load average, and free memory status\n* Minimal reboots - Very few configuration changes require a reboot\n* [[Wireless site survey|Wireless survey]] page to view other networks in your neighborhood\n* More comprehensive [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboard]] than stock firmware: displays signal strengths of wireless client devices, reveals UPnP mappings\n* Configuration persistence during a firmware upgrade\n\n===Feature comparison===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The goal of the project is to provide users with an alternative to the firmware pre-installed on their equipment by the manufacturer, providing:\n* Additional features, making fuller use of the device's hardware\n* Enhanced security\n* More frequent updates\n* Ultimately, greater control over its configuration and behavior\n\nWith over a decade of (mostly) [[Free software|free]] open-source development invested by hundreds of contributors since its inception, there have often been multiple [[fork (software development)|forks]] actively supported at any given time, the unique goals and implementations of each further empowering users to have options and provide feedback on how the device operates.\n\n==History==\nTomato was originally released by Jonathan Zarate in 2006, using the [[Linux]] kernel and drawing extensively on the code of [[HyperWRT]]. It was targeted at many popular routers of the time, most notably the older [[Linksys WRT54G series]], [[AirStation|Buffalo AirStation]], [[Asus Routers|Asus routers]] and [[Netgear WNR3500L]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato|title=Tomato Firmware {{!}} polarcloud.com|website=www.polarcloud.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> His final release of the original Tomato firmware came in June 2010, by which point its popularity had grown large enough that development and support continued through the user community, resulting in a series of releases (dubbed \"[[Modding|mods]]\") by individual users or teams of them that continues to the present day.\n\nFedor Kozhevnikov created a notable early mod he called ''TomatoUSB'', which ceased development in November 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tomato.groov.pl/?page_id=81|title=Tomato by Shibby \u00bb About Tomato (ang.)|website=tomato.groov.pl|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> It was then forked by other developers<ref>[http://tomatousb.org/mods List of Tomato Mods on the TomatoUSB website]</ref> and remains the nearest common ancestor to all of the forks with any recent activity. Arguably the project's largest recognition to date came when Tomato was chosen by [[Asus]] as the base used to build the firmware currently preinstalled on their entire line of home routers, ASUSWRT.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asus.com/ASUSWRT/|title=Asus ASUSWRT|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/about|title=Asuswrt-Merlin \u00bb About|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nAs is often seen in projects founded on volunteer effort, the Tomato ecosystem slowly became more fragmented over time and thus more vulnerable to attrition. As of 2019 there is only a single extant fork under active development: FreshTomato.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Features==\nSeveral notable features have been part of Tomato long enough to be common to all forks, among them are:\n* The [[graphical user interface]] (accessed via web browser), including:\n** Access to almost the entirety of the features provided by the hardware (manufacturers typically omit many of these from their firmware to prevent misuse and reduce support costs)\n** Extensive use of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] to display only the settings that are germane to the device's current setup, reducing confusion and keeping related options near each other using fewer pages/tabs\n** A [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]-based custom interface theming\n** [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]-based graphical bandwidth monitoring, showing total network inbound/outbound activity and that of each connected device through pie charts and line graphs that update in real-time [[File:Tomato bandbreite real.png|alt=Image of TomatoUSB settings page displaying live line graph of incoming and outgoing router bandwidth|thumb|Tomato live bandwidth monitor]]\n* A personal web server ([[Nginx]]) that uses the device's \"always on, always connected\" design to allow users to host their own websites from home for free\n* Access and bandwidth restriction configurable for each device or the network as a whole, providing control over the speed and amount of traffic available at any time to any device\n* Unrestricted access to the internal system logs and the ability to store them for easier troubleshooting and security audits\n* [[Command-line interface|CLI]] access ([[BusyBox]]) via the web-based interface, as well as via [[Telnet]] or [[Secure Shell|SSH]] (using [[Dropbear (software)|Dropbear]])\n* [[Netfilter]]/[[iptables]] with customizable settings, IPP2P and [[l7-filter]]\n* [[Wake-on-LAN]]\n* Advanced [[Quality of service|QoS]]: 10 unique QoS classes defined, real-time graphs display prioritized traffic with traffic class details\n* Client bandwidth control via QoS classes\n* The [[Dnsmasq]] software built-in, which provides:\n** [[DHCP]] server (with static allocation of IP addresses)\n** Local [[Domain Name System|DNS]] server (usually forwarding requests to the DNS provider of choice)\n* Wireless modes:\n** Access point ([[Wireless access point|AP]])\n** Wireless client station ([[Station (networking)|STA]])\n** Wireless Ethernet (WET) [[Bridging (networking)|bridge]]\n** Wireless distribution system ([[Wireless Distribution System|WDS]] also known as wireless bridging)\n** Simultaneous AP and WDS (also known as wireless repeating)\n* [[Dynamic DNS]] service with ezUpdate and services extended for more providers\n* [[SecureEasySetup|SES]] button control\n* [[JFFS2]]\n* [[Server Message Block|SMB]] client\n* [[Wireless LAN]] Adjustment of radio transmit power, antenna selection, and 14 wireless channels\n* 'Boot wait' protection (increase the time slot for uploading firmware via the boot loader)\n* Advanced [[port forwarding]], redirection, and [[Port triggering|triggering]] with [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]] and [[NAT Port Mapping Protocol|NAT-PMP]]\n* [[Init]], shutdown, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], and [[Wide Area Network|WAN]] Up [[Scripting language|scripts]]\n* [[Uptime]], load average, and free memory status\n* Minimal reboots - Very few configuration changes require a reboot\n* [[Wireless site survey|Wireless survey]] page to view other networks in your neighborhood\n* More comprehensive [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboard]] than stock firmware: displays signal strengths of wireless client devices, reveals UPnP mappings\n* Configuration persistence during a firmware upgrade\n\n===Feature comparison===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The team plays in the [[National Premier Soccer League|National Premier Soccer League (NPSL)]], a national league at the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]], in the Midwest Region. The team play its home games at the [[Aquinas Institute]]'s Wegmans Stadium.\n\nThe team rebranded as the Rochester Lancers in April 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rochester River Dogz FC Rebrands as Rochester Lancers|url=http://www.npsl.com/news_article/show/779145?referral=rss&referrer_id=2168389|website=National Premier Soccer League|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en-us|date=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== About ==\nThe Rochester River Dogz Football Club were accepted to play in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) in November 2015. The River Dogz won their inaugural game 1-0 against FC Buffalo. The River Dogz finished the regular season with a 3-4-3 record. The River Dogz were owned by Marc Mandell and Nick Mojsovski. In 2017 Doug Miller joined the group and convinced Salvatore \"SoccerSam\" Fantauzzo to be part owner and let the group use the Rochester Lancers name and logo. The Lancers celebrated their 50th year in 2017 with the return of the outdoor Lancers in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) and the new Lady Lancers in the [[United Women's Soccer League]] (UWS). The 2017 both Lancers outdoor teams played at the Charlie Schiano Field at The Aquinas Institute. Due to renovations at Aquinas the teams moved to the Marina Auto Stadium for the 2018 season. The team was formed in the NASL in 1967. The team played from 1967-1980. In 2009 SoccerSam purchased the Lancers name and logo for his soccer collection and to pay tribute to the Legends and pioneers of American soccer. In 2011, SoccerSam introduced the indoor Lancers as part of the MISL which became the MASL. Lancers indoor soccer brought back many familiar Rochester soccer favorites, including Doug Miller who was the team's leading scorer for the first three seasons and then became the head coach in the final year. After the 2015 season the team went into hiatus due to issues with the NYS insurance fund.<ref>{{cite

The Original Lancers were founded in 1967, were brought back in 2011 as an indoor team and then joined the NPSL in 2016. The team plays in the [[National Premier Soccer League|National Premier Soccer League (NPSL)]], a national league at the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]], in the Midwest Region. The team play its home games at the [[Aquinas Institute]]'s Wegmans Stadium.\n\nThe team rebranded as the Rochester Lancers in April 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rochester River Dogz FC Rebrands as Rochester Lancers|url=http://www.npsl.com/news_article/show/779145?referral=rss&referrer_id=2168389|website=National Premier Soccer League|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en-us|date=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== About ==\nThe Rochester River Dogz Football Club were accepted to play in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) in November 2015. The River Dogz won their inaugural game 1-0 against FC Buffalo. The River Dogz finished the regular season with a 3-4-3 record. The River Dogz were owned by Marc Mandell and Nick Mojsovski. In 2017 Doug Miller joined the group and convinced Salvatore \"SoccerSam\" Fantauzzo to be part owner and let the group use the Rochester Lancers name and logo. The Lancers celebrated their 50th year in 2017 with the return of the outdoor Lancers in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) and the new Lady Lancers in the [[United Women's Soccer League]] (UWS). The 2017 both Lancers outdoor teams played at the Charlie Schiano Field at The Aquinas Institute. Due to renovations at Aquinas the teams moved to the Marina Auto Stadium for the 2018 season. The team was formed in the NASL in 1967. The team played from 1967-1980. In 2009 SoccerSam purchased the Lancers name and logo for his soccer collection and to pay tribute to the Legends and pioneers of American soccer. In 2011, SoccerSam introduced the indoor Lancers as part of the MISL which became the MASL. Lancers indoor soccer brought back many familiar Rochester soccer favorites, including Doug Miller who was the teams leading scorer for the first three seasons and then became the head coach in the final year. After the 2015 season the team went into hiatus due to issues with the NYS insurance fund.  <ref>{{cite

It enables subscribers to share the risk of living a long life by combining features of a group [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] with a kind of mortality [[lottery]]. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payout.

Nevertheless, in March 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that tontines were getting fresh consideration as a way for people to get steady retirement income.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/retirement/tontines-retirement-annuity.html?_r=0 |title=When Others Die, Tontine Investors Win |website=nytimes.com |date=2017-03-24 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe investment plan is named after [[Naples|Neapolitan]] banker [[Lorenzo de Tonti]], who is popularly credited with inventing it in [[France]] in 1653.

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

Over the next four decades, the Equitable and its imitators sold approximately 9 million policies \u2013 two-thirds of the nation's outstanding insurance contracts. During the [[Panic of 1873]] many life insurance companies went out of business as deteriorating financial conditions created solvency problems: those that survived had all offered tontines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Tony |date=2009 |page=5 |title=The Performance of Life Insurance Companies: 1860\u20131905 |url=http://www.americasmutualbanks.com/images/0714_YangPaper.pdf }}</ref> However, the contracts included an obligation to maintain monthly payments, and as a result spawned large numbers of policy owners whose life savings were wiped out by a single missed payment.

The plot revolves around a tontine originally taken out for some wealthy English children, and the resulting shenanigans as younger family members of the two final survivors vie to secure the final payout. The book was adapted as a [[The Wrong Box|film]], produced and directed by [[Bryan Forbes]], (1966).\n*''The Secret Tontine'' (1912), is an atmospheric faux-gothic novel by [[Robert Murray Gilchrist]], set in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]] during a snowy winter in the late 19th century. The plot involves the potential beneficiaries of a covert tontine, and their scheme to murder their ignorant rivals. \n*[[Lillian de la Torre]]'s short story \"The Tontine Curse\" (1948) features mysterious deaths related to a tontine in 1779, being investigated by [[Samuel Johnson]].\n*''The Tontine'' (1955), a novel by [[Thomas B. Costain]], illustrated by [[Herbert Ryman]], is set in nineteenth-century England and tells a story centered around the fictional \"Waterloo Tontine\", established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member.\n*In ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957), a [[Miss Marple]] murder mystery by [[Agatha Christie]], the plot revolves around the will of a wealthy industrialist, which establishes a [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] under which his estate is divided in trust among his grandchildren, the final survivor to inherit the whole. The settlement is described, inaccurately, as a tontine. \n*''[[Something Fishy]]'' (1957), a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], features a so-called tontine under which the investors' sons stand to gain from marrying late.\n* In the U.S. television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', Episode 16 of Season Two (1966\u201367) \u2013 \"The Night of the Tottering Tontine\" \u2013 finds James West and Artemus Gordon protecting a man who is a member of a tontine whose members are being murdered one by another.\n*\"Old Soldiers,\" an eighth-season episode of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', focuses on a tontine set up among Colonel Potter and several of his Army buddies from [[World War I]]. While taking shelter in a ch\u00e2teau during an artillery barrage, they had found a cache of brandy and drank all but one bottle, which they set aside for the last survivor.

Grampa eventually kicks Burns out of the tontine for trying to kill him, but before he and Bart can do anything with the art, a descendant of the original owner shows up to claim it.\n*In [[S. L. Viehl]]'s science fiction multi-volume novel ''Stardoc'' (2000), the title character is accused of spreading a plague to several colony worlds, on one of which the colonists had established a tontine. The sole survivor, a little girl, consequently becomes so wealthy that in the second book of the series \u2013 ''Beyond Varallan'' (2000) \u2013 she buys the bank behind the colonies to free the Stardoc from the debt she now owes.\n*The 2001 comedy film ''[[Tomcats (2001 film)|Tomcats]]'' features a variation on a tontine where the last investor to get married gets the full amount of the invested funds.\n* In the ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' episode \"The Double Deuce\" (2011), Archer's [[valet]] Woodhouse is revealed as one of three final survivors of a group of World War I [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadron mates who each put [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 into an interest-bearing account, now worth nearly a million [[United States dollar|dollars]]. The office workers at ISIS HQ, realizing that a new tontine could capitalize on the high mortality rate of field agents, begin persuading people to join.\n* The ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' episode \"Being of Sound Mind\" (Season 8 Episode 16) features a tontine as a motive for murder.\n*The ''[[The Brokenwood Mysteries|Brokenwood Mysteries]]'' episode \"Tontine\" (Season 5 Episode 3) centres on a tontine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Buley|first=R.

The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states.

Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

However, the essence of the titans are inseparably bound to the world of Scarn, since they are the world's creators, and so the gods are obliged to simply incapacitate their parents instead of destroying them. Hacked to pieces and/or chained, the felled titans are a constant incentive for the titan-worshippers to resurrect their masters and for the divine races to continue fighting against the titanic abominations.\n\nA great deal of the system's appeal comes from the detail of cultures, cities, governments and history given by the module books. There are also several continents which have been influenced in a lesser degree by the Titan/God war.\n\n=== Titans ===\nIn the game structure, Titans have neither [[Alignment (role-playing games)|Alignment]], nor [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)#Domains|Domains]]. Titans as described through the game are akin to raw natural and universal power. Therefore, giving alignment or domains assignments to these beings would be just like attempting to give them to a bolt of [[lightning]], or [[gravity]].\n\n* Denev, the [[Earth Mother]]\n* Chern, The [[Scourge]]\n* Gaurak, the [[Gluttony|Glutton]]\n* Golthagga, the Shaper\n* Golthain, the Faceless\n* Gormoth, the Writhing Lord\n* Gulaben, Lady of the [[Winds]]\n* Hrinruuk, the [[Hunter]]\n* Kadum, the [[Earthquake|Mountainshaker]]\n* Lethene, Dame of [[Storms]]\n* Mesos, Sire of [[Magic in fiction|Sorcery]]\n* Mormo, Mother of [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpents]]\n* Thulkas, Father of [[Fire]]\n\n=== Gods ===\nWhile the Titans are kin to raw and universal power, the children of the Titans are not. Being a generation away from spontaneous birth is enough to limit the child to godhood in this game setting. \n\nEach God in the system therefore follows the [[d20 System]] rules for gods and NPCs, having both alignment and domains. This is also true of the Titan Denev who supported the gods in their war. \n\nAnother difference in the Scarred Lands system, from other [[d20 System]], is the interaction, and 'awareness' of the Gods by the populations of the sentient beings. Like the land itself, the gods and titans are both major influences of the game. Blacksmiths for example invoke the name of Corean while they work. This in itself may not be different, for game purposes each round that the worshipper invokes his name a +1 may be added to die rolls for: Craft or Profession if the act involves blacksmithing, forging, or the creation of weapons. Other benefits are also described in the ''Scarred Lands Campaign Setting: Ghelspad'' book, and in ''The Divine and the Defeated'' published by [[White Wolf Publishing]].\n* Corean, the Avenger\u2014LG: Fire, Good, Law, Protection, War\n* Madriel, the Redeemer\u2014NG: Air, Good, Healing, Plant, Sun\n* Tanil, the Huntress\u2014CG: Animal, Chaos, Luck, Plant, Travel, Trickery\n* Hedrada, the Lawgiver\u2014LN: Judgment, Knowledge, Law, Protection\n* Enkili, the Trickster\u2014CN: Air, Chaos, Luck, Travel, Trickery\n* Chardun, the Slaver\u2014LE: Domination, Evil, Law, Strength, War\n* Belsameth, the Slayer\u2014NE: Death, Evil, Magic, Trickery\n* Vangal, the Reaver\u2014CE: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, Strength, War\n* Denev, the Earth Mother\u2014N: Air, Animals, Earth, Fire, Plants, Water (Denev Is actually a Titan, but fought alongside the gods in the Titanswar, and can be worshipped as a goddess)\n\n=== The Land ===\nWhile many [[role-playing game system]]s work with weather types and terrain difficulties, the Scarred Lands system brings in the aspect of land as an NPC (Non-Player Character).

However, the essence of the titans are inseparably bound to the world of Scarn, since they are the world's creators, and so the gods are obliged to simply incapacitate their parents instead of destroying them. Hacked to pieces and/or chained, the felled titans are a constant incentive for the titan-worshippers to resurrect their masters and for the divine races to continue fighting against the titanic abominations.\n\nA great deal of the system's appeal comes from the detail of cultures, cities, governments and history given by the module books. There are also several continents which have been influenced in a lesser degree by the Titan/God war.\n\n=== Titans ===\nIn the game structure, Titans have neither [[Alignment (role-playing games)|Alignment]], nor [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)#Domains|Domains]]. Titans as described through the game are kin to [[Elemental|raw natural and universal power]]. Therefore giving alignment or domains assignments to these beings would be just like attempting to give them to a bolt of [[lightning]], or [[gravity]]. \n* Denev, the [[Earth Mother]]\n* Chern, The [[Scourge]]\n* Gaurak, the [[Gluttony|Glutton]]\n* Golthagga, the Shaper\n* Golthain, the Faceless\n* Gormoth, the Writhing Lord\n* Gulaben, Lady of the [[Winds]]\n* Hrinruuk, the [[Hunter]]\n* Kadum, the [[Earthquake|Mountainshaker]]\n* Lethene, Dame of [[Storms]]\n* Mesos, Sire of [[Magic in fiction|Sorcery]]\n* Mormo, Mother of [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpents]]\n* Thulkas, Father of [[Fire]]\n\n=== Gods ===\nWhile the Titans are kin to raw and universal power, the children of the Titans are not. Being a generation away from spontaneous birth is enough to limit the child to godhood in this game setting. \n\nEach God in the system therefore follows the [[d20 System]] rules for gods and NPCs, having both alignment and domains. This is also true of the Titan Denev who supported the gods in their war. \n\nAnother difference in the Scarred Lands system, from other [[d20 System]], is the interaction, and 'awareness' of the Gods by the populations of the sentient beings. Like the land itself, the gods and titans are both major influences of the game. Blacksmiths for example invoke the name of Corean while they work. This in itself may not be different, for game purposes each round that the worshipper invokes his name a +1 may be added to die rolls for: Craft or Profession if the act involves blacksmithing, forging, or the creation of weapons. Other benefits are also described in the ''Scarred Lands Campaign Setting: Ghelspad'' book, and in ''The Divine and the Defeated'' published by [[White Wolf Publishing]].\n* Corean, the Avenger\u2014LG: Fire, Good, Law, Protection, War\n* Madriel, the Redeemer\u2014NG: Air, Good, Healing, Plant, Sun\n* Tanil, the Huntress\u2014CG: Animal, Chaos, Luck, Plant, Travel, Trickery\n* Hedrada, the Lawgiver\u2014LN: Judgment, Knowledge, Law, Protection\n* Enkili, the Trickster\u2014CN: Air, Chaos, Luck, Travel, Trickery\n* Chardun, the Slaver\u2014LE: Domination, Evil, Law, Strength, War\n* Belsameth, the Slayer\u2014NE: Death, Evil, Magic, Trickery\n* Vangal, the Reaver\u2014CE: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, Strength, War\n* Denev, the Earth Mother\u2014N: Air, Animals, Earth, Fire, Plants, Water (Denev Is actually a Titan, but fought alongside the gods in the Titanswar, and can be worshipped as a goddess)\n\n=== The Land ===\nWhile many [[role-playing game system]]s work with weather types and terrain difficulties, the Scarred Lands system brings in the aspect of land as an NPC (Non-Player Character). There are two continents published in a book apiece, Ghelspad and Termana; and three more collected in the last book, Asherak, the Dragon Isles, and Fenrilik.\n\nGhelspad is temperate. Termana is tropical. Asherak is desert. Fenrilik is arctic.\n\n== Novels ==\n\n''The Dead God Trilogy'' by [[Richard Lee Byers]] comprises the titles ''Forsaken'', ''Forsworn,'' and ''Forbidden.'' It recounts the story of an elf (Vladawen Titanslayer) and his companions as they try to deliver their people from a devastating curse by resurrecting the high elven god killed during the Divine War by the titan Chern the Scourge.\n\n== Scarred Lands revival ==\n\nOn October 11, 2013 Nocturnal Media and Onyx Path Publishing purchased the rights to the Scarred Lands fantasy setting.
