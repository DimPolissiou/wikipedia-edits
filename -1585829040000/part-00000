(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925), as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[film|motion picture]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925), as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

W.: \"The Control and Use of Libration-Point Satellites\", Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 1968</ref> Farquhar advocated using spacecraft in a halo orbit on the [[far side of the Moon]] (Earth\u2013Moon {{L2|nolink=yes}}) as a communications relay station for an [[Apollo program|Apollo]] mission to the far side of the Moon. A spacecraft in such a halo orbit would be in continuous view of both the Earth and the far side of the Moon. In the end, no relay satellite was launched for Apollo, since all landings were on the near side of the Moon.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680015886_1968015886.pdf | title=Lunar Far-Side Communication Satellites | last1=Schmid | first1=P.

It traveled to the Sun\u2013Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} point and remained there for several years. The next mission to use a halo orbit was [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO), a joint [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[NASA]] mission to study the Sun, which arrived at Sun\u2013Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} in 1996. It used an orbit similar to ISEE-3.<ref>Dunham, D.W. and Farquhar, R. W.: \"Libration-Point Missions 1978-2000,\" Libration Point Orbits and Applications, Parador d'Aiguablava, Girona, Spain, June 2002</ref> Although several other missions since then have traveled to Lagrange points, they typically have used the related non-periodic variations called [[Lissajous orbit]]s rather than an actual halo orbit. An example is [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]], launched in 2001, which also pioneered the use of [[dynamical systems theory]] to find [[low-energy transfer]]s to and from its orbit.\n\nIn May 2018, Farquhar's original idea was finally realized when China placed the first communications relay satellite into a halo orbit around the Earth-Moon {{L2|nolink=yes}} point.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Xu |first1=Luyuan |title=How China's lunar relay satellite arrived in its final orbit |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2018/20180615-queqiao-orbit-explainer.html |work=The Planetary Society |date=2018-06-15 |language=en |quote=This is the first-ever lunar relay satellite at this location.}}</ref> On 3 January 2019, the [[Chang'e 4]] spacecraft landed in the [[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (lunar crater)|Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater]] on the far side of the Moon, using the Queqiao relay satellite to communicate with the Earth.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Andrew |title=China to launch Chang'e-4 lunar far side landing mission on December 7 |url=https://gbtimes.com/china-to-launch-change-4-lunar-far-side-landing-mission-on-december-7 |work=GBTIMES |date=2018-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/change-4-makes-historic-first-landing-on-the-far-side-of-the-moon/|title=Chang\u2019e-4 returns first images from lunar farside following historic landing|date=2019-01-03|website=SpaceNews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Interplanetary Transport Network]]\n* [[Lissajous orbit]], another Lagrangian-point orbit which generalizes halo orbits.\n* [[:Category:Spacecraft using halo orbits]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet88/vande88.htm SOHO - The Trip to the L1 Halo Orbit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144221/http://www.stk.com/downloads/corporate/partners/edu/SFMpaper.pdf Low Energy Interplanetary Transfers Using Halo Orbit Hopping Method with STK/Astrogator]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170318200526/http://sci2.esa.int/interactive/media/flashes/5_5_1.htm Gaia's Lissajous Type Orbit]&nbsp;\u2014 a Lissajous-type orbit, ''i.e.'', a near-circular ellipse or \"halo\"\n\n{{orbits|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Halo Orbit}}\n\n[[Category:Three-body orbits]]\n\n[[Category:Trojans (astronomy)]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Lagrange points2.svg|thumb|right|350px|Halo orbits orbit the {{L1}}, {{L2}}, or {{L3}} [[Lagrangian point]]s (orbits not shown in diagram).]]\n{{Astrodynamics}}\nA '''halo orbit''' is a periodic, three-dimensional [[orbit]] near one of the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> or L<sub>3</sub> Lagrange point]]s in the [[three-body problem]] of [[orbital mechanics]].

Because halo orbits tend to be unstable, [[Orbital station-keeping|stationkeeping]] is required to keep a satellite on the orbit.\n\nMost satellites in halo orbit serve scientific purposes, for example as [[space telescope]]s.\n\n== Definition and history ==\n{{multiple image | align =right| direction = vertical| width = \n| header = Animation of SOHO{{'s}} trajectory \n| image1 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view\n| image2 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Equatorial view.gif \n| caption2 = Equatorial view\n| footer ={{legend2| RoyalBlue| Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Magenta| SOHO}}\n}}\n[[Robert W.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.  I cannot believe that they knew about those elements and studiously avoided them.  I can only presume that they were not there for everyone from the beginning, that is, from solemn formal and final institution by Jesus himself.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, \"The Historical Jesus\" HarperCollins 1992 p. 364</ref></blockquote>\nPaul's first letter to the Corinthians, in the context of correcting the habits of the Corinthians serves to reestablish \"the Pre-Pauline tradition, ritual of bread/body + meal + ritual of cup/blood.\" <ref>Crossan, John Dominic \"The Birth of Christianity, Harper/Collins, 2002, p. 436</ref>  Hellenized Jew Paul references a Greek weekly Lord's Supper, which is not an annual Jewish Passover meal, and does not have the participants giving thanks (\"Eucharistia\"), rather the purpose is to proclaim Jesus' death until he comes again, in the manner of Hellenic societies formed \"to hold meals in remembrance of those who had died and to drink a cup in honor of some god.\"<ref>Funk, ibid. at 139\u2013140</ref> Some authors would consider Paul to be the \"Founder\" of the Eucharist in a pagan context appealing to the Jewish prohibition against drinking blood, the pervasive history of Greek memorial dining societies, and Paul's own hellenistic background.\"<ref>Funk, Robert, and the Jesus Seminar, \"The Acts of Jesus\" Harper Collins, 1998, p. 139</ref> Paul, however, explicitly stated that he was rehearsing a Christian tradition, something that he himself had \"received\" and had already \"handed on\" to the Corinthians.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaFu25KmgiIC&pg=PA425&dq=paul+eucharist+corinthians&hl=en&ei=I58eTtnEH4exhQeYk_WnAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=paul%20eucharist%20corinthians&f=false Raymond F.

Crossan maintains that table fellowship was central to Jesus' ministry in that was infamous for violating codes of honor to eat freely with outsiders, termed \"sinners and tax collectors\" in the Gospels.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev. Dr. Frank Peake, Manual: The Evolution of the Eucharist]</ref> Nothing is said about them in the Bible but scholars have been able to discover some things about them from other sources. The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation. The historical fact is that the Last Supper was not a Passover celebration and, consequently, that its liturgy was not that of the Jewish Passover.\"<ref>The Celebration of the Eucharist: The Origin of the Rite and the Development of Its Interpretation [Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999] pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nJoachim Jeremias, having rejected the previous two possible backgrounds for the Last Supper argues forcibly that it was a ''Passover Seder'' while recognising that there are difficulties.  His case may be summed as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Was the Last Supper a Passover Seder?  according to Joachim Jeremias<ref>[http://www.abcog.org/green1.htm Eucharistic Sacrifice in the New Testament]</ref>\n|-\n! Ten factors substantiating Passover\n! Nine factors in objection to Passover actions that would be in violation of ritual regulations\n!

By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Still more important in the present context is the fact that [[Tertullian]] speaks of the Lord's Supper (the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] \"\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd ''\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd''\") precisely as the \"dominicum ''convivium''\" (see [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.uxor2.shtml Ad uxorem 2:4:2], and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.v.ii.iv.html translation]).</ref> The number of participants at such meals in private houses, as opposed to other specially designated places, would be at most a dozen.<ref>\"The term ''convivium'' labels a late afternoon or evening meal taking place in a domestic dining room or garden, hosted by the proprietor of the residence, involving some combination of family members and guests numbering anywhere from a very few up to perhaps a dozen (nine is an ideal but not necessarily standard number), and ordinarily employing a single ''triclinium'', the three-sided arrangement of couches commonly used for dining during the period of this study. ... \"civic\" dining, which occurred on special occasions such as festivals, was publicly sponsored or paid for by a single donor, and might involve large numbers of people spread over many triclinia in the public spaces of cities and towns; or, alternatively, involved a college of priests or magistrates whose meals might be paid for publicly or by an endowment, and might occur in specially designated spaces.\" ([http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8190.html Matthew B. Roller: ''Dining Posture in Ancient Rome: Bodies, Values, and Status'', Introduction])</ref> The symposium after the meal was the time for teaching and conversation, for the singing of hymns, for the contributions of those who prophesied or spoke in tongues.<ref name=Smith/>\n\n====Mystery cults====\nParallel to the religious duties to god and state, \"the Hellenic world also fostered a number of 'underground' religions, which countless thousands of people found intellectually and emotionally satisfying.\"<ref name=\"Harris, Stephen L. p 286\">Harris, Stephen L.

Jewish feast practices had taken on Hellenic forms as noted above. [[Dionysus]] was \"god of 'the vine' - representing wine, the most universally popular beverage in the ancient world.\" <ref>Harris, Stephen L., ''Understanding the Bible.'' (Mayfield Publishing Company 4th ed.) p. 287.{{ISBN|1559346558}}</ref> [[Barry B.

With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe.  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine. When Dionysus shows the grape cluster where he got the wine from, Tatius parodies the Christian eucharist rite.<ref>Reardon, B.P., ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'' (University of California Press 2nd ed.) p. 192.</ref>\n\n====Totem-sacrifices====\nIn the chapter \"Totem-Sacrifices and Eucharists\" of his 1920 book ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'', [[Edward Carpenter]] advanced the theory that the Christian Eucharist arose from an almost universal practice of a tribe occasionally eating the animal that it identified with, a practice that he saw as developing into ceremonial eatings of shared food by lamas in Nepal and Tibet, ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, Peruvians, Chinese and Tartars. He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.

These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

In the 18th century, ''[[Pietism|Pietist]]'' Christians began to hold [[Agape feast|''Love Feasts'']] that looked back to the ancient ''Agape''. Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education. Others hold ritual Agape meals.<ref>Sample services can be consulted at [http://thebillabong.info/otm_lent/otm07_p19.html An Agape for Easter] and [http://thebillabong.info/otm_pcost/otm47_p22.html A Pentecost Agape]</ref> -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Paintings of the Last Supper}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUY2AslyF4C Enrico Mazza: \"The Eucharist in the First Four Centuries\", in Anscar J.

Paul's nascent congregation there was made up of pagan, not Jewish, converts ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:2}}). All first-generation Christians were necessarily converts, either pagan or Jewish.  They had written him regarding numerous matters of concern ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1}}).  Criticizing what he had heard of their meetings, at which they had communal meals, one paragraph in Paul's response reminded them about what he asserted he had \"received from the Lord\" and had \"passed on\" about Jesus' actions and directives at his Last Supper. The ambiguities some find in that wording has generated reams of books, articles and opinions about the Origins of  Eucharist. \n\nIn his 1994 book, ''A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles'', [[Bruce Chilton]] wrote that Paul \"indeed 'received from the Lord' (1 Corinthians 11:23), through Cephas (Galatians 1:18), what he 'handed over' (1 Corinthians 11:23) to his hearers. \u2026 He reminds his hearers of what he already had taught as authoritative, a teaching 'from the Lord' and presumably warranted by the earliest 'pillars': in that sense, what he hands on is not his own, but derives from his highest authority, 'the Lord' (11:23).\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTQZ__LDiJ4C A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles, by Bruce Chilton 1994] {{ISBN|9004099492}} p. 110</ref>  Eugene LaVerdiere wrote: \"That is how Paul introduced the tradition, presenting himself as a link in the chain of Eucharistic tradition.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.  I cannot believe that they knew about those elements and studiously avoided them.  I can only presume that they were not there for everyone from the beginning, that is, from solemn formal and final institution by Jesus himself.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, \"The Historical Jesus\" HarperCollins 1992 p. 364</ref></blockquote>\nPaul's first letter to the Corinthians, in the context of correcting the habits of the Corinthians serves to reestablish \"the Pre-Pauline tradition, ritual of bread/body + meal + ritual of cup/blood.\" <ref>Crossan, John Dominic \"The Birth of Christianity, Harper/Collins, 2002, p. 436</ref>  Hellenized Jew Paul references a Greek weekly Lord's Supper, which is not an annual Jewish Passover meal, and does not have the participants giving thanks (\"Eucharistia\"), rather the purpose is to proclaim Jesus' death until he comes again, in the manner of Hellenic societies formed \"to hold meals in remembrance of those who had died and to drink a cup in honor of some god.\"<ref>Funk, ibid. at 139\u2013140</ref> Some authors would consider Paul to be the \"Founder\" of the Eucharist in a pagan context appealing to the Jewish prohibition against drinking blood, the pervasive history of Greek memorial dining societies, and Paul's own hellenistic background.\"<ref>Funk, Robert, and the Jesus Seminar, \"The Acts of Jesus\" Harper Collins, 1998, p. 139</ref> Paul, however, explicitly stated that he was rehearsing a Christian tradition, something that he himself had \"received\" and had already \"handed on\" to the Corinthians.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaFu25KmgiIC&pg=PA425&dq=paul+eucharist+corinthians&hl=en&ei=I58eTtnEH4exhQeYk_WnAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=paul%20eucharist%20corinthians&f=false Raymond F.

Crossan maintains that table fellowship was central to Jesus' ministry in that was infamous for violating codes of honor to eat freely with outsiders, termed \"sinners and tax collectors\" in the Gospels. Jesus presumably taught at the table, as was customary. This emphasis on table fellowship is reflected in the large number of eating scenes in early Christian art.<ref name=\"EJ\">Crossan, John Dominic. The essential Jesus. Edison: Castle Books. 1998.</ref> In the Jerusalem tradition, of James and Peter, the ''meal'' is of higher importance than blood and body since the Didache fails to mention them.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev.

The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation. The historical fact is that the Last Supper was not a Passover celebration and, consequently, that its liturgy was not that of the Jewish Passover.\"<ref>The Celebration of the Eucharist: The Origin of the Rite and the Development of Its Interpretation [Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999] pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nJoachim Jeremias, having rejected the previous two possible backgrounds for the Last Supper argues forcibly that it was a ''Passover Seder'' while recognising that there are difficulties.  His case may be summed as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Was the Last Supper a Passover Seder?  according to Joachim Jeremias<ref>[http://www.abcog.org/green1.htm Eucharistic Sacrifice in the New Testament]</ref>\n|-\n! Ten factors substantiating Passover\n! Nine factors in objection to Passover actions that would be in violation of ritual regulations\n!

By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Jewish feast practices had taken on Hellenic forms as noted above.

Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine.

He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.

These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

In the 18th century, ''[[Pietism|Pietist]]'' Christians began to hold [[Agape feast|''Love Feasts'']] that looked back to the ancient ''Agape''. Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education. Others hold ritual Agape meals.<ref>Sample services can be consulted at [http://thebillabong.info/otm_lent/otm07_p19.html An Agape for Easter] and [http://thebillabong.info/otm_pcost/otm47_p22.html A Pentecost Agape]</ref> -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Paintings of the Last Supper}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUY2AslyF4C Enrico Mazza: \"The Eucharist in the First Four Centuries\", in Anscar J.

However, despite the fact that both deny the certainty of objects' true existence, the nihilist would deny the existence of [[self (philosophy)|self]] whereas the solipsist would affirm it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/|title=Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}</ref> Both these positions are considered forms of [[anti-realism]].\n\n=== Epistemological ===\n{{Main|Epistemological nihilism}}\nEpistemological nihilism is a form of [[Epistemological nihilism|skepticism]] in which all knowledge is accepted as being possibly untrue or as being impossible to confirm as true.\n\n=== Mereological ===\n{{Main|Mereological nihilism}}\nMereological nihilism (also called compositional nihilism) is the position that objects with proper parts do not exist (not only objects in space, but also objects existing in time do not have any temporal parts), and only basic building blocks without parts exist, and thus the world we see and experience full of objects with parts is a product of human misperception (i.e., if we could see clearly, we would not perceive compositive objects).\n\nThis interpretation of existence must be based on resolution. The resolution with which humans see and perceive the \"improper parts\" of the world is not an objective fact of reality, but is rather an implicit trait that can only be qualitatively explored and expressed. Therefore, there is no arguable way to surmise or measure the validity of mereological nihilism. Example: An ant can get lost on a large cylindrical object because the circumference of the object is so large with respect to the ant that the ant effectively feels as though the object has no curvature. Thus, the resolution with which the ant views the world it exists \"within\" is a very important determining factor in how the ant experiences this \"within the world\" feeling.\n\n=== Existential ===\n{{main|Existential nihilism}}\n[[File:Merwart-Nihilist.jpg|thumb|''The Nihilist'' by [[Paul Merwart]] (1882)]]\n\nExistential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The meaninglessness or meaning of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]].\n\n=== Moral ===\n{{Main|Moral nihilism}}\nMoral nihilism, also known as ethical nihilism, is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that there is no morality whatsoever; therefore, no action is preferable to any other. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is neither right nor wrong. Moral nihilism is distinct from [[moral relativism]], which acknowledges individual or cultural moral values.\n\nOther nihilists may argue not that there is no morality, but that if it does exist, it is a human construction and thus artificial, wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes. As an example, if someone kills someone else, such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing, or bad independently from our moral beliefs, because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy. What is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good: as a result, killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live, which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting. In this way, such a nihilist believes that all moral claims are void of any objective truth value. An alternative scholarly perspective is that moral nihilism is a morality in itself. Cooper writes, \"In the widest sense of the word 'morality', moral nihilism is a morality.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Moral Nihilism | journal = Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society | first = Neil | last = Cooper | volume = 74 | issue = 1973-1974 | pages = 75\u201390 | jstor = 4544850}}</ref>\n\n=== Political ===\nPolitical nihilism follows the characteristic nihilist's rejection of non-rationalized or non-proven assertions; in this case the necessity of the most fundamental social and political structures, such as [[government]], [[family]], and [[law]]. An influential analysis of political nihilism is presented by [[Leo Strauss]].<ref>L. Strauss, \"German Nihilism\", ''Interpretation'' 26 (3) (1999): pp. 353\u2013378.</ref>\n\n==== Russian movement ====\n{{main|Russian nihilist movement}}\nThe Russian Nihilist movement was a Russian trend in the 1860s that rejected all authority.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=anarchism&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] s.v. \"nihilism\"</ref> After the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881, the Nihilists gained a reputation throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence for political change.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Nihilists expressed anger at what they described as the abusive nature of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and of the tsarist monarchy, and at the domination of the Russian economy by the aristocracy. Although the term ''Nihilism'' was coined by the German theologian [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743\u20131818), its widespread usage began with the 1862 novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' by the Russian author [[Ivan Turgenev]]. The main character of the novel, Yevgeny Bazarov, who describes himself as a Nihilist, wants to educate the people. The \"go to the people{{spaced ndash}}be the people\" campaign reached its height in the 1870s, during which underground groups such as the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|People's Will]], and [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]] formed. It became known as the [[Narodnik]] movement, whose members believed that the newly freed [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] were merely being sold into [[wage slavery]] in the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and that the middle and upper classes had effectively replaced landowners. The Russian state attempted to suppress the nihilist movement. In actions described by the Nihilists as [[propaganda of the deed]] many government officials were assassinated. In 1881 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] was killed on the very day he had approved a proposal to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms.\n\n=== Medical ===\nMedical nihilism is the view that we should have little confidence in the effectiveness of medical interventions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medical Nihilism|last=Stegenga|first=Jacob|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-19-874704-8|location=Oxford, UK|pages=1}}</ref> Jacob Stegenga proposed the term in the book ''Medical Nihilism''.

In the Doctrine of Nihilism in the Apannaka Sutta, the Buddha describes moral nihilists as holding the following views:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Apannaka Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli & Bikkhu Bodhi</ref><ref>Note 425, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli & Bikkhu Bodhi</ref>\n\n* Giving produces no beneficial results\n* Good and bad actions produce no results\n* After death, beings are not reborn into the present world or into another world\n* There is no one in the world who, through direct knowledge, can confirm that beings are reborn into this world or into another world\n\nThe Buddha then states that those who hold these views will not see the danger in misconduct and the blessings in good conduct and will, therefore, avoid good bodily, verbal and mental conduct; practicing misconduct instead.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Nirvana and nihilism====\nThe culmination of the path that the Buddha taught was Nirvana, \"a place of nothingness... nonpossession and... non-attachment...

He describes this as an anxiety caused by the false belief in an unchanging, everlasting 'self'. All things are subject to change and taking any impermanent phenomena to be a 'self' causes suffering. Nonetheless, his critics called him a nihilist who teaches the annihilation and extermination of an existing being. The Buddha's response was that he only teaches the cessation of suffering. When an individual has given up craving and the conceit of 'I am' their mind is liberated, they no longer come into any state of 'being' and are no longer born again.<ref name=nikaya>{{cite book |title=Alagaddupama Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha |translator-first=Bikkhu |translator-last=Nanamoli |translator2-first=Bikkhu |translator2-last=Bodhi |url=http://lirs.ru/lib/sutra/The_Middle_Length_Discourses(Majjhima_Nikaya),Nanamoli,Bodhi,1995.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Aggivacchagotta Sutta records a conversation between the Buddha and an individual named Vaccha that further elaborates on this. In it Vaccha asks the Buddha to confirm one of the following, with respect to the existence of the Buddha after death:<ref name=Bhikkhu>{{cite book |title=Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire |translator-first=Thanissaro |translator-last=Bhikkhu |translator-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html |year=1997 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref>\n\n* After death a Buddha reappears somewhere else\n* After death a Buddha does not reappear\n* After death a Buddha both does and does not reappear\n* After death a Buddha neither does nor does not reappear\n\nTo all four questions, the Buddha answers that the terms 'appear', 'not appear', 'does and does not reappear' and 'neither does nor does not reappear' do not apply. When Vaccha expresses puzzlement, the Buddha asks Vaccha a counter question to the effect of: if a fire were to go out and someone were to ask you whether the fire went north, south, east or west, how would you reply? Vaccha replies that the question does not apply and that an extinguished fire can only be classified as 'out'.<ref name=Bhikkhu/>\n\nThanissaro Bikkhu elaborates on the classification problem around the words 'reappear' etc. with respect to the Buddha and Nirvana by stating that a \"person who has attained the goal [Nirvana] is thus indescribable because [they have] abandoned all things by which [they] could be described\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html |title=Mind Like Fire Unbound |chapter='This fire that has gone out... in which direction from here has it gone?' |edition=Fourth |first=Thanissaro |last=Bhikkhu |author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |year=1999 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref> The Suttas themselves describe the liberated mind as 'untraceable' or as 'consciousness without feature', making no distinction between the mind of a liberated being that is alive and the mind of one that is no longer alive.<ref name=nikaya/><ref>{{cite book |title=Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta: To Kevatta|translator-first=Thanissaro |translator-last=Bhikkhu |translator-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html |year=1997 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Buddha's explanations to the contrary, Buddhist practitioners may, at times, still approach Buddhism in a nihilistic manner. Ajahn Amaro illustrates this by retelling the story of a Buddhist monk, Ajahn Sumedho, who in his early years took a nihilistic approach to Nirvana. A distinct feature of Nirvana in Buddhism is that an individual attaining it is no longer subject to rebirth. Ajahn Sumedho, during a conversation with his teacher Ajahn Chah, comments that he is \"determined above all things to fully realize Nirvana in this lifetime... deeply weary of the human condition and ... [is] determined not to be born again\". To this, Ajahn Chah replies: \"what about the rest of us, Sumedho? Don't you care about those who'll be left behind?\" Ajahn Amaro comments that Ajahn Chah could detect that his student had a nihilistic aversion to life rather than true detachment.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.amaravati.org/the-view-from-the-centre/ |title=A Dhamma article by Ajahn Amaro \u2013 The View from the Centre |date=7 May 2015 |access-date=24 June 2019 |work=[[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] |orig-year=2008 |first=Ajahn |last=Amaro}}</ref> It is to be noted, however, that Ajahn Chah's answer clearly points to the Mahayana concept of the [[Bodhisattva]], i.e. the consummated practitioner who renounces to obtain his own Nirvana and procrastinates his own liberation until everyone else has obtained it. Such concept is not to be found in the Theravada tradition as expressed in the Pali canon, which is mainly focused on individual liberation through the [[four stages of enlightenment]] culminating with the Arahant stage. Therefore, Ajahn Sumedho was correct in his interpretation of the teachings, and Ajahn Chah sought to mitigate and soften the nihilistic content of the original Theravada tradition blending Hinayana and Mahayana concepts.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Turgenev by Repin.jpg|thumb|The novelist [[Ivan S. Turgenev]] made the term nihilism popular.]]\nThe term ''nihilism'' was first used by [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743\u20131819). Jacobi used the term to characterize [[rationalism]]<ref>George di Giovanni, ''Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi'', The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ Stanford.edu]</ref> and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s \"critical\" philosophy to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]] according to which all rationalism (philosophy as criticism) reduces to nihilism\u2014and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]]. Bret W. Davis writes, for example, \"The first philosophical development of the idea of nihilism is generally ascribed to Friedrich Jacobi, who in a famous letter criticized [[Fichte]]'s idealism as falling into nihilism. According to Jacobi, Fichte's absolutization of the ego (the 'absolute I' that posits the 'not-I') is an inflation of subjectivity that denies the absolute transcendence of God.\"<ref>Davis, Bret W. - \"Zen After Zarathustra: The Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism\" ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' Issue 28 (2004):89-138 (here 107).</ref> A related but oppositional concept is [[fideism]], which sees reason as hostile and inferior to faith.\n\nWith the popularizing of the word ''nihilism'' by [[Ivan Turgenev]], a new Russian political movement called the [[Nihilist movement]] adopted the term.

Though the notion appears frequently throughout Nietzsche's work, he uses the term in a variety of ways, with different meanings and connotations. [[Karen L. Carr]] describes Nietzsche's characterization of nihilism \"as a condition of tension, as a disproportion between what we want to value (or need) and how the world appears to operate.\"<ref>Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, p. 25.</ref> When we find out that the world does not possess the objective value or meaning that we want it to have or have long since believed it to have, we find ourselves in a crisis.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:6 [25]</ref> Nietzsche asserts that with the decline of Christianity and the rise of physiological decadence,{{clarify|reason=\"Physiological\" normally refers specifically to living biochemical processes; this seems to rather be \"material (or materialistic) decadence\"|date=December 2015}} nihilism is in fact characteristic of the modern age,<ref name=Michels>Steven Michels, \"Nietzsche, Nihilism, and the Virtue of Nature\", Dogma, 2004, [http://dogma.free.fr/txt/SM-Nietzsche.htm Free.fr]</ref> though he implies that the rise of nihilism is still incomplete and that it has yet to be overcome.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:10 [142]</ref> Though the problem of nihilism becomes especially explicit in Nietzsche's [[Nachlass|notebooks]] (published posthumously), it is mentioned repeatedly in his published works and is closely connected to many of the problems mentioned there.\n\nNietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value. This observation stems in part from Nietzsche's [[perspectivism]], or his notion that \"knowledge\" is always by someone of some thing: it is always bound by perspective, and it is never mere fact.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 13:14 [22]</ref> Rather, there are interpretations through which we understand the world and give it meaning. Interpreting is something we can not go without; in fact, it is something we ''need''. One way of interpreting the world is through morality, as one of the fundamental ways that people make sense of the world, especially in regard to their own thoughts and actions. Nietzsche distinguishes a morality that is strong or healthy, meaning that the person in question is aware that he constructs it himself, from weak morality, where the interpretation is projected on to something external.\n\nNietzsche discusses Christianity, one of the major topics in his work, at length in the context of the problem of nihilism in his notebooks, in a chapter entitled \"European Nihilism\".<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:5 [71]</ref> Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[humanism|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[theodicee|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. However, it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing: in its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution. It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity \"not because we lived too far from it, rather because we lived too close\".<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [200]</ref> As such, the self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism. Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as ''the'' interpretation, Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond [[skepticism]] to a distrust of ''all'' meaning.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [127]</ref><ref>Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'' (1992), pp. 41\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Rosen]] identifies Nietzsche's concept of nihilism with a situation of meaninglessness, in which \"everything is permitted.\" According to him, the loss of higher metaphysical values that exist in contrast to the base reality of the world, or merely human ideas, gives rise to the idea that all human ideas are therefore valueless. Rejecting idealism thus results in nihilism, because only similarly transcendent ideals live up to the previous standards that the nihilist still implicitly holds.<ref>[[Stanley Rosen|Rosen, Stanley]]. ''Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]]. 1969. p. xiii.</ref> The inability for Christianity to serve as a source of valuating the world is reflected in Nietzsche's famous [[aphorism]] of the madman in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>F. Nietzsche, ''[[The Gay Science]]'': 125.</ref> The death of God, in particular the statement that \"we killed him\", is similar to the ''self''-dissolution of Christian doctrine: due to the advances of the sciences, which for Nietzsche show that man is the product of [[evolution]], that Earth has no [[geocentrism|special place]] among the stars and that [[history]] is not [[progress (history)|progressive]], the Christian notion of God can no longer serve as a basis for a morality.\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western Buddhism#Buddhism and Western Intellectuals|Western Buddhism]], advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to [[nothing]]ness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This mowing away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears inconsistent: this \"will to nothingness\" is still a form of willing.<ref>F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7.</ref> He describes this as \"an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists:\"\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought ''not'' to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos&nbsp;\u2013 at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]],'' section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}\n\nNietzsche's relation to the problem of nihilism is a complex one. He approaches the problem of nihilism as deeply personal, stating that this predicament of the modern world is a problem that has \"become conscious\" in him.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure.<ref name=\"Michels\"/>\n\nHe states that there is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity's self-dissolution, one that does ''not'' stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness. This alternate, 'active' nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new. This form of nihilism is characterized by Nietzsche as \"a sign of strength,\"<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [35]</ref> a willful destruction of the old values to wipe the slate clean and lay down one's own beliefs and interpretations, contrary to the passive nihilism that resigns itself with the decomposition of the old values. This willful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning, this active nihilism, could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a 'free spirit'<ref>K. Carr, ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, pp. 43\u201350.</ref> or the ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'' from ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives his life as if it were his own work of art. It may be questioned, though, whether \"active nihilism\" is indeed the correct term for this stance, and some question whether Nietzsche takes the problems nihilism poses seriously enough.<ref>J. Doomen, \"Consistent Nihilism\", ''[[Journal of Mind and Behavior]]'' 33 (1/2) (2012): pp. 103\u2013117.</ref>\n\n===Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche===\n[[Martin Heidegger]]'s interpretation of Nietzsche influenced many postmodern thinkers who investigated the problem of nihilism as put forward by Nietzsche. Only recently has Heidegger's influence on Nietzschean nihilism research faded.<ref>\"Heideggers, Aus-einander-setzung' mit Nietzsches hat mannigfache Resonanz gefunden. Das Verh\u00e4ltnis der beiden Philosophen zueinander ist dabei von unterschiedlichen Positionen aus diskutiert worden. Inzwischen ist es nicht mehr ungew\u00f6hnlich, da\u00df Heidegger, entgegen seinem Anspruch auf, Verwindung' der Metaphysik und des ihr zugeh\u00f6rigen Nihilismus, in jenen Nihilismus zur\u00fcckgestellt wird, als dessen Vollender er Nietzsche angesehen hat.\" [[Wolfgang M\u00fcller-Lauter]], ''Heidegger und Nietzsche. Nietzsche-Interpretationen III'', Berlin-New York 2000, p. 303.</ref> As early as the 1930s, Heidegger was giving lectures on Nietzsche's thought.<ref>Cf. both by Heidegger: Vol. I, ''Nietzsche I'' (1936-39). Translated as ''Nietzsche I: The Will to Power as Art'' by David F. Krell (New York: Harper & Row, 1979); Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as \"The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper & Row, 1984).</ref> Given the importance of Nietzsche's contribution to the topic of nihilism, Heidegger's influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important for the historical development of the term ''nihilism''.\n\nHeidegger's method of researching and teaching Nietzsche is explicitly his own. He does not specifically try to present Nietzsche ''as'' Nietzsche. He rather tries to incorporate Nietzsche's thoughts into his own philosophical system of [[Heidegger#Philosophy|Being, Time and ''Dasein'']].<ref>\"Indem Heidegger das von Nietzsche Ungesagte im Hinblick auf die Seinsfrage zur Sprache zu bringen sucht, wird das von Nietzsche Gesagte in ein diesem selber fremdes Licht ger\u00fcckt.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 267.</ref> In his ''Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being'' (1944\u201346),<ref>Original German: ''Die seinsgeschichtliche Bestimmung des Nihilismus''. Found in the second volume of his lectures: Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as \"The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper & Row, 1984).</ref> Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche's nihilism as trying to achieve a victory through the devaluation of the, until then, highest values. The principle of this devaluation is, according to Heidegger, the [[will to power]]. The will to power is also the principle of every earlier ''valuation'' of values.<ref>\n\"Heidegger geht davon aus, da\u00df Nietzsche den Nihilismus als Entwertung der bisherigen obersten Werte versteht; seine \u00dcberwindung soll durch die Umwertung der Werte erfolgen. Das Prinzip der Umwertung wie auch jeder fr\u00fcheren Wertsetzung ist der Wille zur Macht.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.</ref> How does this devaluation occur and why is this nihilistic? One of Heidegger's main critiques on philosophy is that philosophy, and more specifically metaphysics, has forgotten to discriminate between investigating the notion of ''a'' being (''Seiende'') and ''Being'' (''Sein''). According to Heidegger, the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of metaphysics. And because metaphysics has forgotten to ask about the notion of Being (what Heidegger calls ''[[:de:Seinsvergessenheit|Seinsvergessenheit]]''), it is a history about the destruction of Being. That is why Heidegger calls metaphysics nihilistic.<ref>\"What remains unquestioned and forgotten in metaphysics is being; and hence, it is nihilistic.\", [http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/ UTM.edu], visited on November 24, 2009.</ref> This makes Nietzsche's metaphysics not a victory over nihilism, but a perfection of it.<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.</ref>\n\nHeidegger, in his interpretation of Nietzsche, has been inspired by [[Ernst J\u00fcnger]]. Many references to J\u00fcnger can be found in Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche. For example, in a letter to the rector of Freiburg University of November 4, 1945, Heidegger, inspired by J\u00fcnger, tries to explain the notion of \"[[God is dead]]\" as the \"reality of the Will to Power.\" Heidegger also praises J\u00fcnger for defending Nietzsche against a too biological or anthropological reading during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 272-275.</ref>\n\nHeidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche influenced a number of important postmodernist thinkers. [[Gianni Vattimo]] points at a back-and-forth movement in European thought, between Nietzsche and Heidegger. During the 1960s, a Nietzschean 'renaissance' began, culminating in the work of [[Mazzino Montinari]] and [[Giorgio Colli]]. They began work on a new and complete edition of Nietzsche's collected works, making Nietzsche more accessible for scholarly research. Vattimo explains that with this new edition of Colli and Montinari, a critical reception of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape. Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers, Vattimo does not want, or only partially wants, to rely on Heidegger for understanding Nietzsche. On the other hand, Vattimo judges Heidegger's intentions authentic enough to keep pursuing them.<ref>\nM\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 301-303.</ref> Philosophers who Vattimo exemplifies as a part of this back and forth movement are French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]. Italian philosophers of this same movement are [[Massimo Cacciari|Cacciari]], [[Emanuele Severino|Severino]] and himself.<ref>\"Er (Vattimo) konstatiert, in vielen europ\u00e4ischen Philosophien eine Hin- und Herbewegung zwischen Heidegger und Nietzsche\". Dabei denkt er, wie seine sp\u00e4teren Ausf\u00fchrungen zeigen, z.B. an Deleuze, Foucault und Derrida auf franz\u00f6sischer Seite, an Cacciari, Severino und an sich selbst auf italienischer Seite.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 302.</ref> [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and [[Richard Rorty]] are also philosophers who are influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche.<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 303\u2013304.</ref>\n\n=== Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche ===\n[[Gilles Deleuze]]'s interpretation of Nietzsche's concept of nihilism is different - in some sense diametrically opposed - to the usual definition (as outlined in the rest of this article). Nihilism is one of the main topics of Deleuze's early book ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Philosophy|last=Deleuze|first=Gilles|publisher=The Athlone Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-231-13877-2|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Tomlinson|translator-first=Hugh|orig-year=1962}}</ref> There, Deleuze repeatedly interprets Nietzsche's nihilism as \"the enterprise of denying life and depreciating existence\".<ref>Deleuze, ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p.34.</ref> Nihilism thus defined is therefore not the denial of higher values, or the denial of meaning, but rather the depreciation of life in the name of such higher values or meaning. Deleuze therefore (with, he claims, Nietzsche) says that Christianity and Platonism, and with them the whole of metaphysics, are intrinsically nihilist.\n\n===Postmodernism===\n[[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodern]] and [[poststructuralist]] thought has questioned the very grounds on which [[Western culture]]s have based their 'truths': absolute knowledge and meaning, a 'decentralization' of authorship, the accumulation of positive knowledge, historical progress, and certain ideals and practices of [[humanism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].\n\n==== Derrida ====\n[[Jacques Derrida]], whose [[deconstruction]] is perhaps most commonly labeled nihilistic, did not himself make the nihilistic move that others have claimed. Derridean deconstructionists argue that this approach rather frees texts, individuals or organizations from a restrictive truth, and that deconstruction opens up the possibility of other ways of being.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/specials/derrida/josenihil.htm Borginho, Jose] 1999; Nihilism and Affirmation. Retrieved 05-12-07.</ref> [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], for example, uses deconstruction to create an ethics of opening up Western scholarship to the voice of the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and to philosophies outside of the canon of western texts.<ref>Spivak, Chakravorty Gayatri; 1988; Can The Subaltern Speak?; in Nelson, Cary and Grossberg, Lawrence (eds); 1988; Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture; Macmillan Education, Basingstoke.</ref> Derrida himself built a philosophy based upon a 'responsibility to the other'.<ref>Reynolds, Jack; 2001; [http://www.mic.ul.ie/stephen/derrida.pdf The Other of Derridean Deconstruction: Levinas, Phenomenology and the Question of Responsibility]; Minerva - An Internet Journal of Philosophy 5: 31\u201362. Retrieved 05-12-07.</ref> Deconstruction can thus be seen not as a denial of truth, but as a denial of our ability to know truth. That is to say, it makes an [[epistemological]] claim, compared to nihilism's [[ontological]] claim.\n\n==== Lyotard ====\n[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard|Lyotard]] argues that, rather than relying on an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] truth or method to prove their claims, philosophers legitimize their truths by reference to a story about the world that can't be separated from the age and system the stories belong to\u2014referred to by Lyotard as ''[[Metanarrative|meta-narratives]].'' He then goes on to define the [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]] as characterized by a rejection both of these meta-narratives and of the process of [[legitimation]] by meta-narratives.\n\n<blockquote>In lieu of meta-narratives we have created new [[language-game]]s in order to legitimize our claims which rely on changing relationships and mutable truths, none of which is privileged over the other to speak to ultimate truth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} </blockquote>\n\nThis concept of the instability of truth and meaning leads in the direction of nihilism, though Lyotard stops short of embracing the latter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==== Baudrillard ====\nPostmodern theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] wrote briefly of nihilism from the postmodern viewpoint in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. He stuck mainly to topics of interpretations of the real world over the simulations of which the real world is composed. The uses of meaning were an important subject in Baudrillard's discussion of nihilism:\n\n{{quote|The [[apocalypse]] is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of indifference...all that remains, is the fascination for desertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general situation in an era of involuntary transparency.|Jean Baudrillard, ''Simulacra and Simulation'', \"On Nihilism\", trans. 1995{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}}}\n\n===Transcendentalism or methodological naturalism===\nIn ''Nihil Unbound: Extinction and Enlightenment'', [[Ray Brassier]] maintains that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of [[extinction]], instead attempting to find meaning in a world conditioned by the very idea of its own annihilation. Thus Brassier critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of Continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like [[Gilles Deleuze]], who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the \"threat\" of nihilism. Instead, drawing on thinkers such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle]], [[Paul Churchland]], and [[Thomas Metzinger]], Brassier defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning. That is, rather than avoiding nihilism, Brassier embraces it as the truth of reality. Brassier concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing,<ref>Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 148\u2013149.</ref> but also that philosophy is the \"organon of extinction,\" that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all.<ref>Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 223\u2013226, 234\u2013238.</ref> Brassier then defends a radically anti-correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being, but with Non-Being.\n\n== In culture ==\n===Dada===\nThe term ''[[Dadaism|Dada]]'' was first used by [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] in 1916.<ref>de Micheli, Mario (2006). ''Las vanguardias art\u00edsticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. pp. 135-137.</ref> The movement, which lasted from approximately 1916 to 1923, arose during [[World War I]], an event that influenced the artists.<ref name=\"Tzara\">Tzara, Tristan (December 2005).

''Las vanguardias art\u00edsticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma, p. 137.</ref> The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art movement, but an [[anti-art]] movement, sometimes using found objects in a manner similar to [[found poetry]].\n\nThe \"anti-art\" drive is thought{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to have stemmed from a [[post-war]] emptiness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} This tendency toward devaluation of art has led many{{Who|date=April 2018}} to claim that Dada was an essentially nihilistic movement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Given that Dada created its own means for interpreting its products, it is difficult to classify alongside most other contemporary art expressions. Due to perceived ambiguity, it has been classified as a nihilistic ''[[modus vivendi]]''.<ref name=\"Tzara\" />\n\n===Literature===\nThe term \"nihilism\" was actually popularized in 1862 by [[Ivan Turgenev]] in his novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]],'' whose hero, Bazarov, was a nihilist and recruited several followers to the philosophy. He found his nihilistic ways challenged upon falling in love.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism | title = Nihilism | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Martin | date = April 1, 2012| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Anton Chekhov]] portrayed nihilism when writing ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''. The phrase \"what does it matter\" or variants of this are often spoken by several characters in response to events; the significance of some of these events suggests a subscription to nihilism by said characters as a type of coping strategy.\n\nThe philosophical ideas of the French author, the [[Marquis de Sade]], are often noted as early examples of nihilistic principles.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1312938684 | title = Nihilism: Philosophy of Nothingness | publisher = Google Books | date = January 5, 2015| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Absurdism]]\n* [[Acosmism]]\n* [[Agnosticism]]\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anatta]]\n* [[Anti-art]] and [[Anti-anti-art]]\n* [[Anti-humanism]]\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Apatheism]]\n* [[Apathy]]\n* [[Cosmicism]]\n* [[Cynicism (philosophy)]]\n* [[Dao De Jing]]\n* [[Dysteleology]]\n* [[Rational egoism|Egoism]]\n* [[Eliminative materialism]]\n* [[Existentialism]]\n* [[Hedonism]]\n* [[U.

However, despite the fact that both deny the certainty of objects' true existence, the nihilist would deny the existence of [[self (philosophy)|self]] whereas the solipsist would affirm it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/|title=Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}</ref> Both these positions are considered forms of [[anti-realism]].\n\n=== Epistemological ===\n{{Main|Epistemological nihilism}}\nEpistemological nihilism is a form of [[Epistemological nihilism|skepticism]] in which all knowledge is accepted as being possibly untrue or as being impossible to confirm as true.\n\n=== Mereological ===\n{{Main|Mereological nihilism}}\nMereological nihilism (also called compositional nihilism) is the position that objects with proper parts do not exist (not only objects in space, but also objects existing in time do not have any temporal parts), and only basic building blocks without parts exist, and thus the world we see and experience full of objects with parts is a product of human misperception (i.e., if we could see clearly, we would not perceive compositive objects).\n\nThis interpretation of existence must be based on resolution. The resolution with which humans see and perceive the \"improper parts\" of the world is not an objective fact of reality, but is rather an implicit trait that can only be qualitatively explored and expressed. Therefore, there is no arguable way to surmise or measure the validity of mereological nihilism. Example: An ant can get lost on a large cylindrical object because the circumference of the object is so large with respect to the ant that the ant effectively feels as though the object has no curvature. Thus, the resolution with which the ant views the world it exists \"within\" is a very important determining factor in how the ant experiences this \"within the world\" feeling.\n\n=== Existential ===\n{{main|Existential nihilism}}\n[[File:Merwart-Nihilist.jpg|thumb|''The Nihilist'' by [[Paul Merwart]] (1882)]]\n\nExistential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The meaninglessness or meaning of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]].\n\n=== Moral ===\n{{Main|Moral nihilism}}\nMoral nihilism, also known as ethical nihilism, is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that there is no morality whatsoever; therefore, no action is preferable to any other. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is neither right nor wrong. Moral nihilism is distinct from [[moral relativism]], which acknowledges individual or cultural moral values.\n\nOther nihilists may argue not that there is no morality, but that if it does exist, it is a human construction and thus artificial, wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes. As an example, if someone kills someone else, such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing, or bad independently from our moral beliefs, because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy. What is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good: as a result, killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live, which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting. In this way, such a nihilist believes that all moral claims are void of any objective truth value. An alternative scholarly perspective is that moral nihilism is a morality in itself. Cooper writes, \"In the widest sense of the word 'morality', moral nihilism is a morality.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Moral Nihilism | journal = Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society | first = Neil | last = Cooper | volume = 74 | issue = 1973-1974 | pages = 75\u201390 | jstor = 4544850}}</ref>\n\n=== Political ===\nPolitical nihilism follows the characteristic nihilist's rejection of non-rationalized or non-proven assertions; in this case the necessity of the most fundamental social and political structures, such as [[government]], [[family]], and [[law]]. An influential analysis of political nihilism is presented by [[Leo Strauss]].<ref>L. Strauss, \"German Nihilism\", ''Interpretation'' 26 (3) (1999): pp. 353\u2013378.</ref>\n\n==== Russian movement ====\n{{main|Russian nihilist movement}}\nThe Russian Nihilist movement was a Russian trend in the 1860s that rejected all authority.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=anarchism&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] s.v. \"nihilism\"</ref> After the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881, the Nihilists gained a reputation throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence for political change.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Nihilists expressed anger at what they described as the abusive nature of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and of the tsarist monarchy, and at the domination of the Russian economy by the aristocracy. Although the term ''Nihilism'' was coined by the German theologian [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743\u20131818), its widespread usage began with the 1862 novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' by the Russian author [[Ivan Turgenev]]. The main character of the novel, Yevgeny Bazarov, who describes himself as a Nihilist, wants to educate the people. The \"go to the people{{spaced ndash}}be the people\" campaign reached its height in the 1870s, during which underground groups such as the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|People's Will]], and [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]] formed. It became known as the [[Narodnik]] movement, whose members believed that the newly freed [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] were merely being sold into [[wage slavery]] in the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and that the middle and upper classes had effectively replaced landowners. The Russian state attempted to suppress the nihilist movement. In actions described by the Nihilists as [[propaganda of the deed]] many government officials were assassinated. In 1881 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] was killed on the very day he had approved a proposal to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms.\n\n=== Medical ===\nMedical nihilism is the view that we should have little confidence in the effectiveness of medical interventions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medical Nihilism|last=Stegenga|first=Jacob|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-19-874704-8|location=Oxford, UK|pages=1}}</ref> Jacob Stegenga proposed the term in the book ''Medical Nihilism''.

In the Doctrine of Nihilism in the Apannaka Sutta, the Buddha describes moral nihilists as holding the following views:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Apannaka Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli & Bikkhu Bodhi</ref><ref>Note 425, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli & Bikkhu Bodhi</ref>\n\n* Giving produces no beneficial results\n* Good and bad actions produce no results\n* After death, beings are not reborn into the present world or into another world\n* There is no one in the world who, through direct knowledge, can confirm that beings are reborn into this world or into another world\n\nThe Buddha then states that those who hold these views will not see the danger in misconduct and the blessings in good conduct and will, therefore, avoid good bodily, verbal and mental conduct; practicing misconduct instead.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Nirvana and nihilism====\nThe culmination of the path that the Buddha taught was Nirvana, \"a place of nothingness... nonpossession and... non-attachment...

He describes this as an anxiety caused by the false belief in an unchanging, everlasting 'self'. All things are subject to change and taking any impermanent phenomena to be a 'self' causes suffering. Nonetheless, his critics called him a nihilist who teaches the annihilation and extermination of an existing being. The Buddha's response was that he only teaches the cessation of suffering. When an individual has given up craving and the conceit of 'I am' their mind is liberated, they no longer come into any state of 'being' and are no longer born again.<ref name=nikaya>{{cite book |title=Alagaddupama Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha |translator-first=Bikkhu |translator-last=Nanamoli |translator2-first=Bikkhu |translator2-last=Bodhi |url=http://lirs.ru/lib/sutra/The_Middle_Length_Discourses(Majjhima_Nikaya),Nanamoli,Bodhi,1995.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Aggivacchagotta Sutta records a conversation between the Buddha and an individual named Vaccha that further elaborates on this. In it Vaccha asks the Buddha to confirm one of the following, with respect to the existence of the Buddha after death:<ref name=Bhikkhu>{{cite book |title=Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire |translator-first=Thanissaro |translator-last=Bhikkhu |translator-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html |year=1997 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref>\n\n* After death a Buddha reappears somewhere else\n* After death a Buddha does not reappear\n* After death a Buddha both does and does not reappear\n* After death a Buddha neither does nor does not reappear\n\nTo all four questions, the Buddha answers that the terms 'appear', 'not appear', 'does and does not reappear' and 'neither does nor does not reappear' do not apply. When Vaccha expresses puzzlement, the Buddha asks Vaccha a counter question to the effect of: if a fire were to go out and someone were to ask you whether the fire went north, south, east or west, how would you reply? Vaccha replies that the question does not apply and that an extinguished fire can only be classified as 'out'.<ref name=Bhikkhu/>\n\nThanissaro Bikkhu elaborates on the classification problem around the words 'reappear' etc. with respect to the Buddha and Nirvana by stating that a \"person who has attained the goal [Nirvana] is thus indescribable because [they have] abandoned all things by which [they] could be described\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html |title=Mind Like Fire Unbound |chapter='This fire that has gone out... in which direction from here has it gone?' |edition=Fourth |first=Thanissaro |last=Bhikkhu |author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |year=1999 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref> The Suttas themselves describe the liberated mind as 'untraceable' or as 'consciousness without feature', making no distinction between the mind of a liberated being that is alive and the mind of one that is no longer alive.<ref name=nikaya/><ref>{{cite book |title=Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta: To Kevatta|translator-first=Thanissaro |translator-last=Bhikkhu |translator-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html |year=1997 |access-date=24 June 2019 |via=[[Accesstoinsight.org]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Buddha's explanations to the contrary, Buddhist practitioners may, at times, still approach Buddhism in a nihilistic manner. Ajahn Amaro illustrates this by retelling the story of a Buddhist monk, Ajahn Sumedho, who in his early years took a nihilistic approach to Nirvana. A distinct feature of Nirvana in Buddhism is that an individual attaining it is no longer subject to rebirth. Ajahn Sumedho, during a conversation with his teacher Ajahn Chah, comments that he is \"determined above all things to fully realize Nirvana in this lifetime... deeply weary of the human condition and ... [is] determined not to be born again\". To this, Ajahn Chah replies: \"what about the rest of us, Sumedho? Don't you care about those who'll be left behind?\" Ajahn Amaro comments that Ajahn Chah could detect that his student had a nihilistic aversion to life rather than true detachment.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.amaravati.org/the-view-from-the-centre/ |title=A Dhamma article by Ajahn Amaro \u2013 The View from the Centre |date=7 May 2015 |access-date=24 June 2019 |work=[[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] |orig-year=2008 |first=Ajahn |last=Amaro}}</ref> It is to be noted, however, that Ajahn Chah's answer clearly points to the Mahayana concept of the [[Bodhisattva]], i.e. the consummated practitioner who renounces to obtain his own Nirvana and procrastinates his own liberation until everyone else has obtained it. Such concept is not to be found in the Theravada tradition as expressed in the Pali canon, which is mainly focused on individual liberation through the [[four stages of enlightenment]] culminating with the Arahant stage. Therefore, Ajahn Sumedho was correct in his interpretation of the teachings, and Ajahn Chah sought to mitigate and soften the nihilistic content of the original Theravada tradition blending Hinayana and Mahayana concepts.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Turgenev by Repin.jpg|thumb|The novelist [[Ivan S. Turgenev]] made the term nihilism popular.]]\nThe term ''nihilism'' was first used by [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743\u20131819). Jacobi used the term to characterize [[rationalism]]<ref>George di Giovanni, ''Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi'', The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ Stanford.edu]</ref> and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s \"critical\" philosophy to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]] according to which all rationalism (philosophy as criticism) reduces to nihilism\u2014and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]]. Bret W. Davis writes, for example, \"The first philosophical development of the idea of nihilism is generally ascribed to Friedrich Jacobi, who in a famous letter criticized [[Fichte]]'s idealism as falling into nihilism. According to Jacobi, Fichte's absolutization of the ego (the 'absolute I' that posits the 'not-I') is an inflation of subjectivity that denies the absolute transcendence of God.\"<ref>Davis, Bret W. - \"Zen After Zarathustra: The Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism\" ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' Issue 28 (2004):89-138 (here 107).</ref> A related but oppositional concept is [[fideism]], which sees reason as hostile and inferior to faith.\n\nWith the popularizing of the word ''nihilism'' by [[Ivan Turgenev]], a new Russian political movement called the [[Nihilist movement]] adopted the term.

Though the notion appears frequently throughout Nietzsche's work, he uses the term in a variety of ways, with different meanings and connotations. [[Karen L. Carr]] describes Nietzsche's characterization of nihilism \"as a condition of tension, as a disproportion between what we want to value (or need) and how the world appears to operate.\"<ref>Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, p. 25.</ref> When we find out that the world does not possess the objective value or meaning that we want it to have or have long since believed it to have, we find ourselves in a crisis.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:6 [25]</ref> Nietzsche asserts that with the decline of Christianity and the rise of physiological decadence,{{clarify|reason=\"Physiological\" normally refers specifically to living biochemical processes; this seems to rather be \"material (or materialistic) decadence\"|date=December 2015}} nihilism is in fact characteristic of the modern age,<ref name=Michels>Steven Michels, \"Nietzsche, Nihilism, and the Virtue of Nature\", Dogma, 2004, [http://dogma.free.fr/txt/SM-Nietzsche.htm Free.fr]</ref> though he implies that the rise of nihilism is still incomplete and that it has yet to be overcome.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:10 [142]</ref> Though the problem of nihilism becomes especially explicit in Nietzsche's [[Nachlass|notebooks]] (published posthumously), it is mentioned repeatedly in his published works and is closely connected to many of the problems mentioned there.\n\nNietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value. This observation stems in part from Nietzsche's [[perspectivism]], or his notion that \"knowledge\" is always by someone of some thing: it is always bound by perspective, and it is never mere fact.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 13:14 [22]</ref> Rather, there are interpretations through which we understand the world and give it meaning. Interpreting is something we can not go without; in fact, it is something we ''need''. One way of interpreting the world is through morality, as one of the fundamental ways that people make sense of the world, especially in regard to their own thoughts and actions. Nietzsche distinguishes a morality that is strong or healthy, meaning that the person in question is aware that he constructs it himself, from weak morality, where the interpretation is projected on to something external.\n\nNietzsche discusses Christianity, one of the major topics in his work, at length in the context of the problem of nihilism in his notebooks, in a chapter entitled \"European Nihilism\".<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:5 [71]</ref> Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[humanism|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[theodicee|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. However, it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing: in its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution. It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity \"not because we lived too far from it, rather because we lived too close\".<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [200]</ref> As such, the self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism. Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as ''the'' interpretation, Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond [[skepticism]] to a distrust of ''all'' meaning.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [127]</ref><ref>Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'' (1992), pp. 41\u201342.</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Rosen]] identifies Nietzsche's concept of nihilism with a situation of meaninglessness, in which \"everything is permitted.\" According to him, the loss of higher metaphysical values that exist in contrast to the base reality of the world, or merely human ideas, gives rise to the idea that all human ideas are therefore valueless. Rejecting idealism thus results in nihilism, because only similarly transcendent ideals live up to the previous standards that the nihilist still implicitly holds.<ref>[[Stanley Rosen|Rosen, Stanley]]. ''Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]]. 1969. p. xiii.</ref> The inability for Christianity to serve as a source of valuating the world is reflected in Nietzsche's famous [[aphorism]] of the madman in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>F. Nietzsche, ''[[The Gay Science]]'': 125.</ref> The death of God, in particular the statement that \"we killed him\", is similar to the ''self''-dissolution of Christian doctrine: due to the advances of the sciences, which for Nietzsche show that man is the product of [[evolution]], that Earth has no [[geocentrism|special place]] among the stars and that [[history]] is not [[progress (history)|progressive]], the Christian notion of God can no longer serve as a basis for a morality.\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western Buddhism#Buddhism and Western Intellectuals|Western Buddhism]], advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to [[nothing]]ness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This mowing away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears inconsistent: this \"will to nothingness\" is still a form of willing.<ref>F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7.</ref> He describes this as \"an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists:\"\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought ''not'' to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos&nbsp;\u2013 at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]],'' section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}\n\nNietzsche's relation to the problem of nihilism is a complex one. He approaches the problem of nihilism as deeply personal, stating that this predicament of the modern world is a problem that has \"become conscious\" in him.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure.<ref name=\"Michels\"/>\n\nHe states that there is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity's self-dissolution, one that does ''not'' stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness. This alternate, 'active' nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new. This form of nihilism is characterized by Nietzsche as \"a sign of strength,\"<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [35]</ref> a willful destruction of the old values to wipe the slate clean and lay down one's own beliefs and interpretations, contrary to the passive nihilism that resigns itself with the decomposition of the old values. This willful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning, this active nihilism, could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a 'free spirit'<ref>K. Carr, ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, pp. 43\u201350.</ref> or the ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'' from ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives his life as if it were his own work of art. It may be questioned, though, whether \"active nihilism\" is indeed the correct term for this stance, and some question whether Nietzsche takes the problems nihilism poses seriously enough.<ref>J. Doomen, \"Consistent Nihilism\", ''[[Journal of Mind and Behavior]]'' 33 (1/2) (2012): pp. 103\u2013117.</ref>\n\n===Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche===\n[[Martin Heidegger]]'s interpretation of Nietzsche influenced many postmodern thinkers who investigated the problem of nihilism as put forward by Nietzsche. Only recently has Heidegger's influence on Nietzschean nihilism research faded.<ref>\"Heideggers, Aus-einander-setzung' mit Nietzsches hat mannigfache Resonanz gefunden. Das Verh\u00e4ltnis der beiden Philosophen zueinander ist dabei von unterschiedlichen Positionen aus diskutiert worden. Inzwischen ist es nicht mehr ungew\u00f6hnlich, da\u00df Heidegger, entgegen seinem Anspruch auf, Verwindung' der Metaphysik und des ihr zugeh\u00f6rigen Nihilismus, in jenen Nihilismus zur\u00fcckgestellt wird, als dessen Vollender er Nietzsche angesehen hat.\" [[Wolfgang M\u00fcller-Lauter]], ''Heidegger und Nietzsche. Nietzsche-Interpretationen III'', Berlin-New York 2000, p. 303.</ref> As early as the 1930s, Heidegger was giving lectures on Nietzsche's thought.<ref>Cf. both by Heidegger: Vol. I, ''Nietzsche I'' (1936-39). Translated as ''Nietzsche I: The Will to Power as Art'' by David F. Krell (New York: Harper & Row, 1979); Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as \"The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper & Row, 1984).</ref> Given the importance of Nietzsche's contribution to the topic of nihilism, Heidegger's influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important for the historical development of the term ''nihilism''.\n\nHeidegger's method of researching and teaching Nietzsche is explicitly his own. He does not specifically try to present Nietzsche ''as'' Nietzsche. He rather tries to incorporate Nietzsche's thoughts into his own philosophical system of [[Heidegger#Philosophy|Being, Time and ''Dasein'']].<ref>\"Indem Heidegger das von Nietzsche Ungesagte im Hinblick auf die Seinsfrage zur Sprache zu bringen sucht, wird das von Nietzsche Gesagte in ein diesem selber fremdes Licht ger\u00fcckt.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 267.</ref> In his ''Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being'' (1944\u201346),<ref>Original German: ''Die seinsgeschichtliche Bestimmung des Nihilismus''. Found in the second volume of his lectures: Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as \"The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper & Row, 1984).</ref> Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche's nihilism as trying to achieve a victory through the devaluation of the, until then, highest values. The principle of this devaluation is, according to Heidegger, the [[will to power]]. The will to power is also the principle of every earlier ''valuation'' of values.<ref>\n\"Heidegger geht davon aus, da\u00df Nietzsche den Nihilismus als Entwertung der bisherigen obersten Werte versteht; seine \u00dcberwindung soll durch die Umwertung der Werte erfolgen. Das Prinzip der Umwertung wie auch jeder fr\u00fcheren Wertsetzung ist der Wille zur Macht.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.</ref> How does this devaluation occur and why is this nihilistic? One of Heidegger's main critiques on philosophy is that philosophy, and more specifically metaphysics, has forgotten to discriminate between investigating the notion of ''a'' being (''Seiende'') and ''Being'' (''Sein''). According to Heidegger, the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of metaphysics. And because metaphysics has forgotten to ask about the notion of Being (what Heidegger calls ''[[:de:Seinsvergessenheit|Seinsvergessenheit]]''), it is a history about the destruction of Being. That is why Heidegger calls metaphysics nihilistic.<ref>\"What remains unquestioned and forgotten in metaphysics is being; and hence, it is nihilistic.\", [http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/ UTM.edu], visited on November 24, 2009.</ref> This makes Nietzsche's metaphysics not a victory over nihilism, but a perfection of it.<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.</ref>\n\nHeidegger, in his interpretation of Nietzsche, has been inspired by [[Ernst J\u00fcnger]]. Many references to J\u00fcnger can be found in Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche. For example, in a letter to the rector of Freiburg University of November 4, 1945, Heidegger, inspired by J\u00fcnger, tries to explain the notion of \"[[God is dead]]\" as the \"reality of the Will to Power.\" Heidegger also praises J\u00fcnger for defending Nietzsche against a too biological or anthropological reading during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 272-275.</ref>\n\nHeidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche influenced a number of important postmodernist thinkers. [[Gianni Vattimo]] points at a back-and-forth movement in European thought, between Nietzsche and Heidegger. During the 1960s, a Nietzschean 'renaissance' began, culminating in the work of [[Mazzino Montinari]] and [[Giorgio Colli]]. They began work on a new and complete edition of Nietzsche's collected works, making Nietzsche more accessible for scholarly research. Vattimo explains that with this new edition of Colli and Montinari, a critical reception of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape. Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers, Vattimo does not want, or only partially wants, to rely on Heidegger for understanding Nietzsche. On the other hand, Vattimo judges Heidegger's intentions authentic enough to keep pursuing them.<ref>\nM\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 301-303.</ref> Philosophers who Vattimo exemplifies as a part of this back and forth movement are French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]. Italian philosophers of this same movement are [[Massimo Cacciari|Cacciari]], [[Emanuele Severino|Severino]] and himself.<ref>\"Er (Vattimo) konstatiert, in vielen europ\u00e4ischen Philosophien eine Hin- und Herbewegung zwischen Heidegger und Nietzsche\". Dabei denkt er, wie seine sp\u00e4teren Ausf\u00fchrungen zeigen, z.B. an Deleuze, Foucault und Derrida auf franz\u00f6sischer Seite, an Cacciari, Severino und an sich selbst auf italienischer Seite.\", M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 302.</ref> [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and [[Richard Rorty]] are also philosophers who are influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche.<ref>M\u00fcller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 303\u2013304.</ref>\n\n=== Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche ===\n[[Gilles Deleuze]]'s interpretation of Nietzsche's concept of nihilism is different - in some sense diametrically opposed - to the usual definition (as outlined in the rest of this article). Nihilism is one of the main topics of Deleuze's early book ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Philosophy|last=Deleuze|first=Gilles|publisher=The Athlone Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-231-13877-2|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Tomlinson|translator-first=Hugh|orig-year=1962}}</ref> There, Deleuze repeatedly interprets Nietzsche's nihilism as \"the enterprise of denying life and depreciating existence\".<ref>Deleuze, ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p.34.</ref> Nihilism thus defined is therefore not the denial of higher values, or the denial of meaning, but rather the depreciation of life in the name of such higher values or meaning. Deleuze therefore (with, he claims, Nietzsche) says that Christianity and Platonism, and with them the whole of metaphysics, are intrinsically nihilist.\n\n===Postmodernism===\n[[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodern]] and [[poststructuralist]] thought has questioned the very grounds on which [[Western culture]]s have based their 'truths': absolute knowledge and meaning, a 'decentralization' of authorship, the accumulation of positive knowledge, historical progress, and certain ideals and practices of [[humanism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].\n\n==== Derrida ====\n[[Jacques Derrida]], whose [[deconstruction]] is perhaps most commonly labeled nihilistic, did not himself make the nihilistic move that others have claimed. Derridean deconstructionists argue that this approach rather frees texts, individuals or organizations from a restrictive truth, and that deconstruction opens up the possibility of other ways of being.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/specials/derrida/josenihil.htm Borginho, Jose] 1999; Nihilism and Affirmation. Retrieved 05-12-07.</ref> [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], for example, uses deconstruction to create an ethics of opening up Western scholarship to the voice of the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and to philosophies outside of the canon of western texts.<ref>Spivak, Chakravorty Gayatri; 1988; Can The Subaltern Speak?; in Nelson, Cary and Grossberg, Lawrence (eds); 1988; Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture; Macmillan Education, Basingstoke.</ref> Derrida himself built a philosophy based upon a 'responsibility to the other'.<ref>Reynolds, Jack; 2001; [http://www.mic.ul.ie/stephen/derrida.pdf The Other of Derridean Deconstruction: Levinas, Phenomenology and the Question of Responsibility]; Minerva - An Internet Journal of Philosophy 5: 31\u201362. Retrieved 05-12-07.</ref> Deconstruction can thus be seen not as a denial of truth, but as a denial of our ability to know truth. That is to say, it makes an [[epistemological]] claim, compared to nihilism's [[ontological]] claim.\n\n==== Lyotard ====\n[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard|Lyotard]] argues that, rather than relying on an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] truth or method to prove their claims, philosophers legitimize their truths by reference to a story about the world that can't be separated from the age and system the stories belong to\u2014referred to by Lyotard as ''[[Metanarrative|meta-narratives]].'' He then goes on to define the [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]] as characterized by a rejection both of these meta-narratives and of the process of [[legitimation]] by meta-narratives.\n\n<blockquote>In lieu of meta-narratives we have created new [[language-game]]s in order to legitimize our claims which rely on changing relationships and mutable truths, none of which is privileged over the other to speak to ultimate truth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} </blockquote>\n\nThis concept of the instability of truth and meaning leads in the direction of nihilism, though Lyotard stops short of embracing the latter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==== Baudrillard ====\nPostmodern theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] wrote briefly of nihilism from the postmodern viewpoint in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. He stuck mainly to topics of interpretations of the real world over the simulations of which the real world is composed. The uses of meaning were an important subject in Baudrillard's discussion of nihilism:\n\n{{quote|The [[apocalypse]] is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of indifference...all that remains, is the fascination for desertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general situation in an era of involuntary transparency.|Jean Baudrillard, ''Simulacra and Simulation'', \"On Nihilism\", trans. 1995{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}}}\n\n===Transcendentalism or methodological naturalism===\nIn ''Nihil Unbound: Extinction and Enlightenment'', [[Ray Brassier]] maintains that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of [[extinction]], instead attempting to find meaning in a world conditioned by the very idea of its own annihilation. Thus Brassier critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of Continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like [[Gilles Deleuze]], who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the \"threat\" of nihilism. Instead, drawing on thinkers such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle]], [[Paul Churchland]], and [[Thomas Metzinger]], Brassier defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning. That is, rather than avoiding nihilism, Brassier embraces it as the truth of reality. Brassier concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing,<ref>Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 148\u2013149.</ref> but also that philosophy is the \"organon of extinction,\" that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all.<ref>Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 223\u2013226, 234\u2013238.</ref> Brassier then defends a radically anti-correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being, but with Non-Being.\n\n== In culture ==\n===Dada===\nThe term ''[[Dadaism|Dada]]'' was first used by [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] in 1916.<ref>de Micheli, Mario (2006). ''Las vanguardias art\u00edsticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. pp. 135-137.</ref> The movement, which lasted from approximately 1916 to 1923, arose during [[World War I]], an event that influenced the artists.<ref name=\"Tzara\">Tzara, Tristan (December 2005).

Due to perceived ambiguity, it has been classified as a nihilistic ''[[modus vivendi]]''.<ref name=\"Tzara\" />\n\n===Literature===\nThe term \"nihilism\" was actually popularized in 1862 by [[Ivan Turgenev]] in his novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]],'' whose hero, Bazarov, was a nihilist and recruited several followers to the philosophy. He found his nihilistic ways challenged upon falling in love.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism | title = Nihilism | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Martin | date = April 1, 2012| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Anton Chekhov]] portrayed nihilism when writing ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''. The phrase \"what does it matter\" or variants of this are often spoken by several characters in response to events; the significance of some of these events suggests a subscription to nihilism by said characters as a type of coping strategy.\n\nThe philosophical ideas of the French author, the [[Marquis de Sade]], are often noted as early examples of nihilistic principles.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1312938684 | title = Nihilism: Philosophy of Nothingness | publisher = Google Books | date = January 5, 2015| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Absurdism]]\n* [[Acosmism]]\n* [[Agnosticism]]\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anatta]]\n* [[Anti-art]] and [[Anti-anti-art]]\n* [[Anti-humanism]]\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Apatheism]]\n* [[Apathy]]\n* [[Cosmicism]]\n* [[Cynicism (philosophy)]]\n* [[Dao De Jing]]\n* [[Dysteleology]]\n* [[Rational egoism|Egoism]]\n* [[Eliminative materialism]]\n* [[Existentialism]]\n* [[Hedonism]]\n* [[U.

In 2006, the charity took over the work of the AA Motoring Trust, which had been established in 2002 by [[The Automobile Association]]. The charity brought its different activities and programmes together under one umbrella called '''IAM RoadSmart''' in 2016.\n\n==History==\nThe organisation was formed in March 1956.<ref name=Autocar197703>{{cite journal |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume= |editor-first=Ray |editor-last=Hutton |title=IAM 21 |pages=49\u201350 |date=19 March 1977}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, two new assessments were introduced: DriveCheck and RideCheck. These checks provide the opportunity to have your driving or riding ability assessed by an IAM observer. DriveCheck and RideCheck are not, however, a test. There is no pass or fail. The IAM later added DriveCheck55, which offers the opportunity for people over the age of 55 to have driving checked and receive tips from a police Class 1 driver. This has been renamed Mature Driver Review.\n\nAt the end of 2006 the organisation formed the [[IAM Motoring Trust]] and took over the work of the AA Motoring Trust which had been formed by [[The Automobile Association]] in 2002.<ref name=\"The IAM Motoring Trust\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rrtha.org.uk/CM2-IAM%20Trust.htm |title=The IAM Motoring Trust |work=Roads & Road Transport History Association |access-date=29 April 2010 |quote=The IAM Motoring Trust is a new, independent road safety organisation, which forms the research and advocacy arm of the IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) The Trust is taking forward the work of the AA Motoring Trust, which ceased to operate on 31 December 2006. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121221154/http://www.rrtha.org.uk/CM2-IAM%20Trust.htm |archive-date=21 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the IAM published \"How to be a better cyclist\" (the third in the IAM Series, the others being \"How to be a better driver\" and \"How to be a better rider\"). The IAM now offers a special Cycling membership that includes insurance cover.\n\nMarket research suggested the title ''Institute'' did not appeal to younger drivers, so the initials \"IAM\" have been used increasingly.  In 2011, reducing the queue for the advanced test itself has become a priority.\n\nThe IAM also has a commercial subsidiary that provides occupational driver risk management products and services to the UK business community who have a duty of care to employers to ensure they are competent and safe. This business is IAM Drive & Survive.\n\nThe IAM began a modernisation programme in 2015 updating its driving standards and increasing its services. On 4 April 2016, as a result of a rebrand, the charity brought its different activities and programmes together under one umbrella brand called IAM RoadSmart. None of the changes affected its charitable status.\n\n==Structure==\n''The Institute of Advanced Motorists Limited'' was incorporated on 10 March 1956 as a company limited by guarantee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00562530 |title=INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED MOTORISTS LIMITED(THE) |publisher=Companies House, UK Government |date= |access-date=29 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230020720/https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00562530 |archive-date=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> A separate \"Institute of Advanced ''Motorcyclists''\" was registered in 2006, although it rarely or never features in IAM publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05889513 |title=THE INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED MOTORCYCLISTS LIMITED |publisher=Companies House, UK Government |date= |access-date=29 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230020928/https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05889513 |archive-date=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> IAM is privately owned, holding no [[share capital|shares]].

Other ambassadors for the brand include [[Maria Costello]] who is the rider ambassador, [[Catie Munnings]] who is driver ambassador, and David Gallagher who is the young driver ambassador.\n\nKen Kier OBE, former executive vice president of Honda Motor Europe, was elected chairman of the IAM in November 2015, taking over from Alistair Cheyne OBE. Current vice presidents of the IAM include former BBC Crimewatch presenter and safety campaigner Nick Ross and former transport minister [[Peter Bottomley|Sir Peter Bottomley MP]].\n\n==Membership==\nTo become a member, one needs to pass the advanced test. There are exemptions for people with suitable emergency services or military driving qualifications.  Trainees are called ''associates'', and instructors ''observers''.\n\nMembership fees are paid to both head office and the local group.  Full membership is renewable annually at \u00a336 to head office, and many local groups charge around \u00a320 yearly.  Associates pay \u00a3149 once to the Head Office to join, which includes the first attempt at the advanced test.\n\nDespite the name ''Advanced'', only a few months' experience (one year in Northern Ireland, because of speed restrictions on newly qualified drivers) are necessary to become an associate. Many people report the value in joining the IAM early in their driving careers, because it helped them to avoid typical new driver accidents.\n\nThere are four levels of IAM membership, representing increasing skill levels. IAM entry level is considered a foundation in advanced motoring, which is easily achievable by most people. It requires only a rudimentary grasp of the police system of driving. At a higher skill level, a ''F1RST'' is awarded to those who pass their advanced test and achieve a score of 1 in virtually every category.<ref name=\"F1RST\"/> An IAM F1RST is considered to be at least as high as standard as a ''RoSPA Gold''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.advanced-driving.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4170 |title=IAM Masters v RoSPA |work=The Advanced Driving UK Forum |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Moving up to a much higher skill level are ''Masters'' and ''Masters with distinction'' (described below).<ref name=\"Masters\"/> The latter is now recognised as the highest civilian driving qualification in the UK.\n\nThis badge denotes drivers and riders who have passed the advanced test.\n[[File:Iamlogo.png|frame|left|IAM car drivers badge]]\n\n==Notable members==\n* [[Andy Green]], world [[land speed record]] holder\n* [[Maria Costello]], former fastest woman to lap the Isle of Man TT, and the first women to win a podium on the island  \n* [[John Cleland]], twice British Touring Car Champion\n* [[Paddy Hopkirk]], former World Rally Championship winner\n* [[Nigel Mansell]], former World Champion in [[Formula One]]\n\n==Activities==\nThe IAM's objective is to increase road safety by improving driving standards. Many people find their increased skills bring more enjoyment to driving.\n\n==Advanced driving test==\n{{Main|Advanced driving test}}\nThe IAM offers the [[advanced driving test]].  It is run independently, and does not affect the driving licence from the country where the associate lives.  The test is significantly more difficult than the standard driving test, but is within the reach of most drivers with the right guidance.  The techniques are based on the UK [[Roadcraft|police driving manual]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/projects/roadcraft |title=Roadcraft |work=The Police Foundation |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nReasons for attempting the test include improving skills, safety or simply for fun.  Motor insurers normally award a small discount on  premiums (typically 10%), but a greater insurance discount is usually found with [https://www.cornmarketinsurance.co.uk/group-insurance/insurance-for-iam-surety/ the IAM's associated insurance company] (IAM Surety).  It may also appeal because the associate can improve their skill as an individual, avoiding default assumptions of risk based on statistics.\n\nIt is marketed under the name ''Skills for Life'' to emphasise the purpose of preventing fatalities and enhanced skills.\n\nResearch has shown advanced drivers to be safer and have better fuel efficiency too.  For example, a study by [[Brunel University]] found advanced drivers who had been through the IAM system of car control were nearly 70% better in all aspects of their driving \u2013 from steering to judging distances and speed.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=N.

In short, IAM members are safer drivers.<ref name=\"Hoinville\"/>\n\n400,000 people have attempted the advanced test, and the pass rate is around 75%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/motorists-courses/advanced-driving/motorists-skill-for-life |title=Skill for Life |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\nBefore attempting the test, associates complete a training programme with volunteers called \"observers\" provided by the local group, and arranged at mutually convenient times.  IAM suggest six lessons may be enough to pass,<ref name=\"iam.org.uk\"/> but time taken varies and there is no maximum.  Associates use a textbook called ''How to be a Better Driver'', which is a simplified version of the police driving manual ''Roadcraft''. ''How to be a Better Driver'' has been criticised by some for being over simplified.\n\nObservers are not paid for their time, although motorcycle associates may reimburse their observers for fuel. (In motorcycling, the associate and observer ride their own bikes.)  Observers are trained internally, but accredited though an external body.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/component/content/article?id=20218 |title=IMI Procedural guidance |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Variable quality of observers was a criticism of the IAM, which it started to address in 2013-14 by strengthening observer training and using IMI to externally accredit observers. Some observers are professional instructors or hold the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|RoSPA]] Diploma in Advanced Instruction.  There are some more senior instructors, called National Observers, in each group.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/iam-groups/imi |title=IMI National Observer qualification documents |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs with any road situation, legality and paperwork (including [[driving licence|licence]], [[vehicle insurance|insurance]], and [[vehicle inspection]]) is the driver's responsibility.  In particular, motorcycle observers are advised to check they are insured for that purpose, since they ride their own bike.\n\n===Test procedure===\nUnlike [[United Kingdom driving test|the standard driving test]] administered by the [[DVSA]], the IAM advanced test has less pressure, because pass or fail makes no difference to the driver's licence. Rather, the IAM \"test\" provides the opportunity to gain assessment, guidance and tips from a police pursuit driver.\n\nThe test lasts for approximately 90 minutes and covers about {{convert|30|to|40|mi}} and includes [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] areas; and [[motorway]]s and/or [[dual carriageway]]s, to test the candidate in a wide range of conditions and hazards. The examiner is a serving or retired [[Constable|police officer]] who holds a Police Advanced Driving Certificate (or holds the Police Driving Instructor Certificate from the UK Home Office).\n\nTests are marked simply as a fail, pass or F1RST,<ref name=\"F1RST\">{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/f1rst |title=F1RST |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> and can be retaken as often as desired. It is not unusual for those who have passed to retake the test to aim for a F1RST. Once the test is passed, the candidate is an advanced driver for life \u2013 unlike RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders (RoADAR), which require a 3-yearly re-test.<ref name=\"Roadar\">{{cite web |url= http://www.roadar.org.uk/drivers/the-test.htm |title=Advanced Driving Test |work=RoADAR |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> An IAM advanced driver is not subject to re-testing, even if their [[driving licence|licence]] is suspended by the government, but relevant motoring convictions must be disclosed on annual renewal of membership.\n\n==Other services==\nIn 2014, the IAM introduced ''Masters'' as an even higher standard of driving.<ref name=\"Masters\">{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/motorists-courses/masters |title=Masters |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Masters is a big step up from IAM entry level. The IAM Masters programme provides true \"one to one\" mentoring support and guidance, in order to help people achieve the highest level of civilian driving standard in the country.

However, IAM Masters is now widely recognised as the highest civilian qualification in the UK.

These checks provide the opportunity to have your driving or riding ability assessed by an IAM observer. DriveCheck and RideCheck are not, however, a test. There is no pass or fail. The IAM later added DriveCheck55, which offers the opportunity for people over the age of 55 to have driving checked and receive tips from a police Class 1 driver. This has been renamed Mature Driver Review.\n\nAt the end of 2006 the organisation formed the [[IAM Motoring Trust]] and took over the work of the AA Motoring Trust which had been formed by [[The Automobile Association]] in 2002.<ref name=\"The IAM Motoring Trust\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rrtha.org.uk/CM2-IAM%20Trust.htm |title=The IAM Motoring Trust |work=Roads & Road Transport History Association |access-date=29 April 2010 |quote=The IAM Motoring Trust is a new, independent road safety organisation, which forms the research and advocacy arm of the IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) The Trust is taking forward the work of the AA Motoring Trust, which ceased to operate on 31 December 2006. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121221154/http://www.rrtha.org.uk/CM2-IAM%20Trust.htm |archive-date=21 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the IAM published \"How to be a better cyclist\" (the third in the IAM Series, the others being \"How to be a better driver\" and \"How to be a better rider\"). The IAM now offers a special Cycling membership that includes insurance cover.\n\nMarket research suggested the title ''Institute'' did not appeal to younger drivers, so the initials \"IAM\" have been used increasingly.  In 2011, reducing the queue for the advanced test itself has become a priority.\n\nThe IAM also has a commercial subsidiary that provides occupational driver risk management products and services to the UK business community who have a duty of care to employers to ensure they are competent and safe. This business is IAM Drive & Survive.\n\nThe IAM began a modernisation programme in 2015 updating its driving standards and increasing its services. On 4 April 2016, as a result of a rebrand, the charity brought its different activities and programmes together under one umbrella brand called IAM RoadSmart.

There are exemptions for people with suitable emergency services or military driving qualifications.  Trainees are called ''associates'', and instructors ''observers''.\n\nMembership fees are paid to both head office and the local group.  Full membership is renewable annually at \u00a336 to head office, and many local groups charge around \u00a320 yearly.  Associates pay \u00a3149 once to the Head Office to join, which includes the first attempt at the advanced test.\n\nDespite the name ''Advanced'', only a few months' experience (one year in Northern Ireland, because of speed restrictions on newly qualified drivers) are necessary to become an associate. Many people report the value in joining the IAM early in their driving careers, because it helped them to avoid typical new driver accidents.\n\nThere are four levels of IAM membership, representing increasing skill levels. IAM entry level is considered a foundation in advanced motoring, which is easily achievable by most people. It requires only a rudimentary grasp of the police system of driving. At a higher skill level, a ''F1RST'' is awarded to those who pass their advanced test and achieve a score of 1 in virtually every category.<ref name=\"F1RST\"/> An IAM F1RST is considered to be at least as high as standard as a ''RoSPA Gold''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.advanced-driving.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4170 |title=IAM Masters v RoSPA |work=The Advanced Driving UK Forum |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Moving up to a much higher skill level are ''Masters'' and ''Masters with distinction'' (described below).<ref name=\"Masters\"/> The latter is now recognised as the highest civilian driving qualification in the UK.\n\nThis badge denotes drivers and riders who have passed the advanced test.\n[[File:Iamlogo.png|frame|left|IAM car drivers badge]]\n\n==Notable members==\n* [[Andy Green]], world land speed record holder\n* [[Maria Costello]], former fastest woman to lap the Isle of Man TT, and the first women to win a podium on the island  \n* [[John Cleland]], twice British Touring Car Champion\n* [[Paddy Hopkirk]], former World Rally Championship winner\n* [[Nigel Mansell]], former World Champion in [[Formula One]]\n\n==Activities==\nThe IAM's objective is to increase road safety by improving driving standards. Many people find their increased skills bring more enjoyment to driving.\n\n==Advanced driving test==\n{{Main|Advanced driving test}}\nThe IAM offers the [[advanced driving test]].  It is run independently, and does not affect the driving licence from the country where the associate lives.  The test is significantly more difficult than the standard driving test, but is within the reach of most drivers with the right guidance.  The techniques are based on the UK [[Roadcraft|police driving manual]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/projects/roadcraft |title=Roadcraft |work=The Police Foundation |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nReasons for attempting the test include improving skills, safety or simply for fun.  Motor insurers normally award a small discount on  premiums (typically 10%), but a greater insurance discount is usually found with [https://www.cornmarketinsurance.co.uk/group-insurance/insurance-for-iam-surety/ the IAM's associated insurance company] (IAM Surety).  It may also appeal because the associate can improve their skill as an individual, avoiding default assumptions of risk based on statistics.\n\nIt is marketed under the name ''Skills for Life'' to emphasise the purpose of preventing fatalities and enhanced skills.\n\nResearch has shown advanced drivers to be safer and have better fuel efficiency too.  For example, a study by [[Brunel University]] found advanced drivers who had been through the IAM system of car control were nearly 70% better in all aspects of their driving \u2013 from steering to judging distances and speed.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=N.

In short, IAM members are safer drivers.<ref name=\"Hoinville\"/>\n\n400,000 people have attempted the advanced test, and the pass rate is around 75%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/motorists-courses/advanced-driving/motorists-skill-for-life |title=Skill for Life |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\nBefore attempting the test, associates complete a training programme with volunteers called \"observers\" provided by the local group, and arranged at mutually convenient times.  IAM suggest six lessons may be enough to pass,<ref name=\"iam.org.uk\"/> but time taken varies and there is no maximum.  Associates use a textbook called ''How to be a Better Driver'', which is a simplified version of the police driving manual ''Roadcraft''. ''How to be a Better Driver'' has been criticised by some for being over simplified.\n\nObservers are not paid for their time, although motorcycle associates may reimburse their observers for fuel. (In motorcycling, the associate and observer ride their own bikes.)  Observers are trained internally, but accredited though an external body.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/component/content/article?id=20218 |title=IMI Procedural guidance |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Variable quality of observers was a criticism of the IAM, which it started to address in 2013-14 by strengthening observer training and using IMI to externally accredit observers. Some observers are professional instructors or hold the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|RoSPA]] Diploma in Advanced Instruction.  There are some more senior instructors, called National Observers, in each group.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/iam-groups/imi |title=IMI National Observer qualification documents |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs with any road situation, legality and paperwork (including [[driving licence|licence]], [[vehicle insurance|insurance]], and [[vehicle inspection]]) is the driver's responsibility.  In particular, motorcycle observers are advised to check they are insured for that purpose, since they ride their own bike.\n\n===Test procedure===\nUnlike [[United Kingdom driving test|the standard driving test]] administered by the [[DVSA]], the IAM advanced test has less pressure, because pass or fail makes no difference to the driver's licence. Rather, the IAM \"test\" provides the opportunity to gain assessment, guidance and tips from a police pursuit driver.\n\nThe test lasts for approximately 90 minutes and covers about {{convert|30|to|40|mi}} and includes [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] areas; and [[motorway]]s and/or [[dual carriageway]]s, to test the candidate in a wide range of conditions and hazards. The examiner is a serving or retired [[Constable|police officer]] who holds a Police Advanced Driving Certificate (or holds the Police Driving Instructor Certificate from the UK Home Office).\n\nTests are marked simply as a fail, pass or F1RST,<ref name=\"F1RST\">{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/f1rst |title=F1RST |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> and can be retaken as often as desired. It is not unusual for those who have passed to retake the test to aim for a F1RST. Once the test is passed, the candidate is an advanced driver for life \u2013 unlike RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders (RoADAR), which require a 3-yearly re-test.<ref name=\"Roadar\">{{cite web |url= http://www.roadar.org.uk/drivers/the-test.htm |title=Advanced Driving Test |work=RoADAR |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> An IAM advanced driver is not subject to re-testing, even if their [[driving licence|licence]] is suspended by the government, but relevant motoring convictions must be disclosed on annual renewal of membership.\n\n==Other services==\nIn 2014, the IAM introduced ''Masters'' as an even higher standard of driving.<ref name=\"Masters\">{{cite web |url= http://www.iam.org.uk/drivers/motorists-courses/masters |title=Masters |work=The Institute of Advanced Motorists |year=2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Masters is a big step up from IAM entry level.

It is the third installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]]. [[Harrison Ford]] reprises [[Indiana Jones|the title role]], while [[Henry Jones, Sr.|his father]] is portrayed by [[Sean Connery]]. Other cast members featured include [[Alison Doody]], [[Denholm Elliott]], [[Julian Glover]], [[River Phoenix]], and [[John Rhys-Davies]]. In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a [[Holy Grail]] scholar, who has been kidnapped by [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].\n\nAfter the mixed reaction to ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', Spielberg chose to tone down the gore in the next installment. During the five years between ''The Temple of Doom'' and ''The Last Crusade'', he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting [[Jeffrey Boam]]'s. Filming locations included [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Jordan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67198 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' |accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in North America on May 24, 1989 to mostly positive reviews and a financial success, earning $474.2 million at the worldwide box office totals. It won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, thirteen-year-old [[Indiana Jones|Henry \"Indiana\" Jones, Jr]] is horseback riding with his [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] troop at [[Arches National Park]] in [[Utah]]. While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden [[crucifix]] belonging to [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado|Coronado]] and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing [[circus train]], leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a [[bullwhip]] and a new [[Ophidiophobia|phobia of snakes]]. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a [[Panama Hat]]. Impressed with Indy's bravery, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Garth|the leader of the robbers]] gives Indy his [[fedora]] to  encourage him to not give up.\n\nIn 1938, Indy battles \"[[List of Indiana Jones characters#Panama Hat|Panama Hat]]\" and his henchmen on a ship off the storm-blasted coast of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], and escaping overboard just before the ship explodes, he recovers the cross and donates it to [[Marcus Brody]]'s museum. Later, Indy is introduced to [[Walter Donovan]], who informs him that his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], has vanished while searching for the [[Holy Grail]], using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide. Indy receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and heads there with Marcus, where they meet Henry's [[Federal State of Austria|Austrian]] colleague Dr. [[Elsa Schneider]]. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a [[First Crusade]] knight, which contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the [[petroleum]]-saturated waters of the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a [[secret society]] that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Kazim|Kazim]], who tells Indy where Henry is being held after Indy explains that his only goal is to find Henry, not the Grail. Marcus reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to [[\u0130skenderun]], the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend [[Sallah]].\n\nIndy and Elsa head to a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled castle in Austria where Henry is being held. Indy finds Henry, but learns that both Elsa and Donovan are actually working with the Nazis and are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Marcus is captured in [[Hatay State|Hatay]] while meeting with Sallah. After escaping from the castle, Henry tells Indy that the Grail is guarded by three [[booby trap]]s and his diary contains the clues needed to pass them safely. Indy recovers the diary from Elsa at a [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] rally in [[Berlin]], briefly coming face-to-face with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. They board a [[Zeppelin]] to leave Germany, but the Nazis discover the Joneses are aboard. The Joneses escape in a [[Parasite aircraft|parasite]] [[biplane]], and crash while engaging in a [[dogfight]] with [[Luftwaffe]] fighters.\n\nThe two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus' abduction. The Nazis have been equipped by the [[Sultan]] of Hatay and are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by SS Colonel [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Vogel|Ernst Vogel]] while attempting to rescue Marcus from a tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death.\n\nIndy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to get past the three protective traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save his father. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Grail Knight|a knight]]. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail grants eternal life, while a false one will kill the drinker. Elsa selects a golden chalice studded with emeralds for Donovan, who rapidly ages into dust after drinking from it, proving it to be false. Indy picks a simple wooden cup,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones |last1=Magnoli |first1=Anthony |last2=Wiseart |first2=Kristen |last3=Price |first3=Joanna |year=2008 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-6315-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/lostjournalofind0000rinz}}</ref> and the knight tells him that he has \"chosen wisely,\" proving it to be the right one but warns that the Holy Grail cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance, in accordance with the Law of God.\n\nIndy fills the Grail with [[holy water]] and gives it to Henry, healing him instantly. Elsa disregards the knight's warning and tries to take the Grail with her, causing the temple to collapse around them. When the Grail falls into a chasm in the floor, Elsa plummets to her death trying to recover it, due to her being unable to let go of her obsession with it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry urges him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of characters in the Indiana Jones series}}\n\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: The archaeologist adventurer who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?\"<ref name=hattrick/>\n** [[River Phoenix]] as a younger Indiana Jones.

Ford recommended Phoenix for the part; he said that of the young actors working at the time, Phoenix looked the most like him when he was around that age.<ref name=making/>\n* [[Denholm Elliott]] as Marcus Brody: Indiana's bumbling English colleague. Elliott returned after Spielberg sought to recapture the tone of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), following the actor's absence in the darker ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|Temple of Doom]]'' (1984).<ref name=making/>\n* [[Alison Doody]] as [[Dr. Elsa Schneider|Elsa Schneider]]: An Austrian art professor who is in league with the Nazis. She seduces the Joneses to trick them.

Like Elliott's, Rhys-Davies' return was an attempt to recapture the spirit of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.<ref name=making/>\n* [[Julian Glover]] as Walter Donovan: An American businessman who sends the Joneses on their quest for the Holy Grail out of a desire for [[immortality]] while secretly working with the Nazis for the same goal. Glover previously appeared as [[List of Star Wars characters#V|General Veers]] in Lucas' ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. He originally auditioned for the role of Vogel.

In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-page treatment titled ''Indiana Jones and the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]'', which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the [[Fountain of Youth]] in Africa.<ref name=monkeyking>Rinzler, Bouzereau, \"The Monkey King: July 1984 to May 1988\", p. 184 - 203.</ref>\n\n[[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]\u2014who had written the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'', ''[[The Goonies]]'', and ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]''\u2014was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a [[Peaches of Immortality|Garden of Immortal Peaches]]. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to [[Mozambique]] to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a [[Katharine Hepburn]]-type according to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old [[pygmies|pygmy]]. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier\u2014an old friend of Indiana\u2014travel up the [[Zambezi]] river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a [[Toshiro Mifune]]-type), who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart.<ref name=monkeyking/>\n\nColumbus' second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash\u2014an [[expatriate]] bar owner for whom the Nazis work\u2014and the Monkey King as villains.

Meyjes completed his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his father in [[Monts\u00e9gur]], where he meets a nun named Chantal. Indiana travels to [[Venice]], takes the ''[[Orient Express]]'' to [[Istanbul]], and continues by train to [[Petra]], where he meets [[Sallah]] and reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to [[Heaven]]. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in [[Krak des Chevaliers]], the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with \"God is King\".

Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film.<ref name=monkeyking/> Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story. \"Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended,\" he said, \"So I thought, let them ''lose'' the Grail, and let the father\u2013son relationship be the main point.

The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail.<ref name=monkeyking/>\n\nBoam's February 23, 1988 rewrite utilized many of Connery's comic suggestions.

The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.<ref name=familybonds/>\n[[Image:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Al Khazneh]] (The Treasury) at Petra, Jordan was used for the entrance to the temple housing the Holy Grail.]]\nCostume designer [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] found it a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but did not want to hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.<ref name=pro/>\nThe motorcycles used in the chase from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with sidecar in which Indy and Henry escape was an original [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]], complete with machine gun [[Pintle mount#Pintle|pintle]] on the sidecar, while the pursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and logos to make them resemble German army models.\nGibbs used Swiss [[Pilatus P-2]] army training planes standing in for [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s.

A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan was used for the shot of the biplane detaching. [[Stop motion]] animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]]; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later [[compositing|composited]] into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred [[tim-bird]]s were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls.<ref name=completion/> ILM's [[Wes Takahashi]] supervised the film's effects sequences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html |title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi |publisher=Animators' Hall of Fame|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Leapoffaith.jpg|thumb|left|Indiana discovers a bridge hidden by [[camouflage]]. Ford was filmed in front of a bluescreen for the scene, which was completed by a model of the bridge filmed against a matte painting]]\nSpielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail.<ref name=hattrick/> For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells \"[[Jehovah|Iehova]]\" on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on \"J\". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by [[forced perspective]], was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.<ref name=completion/>\n\nSpielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to [[Julian Glover]]'s forehead and cheeks by [[Nick Dudman]] that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by [[morphing]] together three puppets of Donovan created by [[Stephan Dupuis]] in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).<ref name=viewingguide/> A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because [[Alison Doody]]'s double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces [[Texture mapping|mapped]] over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a [[marionette]]; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.<ref name=completion/>\n\n[[Ben Burtt]] designed the sound effects. He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats,<ref name=pro/> and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a [[wind turbine]] for the plane crashes.<ref name=completion/> Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a [[.357 Magnum]] in [[Skywalker Ranch]]'s underground car park, just as Lucas drove in.<ref name=pro/> A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple.<ref>(2003). ''The Sound of Indiana Jones'' (DVD).

Rain was created by filming granulated [[Borax]] soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly [[Multiple exposure#Double exposure|double exposed]] into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], which already had appropriate [[art deco]] architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating \"Berlin Flughafen\". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of [[fill light]] in the shadows and [[Backlighting (lighting design)|rim light]] on the edges of the buildings.<ref name=completion/>\n\n==Themes==\nA son's relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg's films, including ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''.<ref name=faber/> <!-- Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode notes that apart from Henry, Indiana has two other father figures, [[Marcus Brody]], and the grave robber known as Fedora. Henry seeks spiritual \"illumination\" while searching for the Holy Grail. In the prologue, Henry's face is not shown on screen, symbolizing that his relationship with his son has disappeared on an emotional level. Fedora is a mercenary and a villain but he is friendly towards Indiana. Both men inspired Indiana's dual personality as an adult: on the one hand, Indiana honors his father by teaching archaeology, but this is a social rather than spiritual way of examining artifacts, and further rejects Henry by dressing and adventuring like Fedora, the exciting father Indiana wished he had. Brody is far less self-important than Henry, and had he been Indiana's father then there would have been no need for him to invent the rebellious persona of the hatted explorer.-->\n\nThe film's exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' and ''[[Field of Dreams]]''. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected [[New Age]] concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana nor his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their [[Boy's Own Paper|boys' own]] adventure. James contrasted the temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's mother does not appear in the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film's events began.<ref>{{cite news |author=Caryn James |title=It's a New Age For Father\u2013Son Relationships |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1989 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE143AF93AA35754C0A96F948260 |accessdate=February 18, 2009}}</ref>\n<!-- http://toddalcott.livejournal.com/193323.html http://toddalcott.livejournal.com/193572.html-->\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing===\n{{See also|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's [[teaser trailer]] debuted in November 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|The Naked Gun]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Aljean Harmetz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/18/movies/makers-of-jones-sequel-offer-teasers-and-tidbits.html |title=Makers of 'Jones' Sequel Offer Teasers and Tidbits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 18, 1989 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> Rob MacGregor wrote the [[tie-in]] novelization that was released in June 1989;<ref>{{cite book |author=Rob MacGregor |title=Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |date=September 1989 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345361615 |isbn=978-0-345-36161-5}}</ref> it sold enough copies to be included on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Paperback Best Sellers: June 11, 1989 |date=June 11, 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> MacGregor went on to write the first six [[Indiana Jones (franchise)#Adult novels|''Indiana Jones'' prequel novels]] during the 1990s.

Spielberg]], from a story co-written by executive producer [[George Lucas]]. It is the third installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]]. [[Harrison Ford]] reprises [[Indiana Jones|the title role]], while [[Henry Jones, Sr.|his father]] is portrayed by [[Sean Connery]]. Other cast members featured include [[Alison Doody]], [[Denholm Elliott]], [[Julian Glover]], [[River Phoenix]], and [[John Rhys-Davies]]. In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a [[Holy Grail]] scholar, who has been kidnapped by [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].\n\nAfter the mixed reaction to ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', Spielberg chose to tone down the gore in the next installment. During the five years between ''The Temple of Doom'' and ''The Last Crusade'', he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting [[Jeffrey Boam]]'s. Filming locations included [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Jordan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67198 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' |accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in North America on May 24, 1989 to mostly positive reviews and a financial success, earning $474.2 million at the worldwide box office totals. It won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, thirteen-year-old [[Indiana Jones|Henry \"Indiana\" Jones, Jr]] is horseback riding with his [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] troop at [[Arches National Park]] in [[Utah]]. While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden [[crucifix]] belonging to [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado|Coronado]] and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing [[circus train]], leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a [[bullwhip]] and a new [[Ophidiophobia|phobia of snakes]]. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a [[Panama Hat]]. Impressed with Indy's bravery, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Garth|the leader of the robbers]] gives Indy his [[fedora]] to  encourage him to not give up.\n\nIn 1938, Indy battles \"[[List of Indiana Jones characters#Panama Hat|Panama Hat]]\" and his henchmen on a ship off the storm-blasted coast of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], and escaping overboard just before the ship explodes, he recovers the cross and donates it to [[Marcus Brody]]'s museum. Later, Indy is introduced to [[Walter Donovan]], who informs him that his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], has vanished while searching for the [[Holy Grail]], using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide. Indy receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from [[Venice]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and heads there with Marcus, where they meet Henry's [[Federal State of Austria|Austrian]] colleague Dr. [[Elsa Schneider]]. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a [[First Crusade]] knight, which contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the [[petroleum]]-saturated waters of the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a [[secret society]] that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Kazim|Kazim]], who tells Indy where Henry is being held after Indy explains that his only goal is to find Henry, not the Grail. Marcus reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to [[\u0130skenderun]], the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend [[Sallah]].\n\nIndy and Elsa head to a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled castle in Austria where Henry is being held. Indy finds Henry, but learns that both Elsa and Donovan are actually working with the Nazis and are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Marcus is captured in [[Hatay State|Hatay]] while meeting with Sallah. After escaping from the castle, Henry tells Indy that the Grail is guarded by three [[booby trap]]s and his diary contains the clues needed to pass them safely. Indy recovers the diary from Elsa at a [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] rally in [[Berlin]], briefly coming face-to-face with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. They board a [[Zeppelin]] to leave Germany, but the Nazis discover the Joneses are aboard. The Joneses escape in a [[Parasite aircraft|parasite]] [[biplane]], and crash while engaging in a [[dogfight]] with [[Luftwaffe]] fighters.\n\nThe two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus' abduction. The Nazis have been equipped by the [[Sultan]] of Hatay and are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by SS Colonel [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Vogel|Ernst Vogel]] while attempting to rescue Marcus from a tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death.\n\nIndy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to get past the three protective traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save his father. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Grail Knight|a knight]]. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail grants eternal life, while a false one will kill the drinker. Elsa selects a golden chalice studded with emeralds for Donovan, who rapidly ages into dust after drinking from it, proving it to be false. Indy picks a simple wooden cup,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones |last1=Magnoli |first1=Anthony |last2=Wiseart |first2=Kristen |last3=Price |first3=Joanna |year=2008 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-6315-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/lostjournalofind0000rinz}}</ref> and the knight tells him that he has \"chosen wisely,\" proving it to be the right one but warns that the Holy Grail cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance, in accordance with the Law of God.\n\nIndy fills the Grail with [[holy water]] and gives it to Henry, healing him instantly. Elsa disregards the knight's warning and tries to take the Grail with her, causing the temple to collapse around them. When the Grail falls into a chasm in the floor, Elsa plummets to her death trying to recover it, due to her being unable to let go of her obsession with it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry urges him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of characters in the Indiana Jones series}}\n\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: The archaeologist adventurer who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other.

Spielberg had Connery in mind when he suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as \"a crazy, eccentric\" professor resembling [[Laurence Olivier]], whose relationship with Indiana is \"strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son\".<ref name=monkeyking/> Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] and felt that no one else could perform the role as well.<ref name=time/> Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] wrote, \"Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]].\"<ref name=faber>McBride, \"An Awfully Big Adventure\", p. 379 \u2013 413</ref> Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented.

In the same scene, [[Ronald Lacey]], who played [[Arnold Toht|Toht]] in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', cameos as [[Heinrich Himmler]]. [[Alexei Sayle]] played the sultan of Hatay. [[Paul Maxwell]] portrayed \"the man with the Panama Hat\" who took possession of the Cross of Coronado.

In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-page treatment titled ''Indiana Jones and the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]'', which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the [[Fountain of Youth]] in Africa.<ref name=monkeyking>Rinzler, Bouzereau, \"The Monkey King: July 1984 to May 1988\", p. 184 - 203.</ref>\n\n[[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]\u2014who had written the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'', ''[[The Goonies]]'', and ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]''\u2014was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a [[Peaches of Immortality|Garden of Immortal Peaches]]. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to [[Mozambique]] to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a [[Katharine Hepburn]]-type according to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old [[pygmies|pygmy]]. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier\u2014an old friend of Indiana\u2014travel up the [[Zambezi]] river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a [[Toshiro Mifune]]-type), who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart.<ref name=monkeyking/>\n\nColumbus' second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash\u2014an [[expatriate]] bar owner for whom the Nazis work\u2014and the Monkey King as villains.

Meyjes completed his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his father in [[Monts\u00e9gur]], where he meets a nun named Chantal. Indiana travels to [[Venice]], takes the ''[[Orient Express]]'' to [[Istanbul]], and continues by train to [[Petra]], where he meets [[Sallah]] and reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to [[Heaven]]. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in [[Krak des Chevaliers]], the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with \"God is King\".

Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film.<ref name=monkeyking/> Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story. \"Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended,\" he said, \"So I thought, let them ''lose'' the Grail, and let the father\u2013son relationship be the main point. It's an archaeological search for Indy's own identity and coming to accept his father is more what it's about [than the quest for the Grail].\"<ref name=faber/> Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films.<ref name=hattrick/> In Boam's first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail.<ref name=monkeyking/>\n\nBoam's February 23, 1988 rewrite utilized many of Connery's comic suggestions. It included the prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas had to convince Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to ''Empire of the Sun'', which was about a young boy.<ref name=hattrick/> Spielberg\u2014who was later awarded the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]]\u2014had the idea of making Indiana a [[Scouts BSA (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]].<ref name=Pre>{{cite news |author=Susan Royal |title=''Always'': An Interview with Steven Spielberg |work=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |pages=45\u201356 |date=December 1989}}</ref> The 1912 prologue as seen in the film refers to events in the lives of Indiana's creators.

[[Leni Riefenstahl]] appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail.

The giraffes were also created in London.

The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]]; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later [[compositing|composited]] into the shot.

Ford was filmed in front of a bluescreen for the scene, which was completed by a model of the bridge filmed against a matte painting]]\nSpielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail.<ref name=hattrick/> For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells \"[[Jehovah|Iehova]]\" on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on \"J\". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by [[forced perspective]], was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.<ref name=completion/>\n\nSpielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to [[Julian Glover]]'s forehead and cheeks by [[Nick Dudman]] that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by [[morphing]] together three puppets of Donovan created by [[Stephan Dupuis]] in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).<ref name=viewingguide/> A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because [[Alison Doody]]'s double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces [[Texture mapping|mapped]] over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a [[marionette]]; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.<ref name=completion/>\n\n[[Ben Burtt]] designed the sound effects. He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats,<ref name=pro/> and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a [[wind turbine]] for the plane crashes.<ref name=completion/> Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a [[.357 Magnum]] in [[Skywalker Ranch]]'s underground car park, just as Lucas drove in.<ref name=pro/> A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple.<ref>(2003). ''The Sound of Indiana Jones'' (DVD). [[Paramount Pictures]].</ref> The film was released in selected theaters in the 70&nbsp;mm Full-Field Sound format, which allowed sounds to not only move from side to side, but also from the theater's [[Quadraphonic sound|front to its rear]].<ref name=completion/>\n\n[[Image:Administration Building, Treasure Island (San Francisco).jpg|thumb|[[Administration Building, Treasure Island|Administration Building]], on [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], served as the \"Berlin Airport\"]]\n[[Matte painting]]s of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated [[Borax]] soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly [[Multiple exposure#Double exposure|double exposed]] into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], which already had appropriate [[art deco]] architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating \"Berlin Flughafen\". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of [[fill light]] in the shadows and [[Backlighting (lighting design)|rim light]] on the edges of the buildings.<ref name=completion/>\n\n==Themes==\nA son's relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg's films, including ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''.<ref name=faber/> <!-- Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode notes that apart from Henry, Indiana has two other father figures, [[Marcus Brody]], and the grave robber known as Fedora. Henry seeks spiritual \"illumination\" while searching for the Holy Grail. In the prologue, Henry's face is not shown on screen, symbolizing that his relationship with his son has disappeared on an emotional level. Fedora is a mercenary and a villain but he is friendly towards Indiana. Both men inspired Indiana's dual personality as an adult: on the one hand, Indiana honors his father by teaching archaeology, but this is a social rather than spiritual way of examining artifacts, and further rejects Henry by dressing and adventuring like Fedora, the exciting father Indiana wished he had. Brody is far less self-important than Henry, and had he been Indiana's father then there would have been no need for him to invent the rebellious persona of the hatted explorer.-->\n\nThe film's exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' and ''[[Field of Dreams]]''. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected [[New Age]] concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana nor his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their [[Boy's Own Paper|boys' own]] adventure. James contrasted the temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's mother does not appear in the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film's events began.<ref>{{cite news |author=Caryn James |title=It's a New Age For Father\u2013Son Relationships |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1989 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE143AF93AA35754C0A96F948260 |accessdate=February 18, 2009}}</ref>\n<!-- http://toddalcott.livejournal.com/193323.html http://toddalcott.livejournal.com/193572.html-->\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing===\n{{See also|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's [[teaser trailer]] debuted in November 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|The Naked Gun]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Aljean Harmetz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/18/movies/makers-of-jones-sequel-offer-teasers-and-tidbits.html |title=Makers of 'Jones' Sequel Offer Teasers and Tidbits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 18, 1989 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> Rob MacGregor wrote the [[tie-in]] novelization that was released in June 1989;<ref>{{cite book |author=Rob MacGregor |title=Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |date=September 1989 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345361615 |isbn=978-0-345-36161-5}}</ref> it sold enough copies to be included on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Paperback Best Sellers: June 11, 1989 |date=June 11, 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> MacGregor went on to write the first six [[Indiana Jones (franchise)#Adult novels|''Indiana Jones'' prequel novels]] during the 1990s.
