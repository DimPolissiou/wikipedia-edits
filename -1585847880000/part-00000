Since at least 1894, philosophers and psychologists attempted to empirically evaluate the morality of an individual, especially attempting to distinguish adults from children in terms of their judgment, but these efforts failed because they \"attempted to quantify how much morality an individual had\u2014a notably contentious idea\u2014rather than understand the individual's psychological representation of morality\".<ref name=\"Wendorf2001\">{{cite journal|last=Wendorf|first=Craig A|year=2001|title=History of American morality research, 1894\u20131932|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247411256|journal=History of Psychology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=272\u2013288|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.4.3.272|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn most introductory psychology courses, students learn about moral psychology by studying the psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]],<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|title=The development of modes of moral thinking and choice in the years 10 to 16.|date=1958|degree=PhD|location=Chicago|oclc=1165315}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=The Measurement of Moral Judgment|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Kohlberg|first2=Lawrence|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32565-3|series=Standard Issue Scoring Manual|volume=2|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofsocial0000gosl|chapter-url-access=registration|last=Kohlberg|first=L.|date=1969|publisher=Rand McNally|editor-last=Goslin|editor-first=David|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofsocial0000gosl/page/347 347\u2013480]|chapter=Stage and sequence: The cognitive development approach to socialization}}</ref> who proposed a highly influential [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|theory of moral development]], developed throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

Moral cognitive development centered around justice and guided moral action increase with development, resulting in a postconventional thinker that can \"do no other\" than what is reasoned to be the most moral action. But researchers using the Kohlberg model found a gap between what people said was most moral and actions they took. Today, some psychologists and students{{Where|date=February 2018}} alike rely on Augusto Blasi's self-model{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that link ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment.

The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices.

He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Lawerence Kohlberg]] sought to expand Piaget's work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.</ref> suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G.

J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.<ref name=\"Walker2010\">{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907\u2013942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}</ref>\n\n===Survey instruments===\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.<ref name=Wendorf2001/><ref name=\"Verplaetse2008\">{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265\u2013286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}</ref> Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes.

Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1\u201345|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}</ref> Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S.

This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA342}}</ref> Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA361 361\u2013362]}} The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self-expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars. They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346\u20131359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=|jstor=1131651}}</ref>\n\n[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79\u2013105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices. He theorized [[Volition (psychology)|willpower]], moral desires, and integrity have the capability for a person to act morally by the hierarchical order of virtues. He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events).

He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.</ref> suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time. Research has largely supported that willpower works like a \"moral muscle\" with a limited supply of strength that may be depleted (a process referred to as Ego depletion), conserved, or replenished, and that a single act requiring much self-control can significantly deplete the \"supply\" of willpower.<ref name=\":4\" /> While exertion reduces the ability to engage in further acts of willpower in the short term, such exertions actually improve a person's ability to exert willpower for extended periods in the long run.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Muraven|first1=Mark|last2=Baumeister|first2=Roy F.|last3=Tice|first3=Dianne M.|date=August 1, 1999|title=Longitudinal Improvement of Self-Regulation Through Practice: Building Self-Control Strength Through Repeated Exercise|url=https://www.albany.edu/~muraven/publications/promotion%20files/articles/muraven,%20baumeister,%20&%20tice,%201999.pdf|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=139|issue=4|pages=446\u2013457|doi=10.1080/00224549909598404|issn=0022-4545|pmid=10457761}}</ref> Additional research has been conducted that may [[Ego depletion#Reproducibility controversy and conflicting meta analyses|cast doubt on the idea of ego-depletion]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/c17hie7wh4yaohd/Hagger%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20A%20Multilab%20Preregistered%20Replication%20of%20the%20Ego-Depletion%20Effect.pdf?dl=0 | title=Hagger et al (2016) A Multilab Preregistered Replication of the Ego-Depletion Effect.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Moral intuitions===\n{{Main|Social intuitionism|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\nIn 2001, Jonathan Haidt introduced his [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist model]]<nowiki/> which claimed that with few exceptions, moral judgments are made based upon socially derived intuitions. Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she is feeling). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\". This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly.

However, Cardinal Trujillo had himself been general secretary of CELAM, and president of CELAM's Reflection Task Force. [[Antonio Samor\u00e8|Cardinal Samor\u00e8]], who as leader of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]] was in charge of relations between the [[Roman Curia]] and CELAM, was ordered to put a stop to liberation theology, which was judged antithetical to the Catholic Church's global teachings.</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Previous note does not give sources for CELAM's attitude to Lib Theol|date=May 2015}}\n\nMore or less at the same time as the initial publications of Latin American liberation theology are also found voices of [[black theology|Black liberation theology]] and [[feminist theology|feminist liberation theology]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Liberation Theology|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/liberation_theology.aspx|journal=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas|last1=Vuola|first1=Elina|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, CELAM held two conferences which were important in determining the future of liberation theology: [[Second Episcopal Conference of Latin America|the first]] was held in [[Conference of Latin American Bishops|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]], in 1968, and the second in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.<ref name=\"Pelton 1995\" /> The Medell\u00edn conference debated how to apply the teachings of Vatican II to Latin America, and its conclusions were strongly influenced by liberation theology.<ref name=\"Wojda, Paul J. 1995\" /> Although liberation theology grew out of these officially recognized ideas, the Medell\u00edn document is not a liberation theology document.

Thus, the 1979 Puebla Conference was an opportunity for orthodox bishops to reassert control of the radical elements, but they failed. At the Puebla Conference, the orthodox reorientation was met by strong opposition from the liberal part of the clergy, which supported the concept of a \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\". This concept had been approved at the Medell\u00edn conference by Ricard Durand, president of the [[Commission about Poverty]].\n\nPope John Paul II gave the opening speech at the Puebla Conference. The general tone of his remarks was conciliatory. He criticized radical liberation theology, saying, \"this idea of Christ as a political figure, a revolutionary, as the subversive of Nazareth, does not tally with the Church's [[Catechism|catechesis]]\";<ref name=\"Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1979/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19790128_messico-puebla-episc-latam.html|title=To members of the 3rd General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate, Puebla \u2013 Republic of Mexico (January 28, 1979) \u2013 John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> however, he did acknowledge that \"the growing wealth of a few parallels the growing poverty of the masses,\"<ref name=\"Speech\" /> and affirmed both the ''principle'' of private property and that the Church \"must preach, educate individuals and collectivities, form public opinion, and offer orientations to the leaders of the peoples\" towards the goal of a \"more just and equitable distribution of goods\".<ref name=\"Speech\" />\n\nSome liberation theologians, however, including Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, had been barred from attending the Puebla Conference. Working from a seminary and with aid from sympathetic, liberal bishops, they partially obstructed other clergy's efforts to ensure that the Puebla Conference documents satisfied conservative concerns. Within four hours of the Pope's speech, Guti\u00e9rrez and the other priests wrote a 20-page refutation, which was circulated at the conference, and has been claimed to have influenced the final outcome of the conference. According to a socio-political study of liberation theology in Latin America, a quarter of the final Puebla documents were written by theologians who were ''not invited'' to the conference.<ref>Smith, Christian. ''The Emergence of Liberation Theology''</ref>\n\n=== Theology ===\nLiberation theology could be interpreted as an attempt to return to the [[gospel]] of the [[early church]] where Christianity is politically and culturally decentralized.<ref>ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLES, Populorum Progressio, Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI promulgated on March 26, 1967</ref>\n\nLiberation theology proposes to fight poverty by addressing its alleged source, the [[sin]] of greed. In so doing, it explores the relationship between [[Christian theology]] (especially [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]]) and political activism, especially in relation to [[economic justice]], [[poverty]], and [[human rights]]. The principal methodological innovation is seeing theology from the perspective of the poor and the oppressed. For example, [[Jon Sobrino]] argues that the poor are a privileged channel of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].\n\nSome liberation theologians base their social action upon the [[Bible]] scriptures describing the mission of [[Jesus Christ]], as [[But to bring a sword|bringing a sword]] ([[social unrest]]), e.g., {{bible verse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Matthew|10:34|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Luke|22:35\u201338|KJV}} \u2014 and ''not'' as bringing peace ([[social order]]).{{Better source|date=May 2010}} This biblical interpretation is a call to ''action'' against poverty, and the sin engendering it, to affect Jesus Christ's mission of justice in this world.\n\n[[Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez]] gave the movement its name with his 1971 book, ''A Theology of Liberation''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teolog\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n: perspectivas|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Publicaciones (CEP)|year=1971|isbn=|location=Lima, Per\u00fa|pages=}}</ref> In this book, Guti\u00e9rrez combined populist ideas with the social teachings of the Catholic Church. He was influenced by an existing socialist current in the Church which included organizations such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and the ''[[Jeunesse Ouvri\u00e8re Chr\u00e9tienne]]'', a Belgian Christian youth worker organization. He was also influenced by [[Paul Gauthier (theologian)|Paul Gauthier]]'s ''[[The Poor, Jesus and the Church]]'' (1965). Guti\u00e9rrez's book is based on an understanding of history in which the human being is seen as assuming conscious responsibility for human destiny, and yet Christ the Saviour liberates the human race from sin, which is the root of all disruption of friendship and of all injustice and oppression.<ref>Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation''(London: SCM Press,1974) 36f</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also popularized the phrase \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\", which became a slogan of liberation theology and later appeared in addresses of the Pope.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ratzinger | first = Joseph | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Fathers of the General Congregation of the Society of Jesus | website = Speeches February 2008 | publisher = The Holy See | date = February 21, 2008 | url = https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080221_gesuiti_en.html }}</ref> Drawing from the biblical motif on the poor, Guti\u00e9rrez asserts that God is revealed as having a preference for those people who are \u201cinsignificant\", \"marginalized\", \u201cunimportant\", \"needy\", \"despised\", and \"defenseless\". Moreover, he makes clear that terminology of \"the poor\" in scripture has social and economic connotations that etymologically go back to the Greek word, ''pt\u014dchos''.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo. The God of Life. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1991. (Original: El Dios de la vida. Lima: CEP, 1989.) p. 112</ref> To be sure, as to not misinterpret Guti\u00e9rrez's definition of the term \"preferential option\", he stresses, \"Preference implies the universality of God\u2019s love, which excludes no one. It is only within the framework of this universality that we can understand the preference, that is, 'what comes first'.\"<ref>Nickoloff, James B. ed. Gustavo Gutierrez: Essential Writings. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1996, p. 145</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez emphasized practice (or, more technically, \"[[praxis (process)|praxis]]\") over doctrine.  Guti\u00e9rrez clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between [[orthodoxy]] and [[orthopraxis]] seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo.

Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Online version: Harper Collins}}</ref> Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows:\n\n<blockquote>God is disclosed in the historical \"praxis\" of liberation. It is the situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of the poor and the oppressed.<ref>McBrien, R.P. \"Catholicism\" (Harper Collins, 1995), pp. 249\u2013250.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother important hallmark for Guti\u00e9rrez's brand of liberation theology is an interpretation of revelation as \"history\". For example, Guti\u00e9rrez wrote:\n\n<blockquote>History is the scene of the revelation God makes of the mystery of his person. His word reaches us in the measure of our involvement in the evolution of history.<ref>Gutierrez, G. \"Faith as Freedom,\" \u2018\u2019Horizons\u2019\u2019 2/1, Spring 1975, p.32</ref></blockquote>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also considered the Church to be the \"sacrament of history\", an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, thus pointing to the doctrine of universal salvation as the true means to eternal life, and assigning the Church itself to a somewhat temporal role, namely, liberation.\n\n=== Practice ===\nOne of the most radical aspects of liberation theology was the social organization, or reorganization, of church practice through the model of [[Christian base communities]]. Liberation theology strove to be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] movement in practice, with biblical interpretation and liturgical practice designed by lay practitioners themselves, rather than by the orthodox Church hierarchy. In this context, sacred text interpretation is understood as \"praxis\". Liberation theology seeks to interpret the actions of the Catholic Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the poor and disadvantaged. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically target the severe disparities between rich and poor in the existing social and economic orders within the nations' political and corporate structures. It is a strong critique of the various economic and social structures, such as an oppressive government, dependence upon First World countries and the traditional hierarchical Church, that allow some to be extremely rich while others are unable to even have safe drinking water.<ref name=Williams />\n\nThe journalist and writer [[Penny Lernoux]] described this aspect of liberation theology in her numerous and committed writings intended to explain the movement's ideas in North America. Base communities were small gatherings, usually outside of churches, in which the Bible could be discussed, and Mass could be said. They were especially active in rural parts of Latin America where parish priests were not always available, as they placed a high value on [[Laity|lay]] participation. In May 2007, it was estimated that 80,000 base communities existed in Brazil.<ref name=\"nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/americas/07theology.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5089&en=34f757c655dbef9f&ex=1336190400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss \"As Pope Heads to Brazil, a Rival Theology Persists\"] ''The New York Times'' May 7, 2007.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously, [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]], the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]], and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] are three organizations that make use of liberation theology.<ref>[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html |date=March 11, 2012 }}, Canada & the World, February 10, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Brazilian liberation theology ===\nThe Brazilian Catholic Church is arguably one of the most theologically progressive Catholic congregations due, in large part, to a history of violent military and political conflicts as well as a divisive socioeconomic climate. During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military rule]] from 1964 to 1985, the Catholic Church and its members assumed responsibility to provide services to the poor and disenfranchised, often under threat of persecution. The Vatican II and Medell\u00edn conference innovations in liberation theology entered the Brazilian Church as the Brazilian lower classes experienced sharply deteriorating economic and political conditions. Among these were an increase in landownership concentration, a decline in wages and standards of living, and a rise in the military state's political repression and violence, including mass detainment, torture, and the assassination of political opponents.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n==== Base ecclesial communities ====\nAfter decades of repression from the government authorities, the liberationist Catholic Church in Brazil is absent of traditional centralization and encourages an increased lay participation. Faced with a severe priest shortage, much of the Brazilian Catholic Church is organized into Base Ecclesial Communities or, \"CEBs\" in which the Mass, community spirituality programs, and community needs are led or addressed by a single clergy member or a trained lay member in either a small chapel or an individual's home. The CEBs introduced new social ideas and democratic methods which led to many participants' active involvement in popular movements of Brazil that worked for progressive social change. An example of progressive social change initiated by the CEBs is in [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]]. A health program began there to try to organize the population in order to remedy widespread malnutrition, open sewers, and other health hazards.<ref name=Williams /> Eventually the neighbourhood initiative reached a national interest level where it then became a mass movement in nearly every neighbourhood. Initiatives like the health program in Nova Igua\u00e7u illustrate how CEBs have helped the transition from military to democratic rule.\n\nWhile liberation theology has brought about significant progressive reforms in Brazil, anthropologist Robin Nagle questions the effectiveness of Catholic Church theology in Brazil. Nagle concentrates on the conflict between conservatives and liberationists in [[Recife]], Brazil, in 1990. The poor neighbourhood of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had a liberationist priest named Reginaldo who was expelled by the traditionalist archbishop because the archbishop found Reginaldo's politics and social theology annoying and adverse to his own agenda. When Reginaldo and his followers refused to accept the expulsion and the new priest, the archbishop called in the Military Police. Conversely, the event did not cause a mass response because the liberationist agenda aroused distrust and even hatred among many of its intended audience. The main reason was that it was too much to ask poor parishioners to embrace a Church focused more on the troubles of this life than solace in the next.<ref name=Virgin>''Claiming the Virgin:The Broken Promise of Liberation Theology in Brazil''. Robin Nagle. New York: Routledge, 1997. xii+224 pp., addendums, notes, glossary, bibliography, index.</ref>\n\nWhile Robin Nagle claims that liberation theology is ineffective for genuine social change, anthropologist Manuel V\u00e1squez argues that liberation theology embraced by CEBs create a twofold effect, because it not only provided moral justification for resistance but it also served as a means to organize the resistance. Many people come to the CEB through conversion experiences, but also because they are keenly concerned with the spiritual and infrastructural needs of their community.<ref name=Vasquez>The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity. Manuel A. Vasquez. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 302 pp.</ref> Through his fieldwork in working-class neighbourhoods of [[Rio de Janeiro]], V\u00e1squez reveals that CEBs combat disenfranchisement but also serve to overcome the obstacles associated with materialism and globalization. The social and political impact can be viewed in terms of initial consciousness-raising, the motivation for involvement, the sense of community they develop, the experience of grassroots democracy, the direct actions they engage in, and finally, directly political actions.<ref name=Williams />\n\n==== Liberation theology and indigenous Brazil ====\n\n===== The Tapeba =====\nAnthropologist and author Max Maranh\u00e3o Piorsky Aires analyzes the influence of liberation theology on the transformation of the indigenous [[Tapeba people]] of Brazil from poor, uneducated inhabitants neglected by the state to rights-bearing and involved citizens. Specifically he largely attributes the work of the Brazilian Catholic Church to the progression of the Tapeba. The Catholic Church enlisted state authorities, [[anthropologist]]s, and journalists to help uncover the identity of neglected indigenous peoples of Brazil. Early recognition by missionaries and followers of liberation theology stimulated indigenous identification of the Tapeba population as a possibility for attaining rights, especially land, health, and education.<ref name=Tapeba>{{cite journal | last1 = Maranhao Piorsky Aires | first1 = Max | year = 2012 | title = Legalizing Indigenous Identities: The Tapeba Struggle for Land and Schools in Caucaia, Brazil | url = | journal = The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 320\u2013340 }}</ref> The Church gathered and contributed historical knowledge of indigenous territory and identity of the Tapeba in Caucaia that ultimately succeeded in the tribes obtaining a legally codified identity as well as a rightful place as Brazilian subjects.\n\n===== Gurup\u00e1 =====\nIn [[Gurup\u00e1]], the Catholic Church employed liberation theology to defend indigenous tribes, farmers, and extractors from land expropriation by federal or corporate forces. New religious ideas, in the form of liberation theology, have fortified and legitimized an evolving political culture of resistance.<ref name=Gurupa>{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = R | year = 1992 | title = Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurup\u00e1 | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 710\u2013732 | doi = 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the Church-supported Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs) have promoted stronger social connections among community members that has led to more effective activism in Gurup\u00e1. Anthropologist Richard Pace's study of Gurup\u00e1 revealed that CEBs assured safety in united activism, and, combined with liberation theology, encouraged members to challenge landowner's commercial monopolies and fight for better standards of living. Pace references a specific incident in the CEB of [[Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima, Santa Maria|Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima]], in which a community of 24 families of farmers, timber extractors, and traders resisted an extra-regional timber extraction firm. The community negotiated an agreement with the firm that gained them a higher standard of living that included imported goods, increased food availability, and access to health care. While severe social dislocations such as government-initiated capitalist penetration, land expropriation, and poor wages persist, small-farmer activism is fortified by liberation theology and receives structural support from unions, political parties, and church organizations.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n=== Vatican reaction ===\n\n==== Joseph Ratzinger ====\nIn March 1983, Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), head of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF), made ten observations of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez's theology, accusing Guti\u00e9rrez of politically interpreting the Bible in supporting temporal messianism, and stating that the predominance of [[orthopraxis]] over orthodoxy in his thought proved a Marxist influence. Ratzinger objected that the spiritual concept of the Church as \"People of God\" is transformed into a \"Marxist myth\". In liberation theology he declared, the \"'people' is the antithesis of the hierarchy, the antithesis of all institutions, which are seen as oppressive powers. Ultimately anyone who participates in the class struggle is a member of the 'people'; the 'Church of the people' becomes the antagonist of the hierarchical Church.\"<ref name=preliminary>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Joseph Cardinal|title=\"Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes,\" in The Ratzinger Report.

Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Harper Collins, 2007|location=Online version}}</ref>\n\nRatzinger did praise liberation theology in some respects, including its ideal of justice, its rejection of violence, and its stress on \"the responsibility which Christians necessarily bear for the poor and oppressed\".<ref name=preliminary />  He subsequently stated that no one could be neutral in the face of injustice, and referred to the \"crimes\" of [[colonialism]] and the \"scandal\" of the [[arms race]]. Nonetheless, media reports tended to assume that the condemnation of \"liberation theology\" meant a rejection of such attitudes and an endorsement of [[conservative]] politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1984, it was reported that a meeting occurred between the CDF and the CELAM bishops, during which a rift developed between Ratzinger and some of the bishops,<ref name=\"Curti\" />  with Ratzinger issuing official condemnations of certain elements of liberation theology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|title=\"Instruction on certain aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'\" Origins 14/13|date=September 13, 1984|location=Online version}}[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19840806_theology-liberation_en.html Online version]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, .|title=\"Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation,\" Origins 15/44|date=April 17, 1986}}</ref> These \"Instructions\" rejected as Marxist the idea that [[class struggle]] is fundamental to history, and rejected the interpretation of religious phenomena such as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the [[Eucharist]] in exclusively political terms.  Ratzinger further stated that liberation theology had a major flaw in that it attempted to apply Christ's sermon on the mount teachings about the poor to present social situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Cardinal|title=op cit|year=1985}}</ref>  He asserted that Christ's teaching on the poor meant that we will be judged when we die, with particular attention to how we personally have treated the poor.\n\nRatzinger also argued that liberation theology is not originally a \"grass-roots\" movement among the poor, but rather, a creation of Western intellectuals: \"an attempt to test, in a concrete scenario, ideologies that have been invented in the laboratory by European theologians\" and in a certain sense itself a form of \"[[cultural imperialism]]\". Ratzinger saw this as a reaction to the demise or near-demise of the \"Marxist myth\" in the West.<ref name=preliminary />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, continued to condemn these elements in liberation theology, and prohibited dissident priests from teaching such doctrines in the Catholic Church's name. [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended and others were censured. [[Tissa Balasuriya]], in [[Sri Lanka]], was excommunicated. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, was also censured for his book ''Jesus and Freedom''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kappen|first=Sebastian|title=Jesus and Freedom. In 1980, the CDF asked the General of the Society of Jesus (of which Kappen was a member) to disavow this book. Kappen responded with a pamphlet entitled \"Censorship and the Future of Asian Theology.\" No further action was taken by the Vatican on this matter|year=1977}}</ref> Under Ratzinger's influence, theological formation schools were forbidden from using the Catholic Church's organization and grounds to teach liberation theology in the sense of theology using unacceptable Marxist ideas, not in the broader sense.\n\n==== Towards reconciliation under Pope Francis ====\nAccording to Roberto Bosca, a historian at [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Pope Francis|Jorge Bergoglio]] (later Pope Francis) had \"a reputation as an opponent of liberation theology during the 1970s\" but he \"accepted the premise of liberation theology, especially the option for the poor, but in a 'nonideological' fashion.\"<ref name=Allen2013 /> Before becoming Pope, Bergoglio said, \"The option for the poor comes from the first centuries of Christianity. It's the Gospel itself. If you were to read one of the sermons of the first [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Church]], from the second or third centuries, about how you should treat the poor, you\u2019d say it was [[Maoism|Maoist]] or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]].

As a rule, this articulation involves a condemnation of the State of [[Israel]], a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of [[Jesus]] and the [[Bible]].

[[Antonio Samor\u00e8|Cardinal Samor\u00e8]], who as leader of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]] was in charge of relations between the [[Roman Curia]] and CELAM, was ordered to put a stop to liberation theology, which was judged antithetical to the Catholic Church's global teachings.</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Previous note does not give sources for CELAM's attitude to Lib Theol|date=May 2015}}\n\nMore or less at the same time as the initial publications of Latin American liberation theology are also found voices of [[black theology|Black liberation theology]] and [[feminist theology|feminist liberation theology]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Liberation Theology|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/liberation_theology.aspx|journal=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas|last1=Vuola|first1=Elina|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, CELAM held two conferences which were important in determining the future of liberation theology: [[Second Episcopal Conference of Latin America|the first]] was held in [[Conference of Latin American Bishops|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]], in 1968, and the second in [[Puebla]], Mexico, in January 1979.<ref name=\"Pelton 1995\" /> The Medell\u00edn conference debated how to apply the teachings of Vatican II to Latin America, and its conclusions were strongly influenced by liberation theology.<ref name=\"Wojda, Paul J. 1995\" /> Although liberation theology grew out of these officially recognized ideas, the Medell\u00edn document is not a liberation theology document.

Thus, the 1979 Puebla Conference was an opportunity for orthodox bishops to reassert control of the radical elements, but they failed. At the Puebla Conference, the orthodox reorientation was met by strong opposition from the liberal part of the clergy, which supported the concept of a \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\". This concept had been approved at the Medell\u00edn conference by Ricard Durand, president of the [[Commission about Poverty]].\n\nPope John Paul II gave the opening speech at the Puebla Conference. The general tone of his remarks was conciliatory. He criticized radical liberation theology, saying, \"this idea of Christ as a political figure, a revolutionary, as the subversive of Nazareth, does not tally with the Church's [[Catechism|catechesis]]\";<ref name=\"Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1979/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19790128_messico-puebla-episc-latam.html|title=To members of the 3rd General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate, Puebla \u2013 Republic of Mexico (January 28, 1979) \u2013 John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> however, he did acknowledge that \"the growing wealth of a few parallels the growing poverty of the masses,\"<ref name=\"Speech\" /> and affirmed both the ''principle'' of private property and that the Church \"must preach, educate individuals and collectivities, form public opinion, and offer orientations to the leaders of the peoples\" towards the goal of a \"more just and equitable distribution of goods\".<ref name=\"Speech\" />\n\nSome liberation theologians, however, including Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, had been barred from attending the Puebla Conference. Working from a seminary and with aid from sympathetic, liberal bishops, they partially obstructed other clergy's efforts to ensure that the Puebla Conference documents satisfied conservative concerns. Within four hours of the Pope's speech, Guti\u00e9rrez and the other priests wrote a 20-page refutation, which was circulated at the conference, and has been claimed to have influenced the final outcome of the conference. According to a socio-political study of liberation theology in Latin America, a quarter of the final Puebla documents were written by theologians who were ''not invited'' to the conference.<ref>Smith, Christian.

In so doing, it explores the relationship between [[Christian theology]] (especially [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]]) and political activism, especially in relation to [[economic justice]], [[poverty]], and [[human rights]]. The principal methodological innovation is seeing theology from the perspective of the poor and the oppressed. For example, [[Jon Sobrino]] argues that the poor are a privileged channel of [[Grace (Christianity)|God's grace]].\n\nSome liberation theologians base their social action upon the [[Bible]] scriptures describing the mission of [[Jesus Christ]], as [[But to bring a sword|bringing a sword]] ([[social unrest]]), e.g., {{bible verse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Matthew|10:34|KJV}}, {{bible verse||Luke|22:35\u201338|KJV}} \u2014 and ''not'' as bringing peace ([[social order]]).{{Better source|date=May 2010}} This biblical interpretation is a call to ''action'' against poverty, and the sin engendering it, to affect Jesus Christ's mission of justice in this world.\n\n[[Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez]] gave the movement its name with his 1971 book, ''A Theology of Liberation''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teolog\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n: perspectivas|last=Guti\u00e9rrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Publicaciones (CEP)|year=1971|isbn=|location=Lima, Per\u00fa|pages=}}</ref> In this book, Guti\u00e9rrez combined populist ideas with the social teachings of the Catholic Church.

He was also influenced by [[Paul Gauthier (theologian)|Paul Gauthier]]'s ''[[The Poor, Jesus and the Church]]'' (1965). Guti\u00e9rrez's book is based on an understanding of history in which the human being is seen as assuming conscious responsibility for human destiny, and yet Christ the Saviour liberates the human race from sin, which is the root of all disruption of friendship and of all injustice and oppression.<ref>Gustavo Gutierrez, ''A Theology of Liberation''(London: SCM Press,1974) 36f</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also popularized the phrase \"[[preferential option for the poor]]\", which became a slogan of liberation theology and later appeared in addresses of the Pope.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ratzinger | first = Joseph | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Fathers of the General Congregation of the Society of Jesus | website = Speeches February 2008 | publisher = The Holy See | date = February 21, 2008 | url = https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080221_gesuiti_en.html }}</ref> Drawing from the biblical motif on the poor, Guti\u00e9rrez asserts that God is revealed as having a preference for those people who are \u201cinsignificant\", \"marginalized\", \u201cunimportant\", \"needy\", \"despised\", and \"defenseless\".

Guti\u00e9rrez clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between [[orthodoxy]] and [[orthopraxis]] seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.<ref>Gutierrez, Gustavo.

Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Online version: Harper Collins}}</ref> Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows:\n\n<blockquote>God is disclosed in the historical \"praxis\" of liberation. It is the situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of the poor and the oppressed.<ref>McBrien, R.P. \"Catholicism\" (Harper Collins, 1995), pp. 249\u2013250.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother important hallmark for Guti\u00e9rrez's brand of liberation theology is an interpretation of revelation as \"history\". For example, Guti\u00e9rrez wrote:\n\n<blockquote>History is the scene of the revelation God makes of the mystery of his person. His word reaches us in the measure of our involvement in the evolution of history.<ref>Gutierrez, G. \"Faith as Freedom,\" \u2018\u2019Horizons\u2019\u2019 2/1, Spring 1975, p.32</ref></blockquote>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez also considered the Church to be the \"sacrament of history\", an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, thus pointing to the doctrine of universal salvation as the true means to eternal life, and assigning the Church itself to a somewhat temporal role, namely, liberation.\n\n=== Practice ===\nOne of the most radical aspects of liberation theology was the social organization, or reorganization, of church practice through the model of [[Christian base communities]]. Liberation theology strove to be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] movement in practice, with biblical interpretation and liturgical practice designed by lay practitioners themselves, rather than by the orthodox Church hierarchy. In this context, sacred text interpretation is understood as \"praxis\". Liberation theology seeks to interpret the actions of the Catholic Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the poor and disadvantaged. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically target the severe disparities between rich and poor in the existing social and economic orders within the nations' political and corporate structures. It is a strong critique of the various economic and social structures, such as an oppressive government, dependence upon First World countries and the traditional hierarchical Church, that allow some to be extremely rich while others are unable to even have safe drinking water.<ref name=Williams />\n\nThe journalist and writer [[Penny Lernoux]] described this aspect of liberation theology in her numerous and committed writings intended to explain the movement's ideas in North America. Base communities were small gatherings, usually outside of churches, in which the Bible could be discussed, and Mass could be said. They were especially active in rural parts of Latin America where parish priests were not always available, as they placed a high value on [[Laity|lay]] participation. In May 2007, it was estimated that 80,000 base communities existed in Brazil.<ref name=\"nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/americas/07theology.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5089&en=34f757c655dbef9f&ex=1336190400&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss \"As Pope Heads to Brazil, a Rival Theology Persists\"] ''The New York Times'' May 7, 2007.</ref>\n\nContemporaneously, [[Fanmi Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]], the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]], and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] are three organizations that make use of liberation theology.<ref>[http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html Liberation Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311004611/http://betacanadaandtheworld.com/liberationtheology.html |date=March 11, 2012 }}, Canada & the World, February 10, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Brazilian liberation theology ===\nThe Brazilian Catholic Church is arguably one of the most theologically progressive Catholic congregations due, in large part, to a history of violent military and political conflicts as well as a divisive socioeconomic climate. During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military rule]] from 1964 to 1985, the Catholic Church and its members assumed responsibility to provide services to the poor and disenfranchised, often under threat of persecution. The Vatican II and Medell\u00edn conference innovations in liberation theology entered the Brazilian Church as the Brazilian lower classes experienced sharply deteriorating economic and political conditions. Among these were an increase in landownership concentration, a decline in wages and standards of living, and a rise in the military state's political repression and violence, including mass detainment, torture, and the assassination of political opponents.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n==== Base ecclesial communities ====\nAfter decades of repression from the government authorities, the liberationist Catholic Church in Brazil is absent of traditional centralization and encourages an increased lay participation. Faced with a severe priest shortage, much of the Brazilian Catholic Church is organized into Base Ecclesial Communities or, \"CEBs\" in which the Mass, community spirituality programs, and community needs are led or addressed by a single clergy member or a trained lay member in either a small chapel or an individual's home. The CEBs introduced new social ideas and democratic methods which led to many participants' active involvement in popular movements of Brazil that worked for progressive social change. An example of progressive social change initiated by the CEBs is in [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]]. A health program began there to try to organize the population in order to remedy widespread malnutrition, open sewers, and other health hazards.<ref name=Williams /> Eventually the neighbourhood initiative reached a national interest level where it then became a mass movement in nearly every neighbourhood. Initiatives like the health program in Nova Igua\u00e7u illustrate how CEBs have helped the transition from military to democratic rule.\n\nWhile liberation theology has brought about significant progressive reforms in Brazil, anthropologist Robin Nagle questions the effectiveness of Catholic Church theology in Brazil. Nagle concentrates on the conflict between conservatives and liberationists in [[Recife]], Brazil, in 1990. The poor neighbourhood of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had a liberationist priest named Reginaldo who was expelled by the traditionalist archbishop because the archbishop found Reginaldo's politics and social theology annoying and adverse to his own agenda. When Reginaldo and his followers refused to accept the expulsion and the new priest, the archbishop called in the Military Police. Conversely, the event did not cause a mass response because the liberationist agenda aroused distrust and even hatred among many of its intended audience. The main reason was that it was too much to ask poor parishioners to embrace a Church focused more on the troubles of this life than solace in the next.<ref name=Virgin>''Claiming the Virgin:The Broken Promise of Liberation Theology in Brazil''. Robin Nagle. New York: Routledge, 1997. xii+224 pp., addendums, notes, glossary, bibliography, index.</ref>\n\nWhile Robin Nagle claims that liberation theology is ineffective for genuine social change, anthropologist Manuel V\u00e1squez argues that liberation theology embraced by CEBs create a twofold effect, because it not only provided moral justification for resistance but it also served as a means to organize the resistance. Many people come to the CEB through conversion experiences, but also because they are keenly concerned with the spiritual and infrastructural needs of their community.<ref name=Vasquez>The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity. Manuel A. Vasquez. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 302 pp.</ref> Through his fieldwork in working-class neighbourhoods of [[Rio de Janeiro]], V\u00e1squez reveals that CEBs combat disenfranchisement but also serve to overcome the obstacles associated with materialism and globalization. The social and political impact can be viewed in terms of initial consciousness-raising, the motivation for involvement, the sense of community they develop, the experience of grassroots democracy, the direct actions they engage in, and finally, directly political actions.<ref name=Williams />\n\n==== Liberation theology and indigenous Brazil ====\n\n===== The Tapeba =====\nAnthropologist and author Max Maranh\u00e3o Piorsky Aires analyzes the influence of liberation theology on the transformation of the indigenous [[Tapeba people]] of Brazil from poor, uneducated inhabitants neglected by the state to rights-bearing and involved citizens. Specifically he largely attributes the work of the Brazilian Catholic Church to the progression of the Tapeba. The Catholic Church enlisted state authorities, [[anthropologist]]s, and journalists to help uncover the identity of neglected indigenous peoples of Brazil. Early recognition by missionaries and followers of liberation theology stimulated indigenous identification of the Tapeba population as a possibility for attaining rights, especially land, health, and education.<ref name=Tapeba>''Legalizing Indigenous Identities: The Tapeba Struggle for Land and Schools in Caucaia, Brazil''. Max Maranhao Piorsky Aires. The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 320\u2013340. 2012.</ref> The Church gathered and contributed historical knowledge of indigenous territory and identity of the Tapeba in Caucaia that ultimately succeeded in the tribes obtaining a legally codified identity as well as a rightful place as Brazilian subjects.\n\n===== Gurup\u00e1 =====\nIn [[Gurup\u00e1]], the Catholic Church employed liberation theology to defend indigenous tribes, farmers, and extractors from land expropriation by federal or corporate forces. New religious ideas, in the form of liberation theology, have fortified and legitimized an evolving political culture of resistance.<ref name=Gurupa>PACE, R. (1992), Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurup\u00e1. American Ethnologist, 19: 710\u2013732. doi: 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050</ref> Meanwhile, the Church-supported Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs) have promoted stronger social connections among community members that has led to more effective activism in Gurup\u00e1. Anthropologist Richard Pace's study of Gurup\u00e1 revealed that CEBs assured safety in united activism, and, combined with liberation theology, encouraged members to challenge landowner's commercial monopolies and fight for better standards of living. Pace references a specific incident in the CEB of [[Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima, Santa Maria|Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima]], in which a community of 24 families of farmers, timber extractors, and traders resisted an extra-regional timber extraction firm. The community negotiated an agreement with the firm that gained them a higher standard of living that included imported goods, increased food availability, and access to health care. While severe social dislocations such as government-initiated capitalist penetration, land expropriation, and poor wages persist, small-farmer activism is fortified by liberation theology and receives structural support from unions, political parties, and church organizations.<ref name=Gurupa />\n\n=== Vatican reaction ===\n\n==== Joseph Ratzinger ====\nIn March 1983, Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), head of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF), made ten observations of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez's theology, accusing Guti\u00e9rrez of politically interpreting the Bible in supporting temporal messianism, and stating that the predominance of [[orthopraxis]] over orthodoxy in his thought proved a Marxist influence. Ratzinger objected that the spiritual concept of the Church as \"People of God\" is transformed into a \"Marxist myth\". In liberation theology he declared, the \"'people' is the antithesis of the hierarchy, the antithesis of all institutions, which are seen as oppressive powers. Ultimately anyone who participates in the class struggle is a member of the 'people'; the 'Church of the people' becomes the antagonist of the hierarchical Church.\"<ref name=preliminary>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Joseph Cardinal|title=\"Liberation Theology: Preliminary Notes,\" in The Ratzinger Report. Reprinted in: J.F. Thornton and S.B. Varenne, eds., The Essential Pope Benedict XVI|year=2007|publisher=Harper Collins, 2007|location=Online version}}</ref>\n\nRatzinger did praise liberation theology in some respects, including its ideal of justice, its rejection of violence, and its stress on \"the responsibility which Christians necessarily bear for the poor and oppressed\".<ref name=preliminary />  He subsequently stated that no one could be neutral in the face of injustice, and referred to the \"crimes\" of [[colonialism]] and the \"scandal\" of the [[arms race]]. Nonetheless, media reports tended to assume that the condemnation of \"liberation theology\" meant a rejection of such attitudes and an endorsement of [[conservative]] politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1984, it was reported that a meeting occurred between the CDF and the CELAM bishops, during which a rift developed between Ratzinger and some of the bishops,<ref name=\"Curti\" />  with Ratzinger issuing official condemnations of certain elements of liberation theology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|title=\"Instruction on certain aspects of the 'Theology of Liberation,'\" Origins 14/13|date=September 13, 1984|location=Online version}}[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19840806_theology-liberation_en.html Online version]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, .|title=\"Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation,\" Origins 15/44|date=April 17, 1986}}</ref> These \"Instructions\" rejected as Marxist the idea that [[class struggle]] is fundamental to history, and rejected the interpretation of religious phenomena such as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the [[Eucharist]] in exclusively political terms.  Ratzinger further stated that liberation theology had a major flaw in that it attempted to apply Christ's sermon on the mount teachings about the poor to present social situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ratzinger|first=Cardinal|title=op cit|year=1985}}</ref>  He asserted that Christ's teaching on the poor meant that we will be judged when we die, with particular attention to how we personally have treated the poor.\n\nRatzinger also argued that liberation theology is not originally a \"grass-roots\" movement among the poor, but rather, a creation of Western intellectuals: \"an attempt to test, in a concrete scenario, ideologies that have been invented in the laboratory by European theologians\" and in a certain sense itself a form of \"[[cultural imperialism]]\". Ratzinger saw this as a reaction to the demise or near-demise of the \"Marxist myth\" in the West.<ref name=preliminary />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, continued to condemn these elements in liberation theology, and prohibited dissident priests from teaching such doctrines in the Catholic Church's name. [[Leonardo Boff]] was suspended and others were censured. [[Tissa Balasuriya]], in [[Sri Lanka]], was excommunicated. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, was also censured for his book ''Jesus and Freedom''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kappen|first=Sebastian|title=Jesus and Freedom. In 1980, the CDF asked the General of the Society of Jesus (of which Kappen was a member) to disavow this book. Kappen responded with a pamphlet entitled \"Censorship and the Future of Asian Theology.\" No further action was taken by the Vatican on this matter|year=1977}}</ref> Under Ratzinger's influence, theological formation schools were forbidden from using the Catholic Church's organization and grounds to teach liberation theology in the sense of theology using unacceptable Marxist ideas, not in the broader sense.\n\n==== Towards reconciliation under Pope Francis ====\nAccording to Roberto Bosca, a historian at [[Austral University (Argentina)|Austral University]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Pope Francis|Jorge Bergoglio]] (later Pope Francis) had \"a reputation as an opponent of liberation theology during the 1970s\" but he \"accepted the premise of liberation theology, especially the option for the poor, but in a 'nonideological' fashion.\"<ref name=Allen2013 /> Before becoming Pope, Bergoglio said, \"The option for the poor comes from the first centuries of Christianity. It's the Gospel itself. If you were to read one of the sermons of the first [[Church Fathers|fathers of the Church]], from the second or third centuries, about how you should treat the poor, you\u2019d say it was [[Maoism|Maoist]] or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]].

It especially focuses on the [[injustice]]s committed against [[African American]]s and black [[South African people|South Africans]] during [[Jim Crow laws|American segregation]] and [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], respectively.\n\nBlack theology seeks to liberate people of color from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views [[Christian theology]] as a theology of liberation\u2014\"a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is [[Jesus]] Christ,\" writes [[James H. Cone|James Hal Cone]], one of the original advocates of the perspective. Black theology mixes [[Christianity]] with questions of [[civil rights]], particularly raised by the [[Black Power movement]] and the [[Black Consciousness Movement]].\n\n== Palestinian liberation theology ==\n{{See also|Political theology in the Middle East#Palestinian liberation theology}}\nPalestinian liberation theology is an expression of [[Political theology in the Middle East|political theology]] and a [[inculturation|contextual theology]] that represents an attempt by a number of independently working Palestinian theologians from various denominations\u2014mostly [[Protestant]] mainline churches\u2014to articulate the gospel message in such a way as to make that liberating gospel relevant to the perceived needs of their indigenous flocks. As a rule, this articulation involves a condemnation of the State of [[Israel]], a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of [[Jesus]] and the [[Bible]]. The principal figure in Palestinian liberation theology is the [[Anglican]] cleric [[Naim Ateek]], founder of the [[Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ateek|first1=Naim|title=Justice and only Justice|date=1989|publisher=Orbis}}</ref>\n\n== Related movements ==\n* [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]]<ref name=\"interactivist\">{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/4890/|title=Interactivist: Liberation Theology \u2013 Abahlali baseMjondolo|publisher=abahlali.org}}</ref>\n* [[Dalit theology]] in [[India]]\n* [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]]\n* [[Fanmi Lavalas|Lavalas]] in [[Haiti]]<ref name=\"interactivist\" />\n** [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]\n* [[FSLN]] in [[Nicaragua]] (see [[The Catholic Church and the Nicaraguan Revolution]])\n* [[FMLN]] in [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Christians for Socialism]] (Cristianos por el socialismo)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Catholicism}}\n{{div col|colwidth=26em|content=\n*[[Buddhist socialism]]\n*[[Catholic Church and politics]]\n*[[Catholic social teaching]]\n*[[Christian left]]\n*[[Christian socialism]]\n*[[Christian views on poverty and wealth]]\n*[[Christianity and politics]]\n*[[Cuernavaca Center for Intercultural Dialogue on Development]]\n*[[Evangelical left]]\n*[[Islamic socialism]]\n*[[Liberal Christianity]]\n*[[Liberation theology in Canada]]\n*[[Marxism and religion]]\n*[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]\n*[[Political theology]]\n*[[Postcolonial theology]]\n*[[Progressive Christianity]]\n*[[Reconciliation theology]]\n*[[Religious socialism]]\n*[[Religious views on capitalism]]\n*[[Social Gospel]]\n*[[Spiritual left]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Liberation theology|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Liberation theology]]\n}}\n\n=== People ===\n*[[Paulo Freire]]\n*[[\u00d3scar Romero]]\n\n==== Theologians ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em|content=\n* [[Marcella Althaus-Reid]], [[Argentina]] \u2013 [[Scotland]] (1952\u20132009)\n* [[Paulo Evaristo Arns]], [[Brazil]] (1921\u20132016)\n* [[Rubem Alves]], [[Brazil]] (1933\u20132014)\n* [[Naim Ateek]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] (b. 1937)\n* [[Alan Boesak]], South Africa (b. 1945)\n* [[Leonardo Boff]], [[Brazil]] (b. 1938)\n* [[Robert McAfee Brown]], US (1920\u20132001)\n* [[H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara]], [[Brazil]] (1909\u20131999), Archbishop of [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]\n* [[Pedro Casald\u00e1liga]], Spain \u2013 [[Brazil]] (b. 1928)\n* [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Nicaragua]] (1925\u20132020)\n* [[Fernando Cardenal]], [[Nicaragua]] (1934\u20132016)\n* {{ill|Jos\u00e9 Severino Croatto|es||de}}, [[Argentina]] (1930\u20132004)\n* [[Miguel A.

Nominally edited by the poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], most editing fell to the sub-editor [[Cyrus Redding]]. Colburn paid contributors well, and they included [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Sydney Morgan]], [[Thomas Charles Morgan]], [[Peter George Patmore]], [[Mary Shelley]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]], [[Stendhal]], [[Thomas Noon Talfourd]], [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], [[Mary Russell Mitford]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer]], [[James and Horace Smith]], and [[William Hazlitt]].<ref>'Introduction', ''Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature''; Higgins, ''The Literary Encyclopedia''.</ref> Hazlitt's \"[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]\" essays, begun in the ''[[London Magazine]]'', appeared in the ''New Monthly'' from late 1821, his essay \"The Fight\" appeared in 1822,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7cCAAAAIAAJ&dq=The%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine%201822&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false New Monthly Magazine Vol 3, 1822 page 102] at Google Books</ref> and his series \"The Spirits of the Age'\" was later republished, with essays from other sources, in the book ''[[The Spirit of the Age]]'' (1825).<ref>Higgins, ''The Literary Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]]'s ''[[London Magazine]]'' merged with the ''New Monthly'' in 1829, and in that year [[Richard Bentley]] became Colburn's business partner. After Redding resigned in 1830, Campbell found himself unable to edit the magazine on his own and [[Samuel Carter Hall]] became editor for a year. In 1831 the novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer]] became editor, turning \"the essentially apolitical, slightly Whiggish, literary journal into a vigorous radical organ shouting 'Reform' at the top of its lungs.\"<ref>Introduction, ''Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals''</ref> Hall, a political Conservative, had remained as sub-editor, and resisted Bulwer's efforts: Bulwer resigned in 1833, with Hall taking up the editorship once more. Contributors now included [[Catherine Gore]], [[Anna Maria Hall]], [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Caroline Norton]], [[Thomas Haynes Bayley]], and [[Theodore Edward Hook]].\n\nIn 1837 the magazine was retitled '''''The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist''''', to meet the challenge of ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. Now edited by [[Theodore Hook]],<ref name=named/> it published contributions from [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]], [[Douglas Jerrold]], [[Frederick Marryat]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Charles Robert Forrester]], and [[W.

According to the [[ODNB]], the transcendentalist Francis Barham (1808\u20131871) edited the paper at around this time: \"Two hundred pounds invested in the New Monthly Magazine procured him the joint editorship with [[John Abraham Heraud]], the poet and dramatist.

It was founded by [[Henry Colburn]] and published by him through to 1845.\n\n==History==\nColburn and [[Frederic Shoberl]] established ''The New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register'' as a \"virulently Tory\"<ref>David Higgins, [http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&UID=1682 'The New Monthly Magazine'], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 22 October 2006.</ref> competitor to [[Sir Richard Phillips]]' ''[[Monthly Magazine (1796)|Monthly Magazine]]'' in 1814. \"The double-column format and the comprehensive contents combined the [[Gentleman's Magazine]] with the [[Annual Register]]\".<ref>'Introduction', ''Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature''</ref>\n\nIn its April 1819 issue it published [[John William Polidori|John Polidori]]'s [[Gothic fiction]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'', the first significant piece of prose [[vampire literature]] in English, attributing it to [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], who partly inspired it.\n\nIn 1821 Colburn recast the magazine with a more literary and less political focus, retitling it '''''The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal'''''. Nominally edited by the poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], most editing fell to the sub-editor [[Cyrus Redding]]. Colburn paid contributors well, and they included [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Sydney Morgan]], [[Thomas Charles Morgan]], [[Peter George Patmore]], [[Mary Shelley]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]], [[Stendhal]], [[Thomas Noon Talfourd]], [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], [[Mary Russell Mitford]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer]], [[James and Horace Smith]], and [[William Hazlitt]].<ref>'Introduction', ''Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature''; Higgins, ''The Literary Encyclopedia''.</ref> Hazlitt's \"[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]\" essays, begun in the ''[[London Magazine]]'', appeared in the ''New Monthly'' from late 1821, his essay \"The Fight\" appeared in 1822,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7cCAAAAIAAJ&dq=The%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine%201822&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false New Monthly Magazine Vol 3, 1822 page 102] at Google Books</ref> and his series \"The Spirits of the Age'\" was later republished, with essays from other sources, in the book ''[[The Spirit of the Age]]'' (1825).<ref>Higgins, ''The Literary Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]]'s ''[[London Magazine]]'' merged with the ''New Monthly'' in 1829, and in that year [[Richard Bentley]] became Colburn's business partner. After Redding resigned in 1830, Campbell found himself unable to edit the magazine on his own and [[Samuel Carter Hall]] became editor for a year. In 1831 the novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer]] became editor, turning \"the essentially apolitical, slightly Whiggish, literary journal into a vigorous radical organ shouting 'Reform' at the top of its lungs.\"<ref>Introduction, ''Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals''</ref> Hall, a political Conservative, had remained as sub-editor, and resisted Bulwer's efforts: Bulwer resigned in 1833, with Hall taking up the editorship once more. Contributors now included [[Catherine Gore]], [[Anna Maria Hall]], [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Caroline Norton]], [[Thomas Haynes Bayley]], and [[Theodore Edward Hook]].\n\nIn 1837 the magazine was retitled '''''The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist''''', to meet the challenge of ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. Now edited by [[Theodore Hook]],<ref name=named/> it published contributions from [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]], [[Douglas Jerrold]], [[Frederick Marryat]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Charles Robert Forrester]], and [[W. M. Thackeray]]. Upon Hook's death in 1841, [[Thomas Hood]] was editor until 1843.<ref name=named/><ref>'Introduction', ''Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature''. According to the [[ODNB]], the transcendentalist Francis Barham (1808\u20131871) edited the paper at around this time: \"Two hundred pounds invested in the New Monthly Magazine procured him the joint editorship with [[John Abraham Heraud]], the poet and dramatist.

Heraud's ODNB entry has him editing the ''Monthly Magazine'' from 1839 to 1842, but does not mention the ''New Monthly''.</ref>\n\nIn 1845 Colburn sold the magazine for \u00a32500 to [[William Harrison Ainsworth]], who had earlier edited ''Bentley's Miscellany'' and who now edited his own ''Ainsworth's Magazine''. Ainsworth edited the ''New Monthly'' with his cousin [[William Francis Ainsworth]] as sub-editor.<ref name=named/> From 1871\u201379 William Francis Ainsworth was editor.\n\n==Titles==\nOver the years, the magazine had several titles.

The band constantly shifted in musical style, drawing on genres such as [[punk rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music|folk]]. Their [[anarcho-communist]] or [[libertarian socialist]] political stance exhibited an irreverent attitude toward authority, and the band have been forthright in their stances on issues including [[animal rights]] and [[pacifism]] (early in their career) and later regarding [[class struggle]], [[marxism]], [[feminism]], [[gay liberation]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[anti-fascism]].\n\nThe band are best known for their song \"[[Tubthumping]]\", which was nominated for [[1998 Brit Awards#The awards|Best British Single]] at the [[1998 Brit Awards]]. Other singles include \"[[Amnesia (Chumbawamba song)|Amnesia]]\", \"[[Enough Is Enough (Chumbawumba song)|Enough Is Enough]]\" (with [[Credit to the Nation|MC Fusion]]), \"[[Timebomb (Chumbawamba song)|Timebomb]]\", \"[[Top of the World (Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9)]]\", and \"[[Add Me]]\".\n\nIn July 2012, Chumbawamba announced they were splitting up after 30 years.

Their first vinyl release was a track (\"Three Years Later\") on the [[Crass Records]] compilation album ''[[Bullshit Detector]] 2''.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[PiL]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], and [[Adam and the Ants]] and politically by the anarchist stance of [[Crass]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  Another of the band's early releases was under the name \"Skin Disease\", parodying the [[Oi!]] bands of the time so successfully that they were included on 'Back On The Streets', an Oi! compilation EP put together by ''Sounds'' magazine journalist [[Garry Bushell]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include [[Alice Nutter (writer)|Alice Nutter]] (of Ouch, My Hair's on Fire), and [[Dunstan Bruce|Dunstan \"Dunst\" Bruce]] (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a [[Squatting|squat]] in [[Armley]], [[Leeds]], with Harry \"Daz\" Hamer and Mavis \"Mave\" Dillon joining soon after.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  Stalwarts of the [[cassette culture]] scene, the band released a number of tapes including ''Be Happy Despite It All'' and ''Raising Heck With Chumbawamba'', and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s [[anarcho-punk]] movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as [[animal rights]], the [[anti-war]] movement, and community groups. The band's collective political views are often described as [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They made several songs about the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]], including the ''Common Ground'' cassette and a song dedicated to the [[pit village]] of [[Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire|Fitzwilliam]], which was one of the worst cases of economic decline following the strike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicdb.laadhari.com/Chumbawamba/Fitzwilliam/459081-lyrics.html |title=Fitzwilliam lyrics |website=Musicdb.laadhari.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822192523/http://musicdb.laadhari.com/Chumbawamba/Fitzwilliam/459081-lyrics.html |archive-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Sky and Trees and Agit-Prop Records===\nBy the mid-1980s Chumbawamba had begun to release material using the [[vinyl record|vinyl]] format on their own [[Agit-Prop records|Agit-Prop]] record label, which had evolved from an earlier project, [[Sky and Trees Records]]. The first release was the ''Revolution'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1985, which quickly sold out of its initial run, and was re-pressed, reaching No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Indie Chart]], and staying in the chart for 34 weeks.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> The first LP, ''[[Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records]]'' (1986) was a critique of the [[Live Aid]] concert organised by [[Bob Geldof]], which the band argued was primarily a cosmetic spectacle designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of [[world hunger]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nThe band toured Europe with Dutch band [[The Ex (band)|the Ex]], and a collaboration between members of the two bands, under the name \"Antidote\", led to the release of an EP, ''Destroy Fascism!'', inspired by hardcore punk band [[Heresy (band)|Heresy]], with whom they had also toured.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> Both the Ex and Chumbawamba were released on cassette tape in Poland during this period, when music censorship was entrenched in [[Iron Curtain]] nations. The \"RED\" label, based in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] in south-west Poland during the late 1980s, only released cassette tapes and, despite the limits enforced by Polish authorities, was able to release Chumbawamba's music, in addition to bands from the USSR, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Total rewind: 10 key moments in the life of the cassette|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/30/cassette-store-day-music-tapes|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 August 2013|author=Jude Rogers | authorlink = Jude Rogers }}</ref>\n\nChumbawamba's second album, ''[[Never Mind the Ballots|Never Mind the Ballots...Here's the Rest of Your Lives]]'', was released in 1987, coinciding with the general election, and questions the validity of the British democratic system of the time.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> The band adopted another moniker, Scab Aid, for the \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" song release that parodied a version of the [[Beatles]] song recorded by the popstar supergroup [[Ferry Aid]] to raise money for victims of the [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|Zeebrugge ferry disaster]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nThe 1988 album ''[[English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131984]]'', originally released as ''English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131914'', was a recording of traditional songs.\n\n===One Little Indian Records===\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chumbawamba had begun to absorb influences from [[techno music]] and [[rave culture]]. The band members quit their day jobs to begin concentrating on music full-time as they could now guarantee sales of 10,000 and they moved away from their original anarcho-punk roots, evolving a pop sensibility with releases such as ''[[Slap!]]'' (1990) and the [[Sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy ''[[Shhh (Chumbawamba album)|Shhh]]'' (1992) (originally intended to be released as ''Jesus H Christ!'', this album had to be withdrawn and re-recorded because of [[copyright]] problems).

The latter featured [[Credit to the Nation]]'s rapper MC Fusion. The live shows to support the album were recorded and went to make up their first live album ''[[Showbusiness!]]'', released in 1995.\nOne Little Indian also decided to re-release Chumbawamba's back catalogue, which meant that the first three albums were released on [[Compact disc|CD]] format for the first time. The first two, ''Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records'' (1985) and ''Never Mind the Ballots'' (1987) were repackaged as one disc under the title ''First 2''.\n\nChumbawamba parted with One Little Indian during the recording of the 1996 album ''[[Swingin' with Raymond|Swingin' With Raymond]]'', although they did release one last CD entitled ''Portraits of Anarchists'' which came with copies of [[Casey Orr]]'s book of the same name.\n\n[[Image:Danbert2.jpg|thumb|Chumbawamba vocalist Danbert Nobacon pictured playing live at the [[University of Leeds]], 1986, supporting [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]]]\n\n===EMI Records===\nChumbawamba signed to [[EMI]] in Europe in 1997,<ref name=\"SuprisinglyAwesome\">{{SuprisinglyAwesome|4-tubthumping|TubThumping}}</ref> a move that was viewed as controversial by many of their followers. They had been involved with a compilation LP called ''Fuck EMI'' in 1989, and had criticised the label in many of their earlier songs. The anarcho-punk band [[Oi Polloi]] (with whom Chumbawamba had previously toured and worked with on the 'Punk Aid' ''Smash the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] ) released an 'anti-Chumbawamba' EP, ''Bare Faced Hypocrisy Sells Records'' ([[Ruptured Ambitions]] 1998). Chumbawamba argued that EMI had severed the link with weapons manufacturer [[Thorn Electrical Industries|Thorn]] a few years previously, and that experience had taught them that, in a capitalist environment, almost every record company operates on capitalist principles: \"Our previous record label One Little Indian didn't have the evil symbolic significance of EMI however they were completely motivated by profit.\" They added that this move brought with it the opportunity to make the band financially viable as well as to communicate their message to a wider audience\n.<ref name=sorted>{{cite web|publisher=[[Sorted (magazine)|Sorted]]|url=http://www.sortedmagazine.com/archive/magazine/features/chumba.htm|title=Chumbawamba \u2013 Fighters not Writers|first=Donnacha|last=DeLong|date=1997}}</ref>\n\n====Band politics and mainstream success====\nIn 1997, Chumbawamba scored their biggest chart hit with \"[[Tubthumping]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;2, US No.&nbsp;6), which featured an audio sample of actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]]'s performance in the film ''[[Brassed Off]]''.<ref name=TI>{{cite web |work= [[The Independent]] |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/pete-postlethwaite-distinctive-prolific-actor-acclaimed-by-spielberg-as-the-best-in-the-world-2175128.html|title=Pete Postlethwaite: Distinctive, prolific actor, acclaimed by Spielberg as 'the best in the world'| first= Tom| last= Vallance|date=4 January 2011}}</ref> This was followed up in early 1998 with \"[[Amnesia (Chumbawamba song)|Amnesia]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;10 in the UK. During this period Chumbawamba gained some notoriety over several controversial incidents, starting in August 1997 when Nutter was quoted in the British music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as saying, \"Nothing can change the fact that we like it when cops get killed.\"<ref name=\"MM Aug 97\">{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=16 August 1997 |title=Lager is an Energy! |url= |magazine= [[Melody Maker]] |location= |publisher=IPC Magazines, Ltd. |page=18 |access-date= }}</ref> The comment was met with outrage in Britain's tabloid press and was condemned by the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]].<ref name=\"MM Jan 98\">{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=3 January 1998 |title=Anarchy in the USA |url= |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |location= |publisher=IPC Magazines, Ltd. |page=25 |access-date= }}</ref> The band resisted pressure from EMI to issue an apology and Nutter only clarified her comment by stating, \"If you're working class they won't protect you. When you hear about them, it's in the context of them abusing people, y'know, miscarriages of justice. We don't have a party when cops die, you know we don't.\"<ref name=\"MM Jan 98\" />\n\nIn January 1998 Nutter appeared on the American political talk show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and advised fans of their music who could not afford to buy their CDs to steal them from large chains such as [[HMV]] and [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin]], which prompted Virgin to remove the album from the shelves and start selling it from behind the counter.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kktv.com/entertainment/headlines/2205652.html |title=This Week in Entertainment History: January&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2016 \u2013 22&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006 | website= [[KKTV]].com |archive-date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121230835/http://www.kktv.com/entertainment/headlines/2205652.html  }}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, provoked by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's refusal to support the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool Dockworkers' Strike]], the band performed \"Tubthumping\" at the 1998 [[BRIT Awards]] with the lyric changed to include \"New Labour sold out the dockers, just like they'll sell out the rest of us\", and vocalist Danbert Nobacon later poured a jug of water over [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]], who was in the audience.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nIn the late 1990s, the band turned down $1.5 million from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] to use the song \"Tubthumping\" in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] advertisement.<ref name=nologo>{{cite book| last= Klein| first= Naomi |title= No Logo| place= New York| publisher= Picador| year= 2000| page= 301| isbn= }}</ref> According to the band, the decision took approximately \"30 seconds\" to make.\n\nIn the [[EA Sports]] soccer game ''[[World_Cup_98_(video_game)|Worldcup 98]]'', the song \"Tubthumping\" is one of the soundtrack titles.\n\nIn 2002, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] paid Chumbawamba a sum of either $70,000 or $100,000, to use the song \"[[Pass It Along]]\" from the ''WYSIWYG'' album, for a [[Pontiac]] [[Pontiac Vibe|Vibe]] television advertisement in 2002.

The song was a shoop shoop style ballad,\"[[Tony Blair (song)|Tony Blair]]\", which read like a heartbroken letter to an ex-lover who had broken all his promises. The band would send another free single out two years later, this time a re-worked version of [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Her Majesty (Chumbawamba song)|Her Majesty]]\" to coincide with the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]]'s Golden Jubilee, with lyrics denouncing royalty.\n\nChumbawamba released the album ''[[WYSIWYG (album)|WYSIWYG]]'' in 2000 which included a cover of the early [[Bee Gees]] song \"[[New York Mining Disaster]]\". The single \"[[She's Got All The Friends That Money Can Buy]]\", was backed by \"Passenger List For Doomed Flight 1721\", a song that listed all of the people that the band would like to see \"disappear.\" The list of unfortunates included Tony Blair, [[Ally McBeal]] and [[Bono]]. Chumbawamba parted from EMI in 2001. The band later said that they got what they wanted from the deal with EMI: \"we released some great records, we travelled all over the world, appeared on all these TV programmes, and we made loads of money, a lot of which we gave away or ploughed into worthwhile causes\".<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nTo celebrate their 20 years together, the band made a [[documentary film]] based on footage that they had recorded over the past two decades. Originally intended to be simply a compilation of their videos, the result was entitled ''Well Done, Now Sod off''. The title was taken from an early review of a Chumbawamba record and the film included both lovers and haters of the band.\n\n===Mutt Records {{Anchor|Mutt Records}}===\nIn 2002, Chumbawamba formed their own record label, Mutt Records for UK releases.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.myspace.com/muttrecords |title=Mutt Records &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |website=Myspace.com |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnder Mutt, Chumbawamba released their eleventh official album, ''[[Readymades (album)|Readymades]]'', which mixed samples of [[folk music]] with dance beats. For the US ''Readymades'' was repackaged under the title ''Readymades And Then Some'', the extended title referring to a second disc \u2013 a DVD which featured clips from ''Well Done Now Sod Off'' and remixes of \"Tubthumping\", one being a remix by the band [[Flaming Lips]]. Under the Mutt label the band also produced ''Sic \u2013 Adventures in Anti-Capitalism'', a [[paperback]] book of political and musical writings by friends and acquaintances of the band.\n\nThe same year Chumbawamba provided an original soundtrack to [[Alex Cox]]'s film adaptation of ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]''. Chumbawamba released the [[Revengers Tragedy (Album)|full soundtrack]] in 2003.\n\nThe band also revisited their ''a capella'' 1988 album ''[[English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131914]]'' and felt that as they were now more confident singers, they should re-record it and bring it up to date. And so ''English Rebel Songs'' was remade in 2003 with the added track \"Coal Not Dole\" bringing the record up to 1984.\n\nIn 2004, the band released an album called ''[[Un (album)|Un]]''. While less synth driven than ''Readymades'' or the ''Revengers Tragedy'' soundtrack, the album relied heavily on samples, from tribal chants to [[Frank Zappa]] interview quotes. The album opens with one of the earliest recordings of a human voice, that of [[Thomas Edison]] reciting \"[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]\". The album gave an inkling of the [[folk music|folk]] sound that Chumbawamba would move towards on their subsequent releases.\n\n===No Masters Records===\n\nIn 2005 Chumbawamba took a hiatus from full-scale touring and recording projects, but a trimmed-down acoustic line-up of Boff Whalley, Lou Watts, Jude Abbot and Neil Ferguson continued to tour the UK and Europe throughout 2005 and 2006. It was this line-up that recorded the album ''[[A Singsong and a Scrap]]'', released late in 2005 on [[No Masters]] records. They followed this up with a second live album, entitled ''[[Get On With It]]'', recorded during 2006 at various venues throughout Britain.\n\nIn 2006 Nutter wrote the musical drama ''Love and Petrol'' which played for a week in [[Bradford]] during June. Hamer wrote the music. Both continue to work in theatre, with Nutter writing ''Foxes'' for West Yorkshire Playhouse 2006 and ''Where's Vietnam?'' for [[Red Ladder Theatre Company]] in 2008 \u2013 again Hamer wrote the music. Nutter has since moved into radio and TV, writing for [[Jimmy McGovern]]'s BAFTA-winning drama, ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' and for ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. In 2007 Danbert released his second solo album ''Library Book Of The World'', his first being ''The Un-fairy Tale'' in 1985. ''The Un fairy-tale'' was re-released in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, Chumbawamba played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | title = First bands confirmed for Glastonbury 2007 | author = | url = http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/25741 | publisher = [[NME]] | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}</ref> In early 2007, the band announced via their website that a new album was in the works, stating that \"the new album will be acoustic and probably won't sound like ''A Singsong and a Scrap''\".\n\nThe result was ''[[The Boy Bands Have Won]]'', released on 3 March 2008 in the UK and 14 March in mainland Europe. The record contained 25 tracks, some of them full length songs, some of them no more than a minute long and was again acoustic folk in style. The album features the [[Oysterband]], [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]] and Barry Coope amongst others.\n\nIn late 2009 Chumbawamba toured northern England in their self-penned pantomime, a comedy musical entitled ''Riot, Rebellion & Bloody Insurrection'' with the Red Ladder Theatre Company. In late February 2010 they released their 15th album, titled ''[[ABCDEFG (album)|ABCDEFG]]''.\n\nIn September 2011, past and present band members protested when the [[UK Independence Party]] used \"Tubthumping\" at their annual conference.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alexandra Topping |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/09/chumbawumba-tubthumping-crazy-ukip-song |title=Chumbawamba go Tubthumping crazy over Ukip's use of No1 hit &#124; Politics |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 9 September 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIt was announced in 2011 that Boff Whalley was working on a musical for the stage. The soundtrack to the musical, entitled ''Chumbawamba & Red Ladder Present: Big Society!'' was released on 16 January 2012. The recording features all of the current members of Chumbawamba performing on various instruments, accompanying the singing of the actors in the play. Two songs are sung by former Chumbawamba drummer Harry Hamer, marking his first vocal appearance on a Chumbawamba recording since the 1986 song ''Rich Pop Stars''.\n\n===Charity work===\nChumbawamba is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and participated in a Radio PSA for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/radio-2/|title=Radio \u2013 Artists Against Racism|website=Artistsagainstracism.org|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Break-up===\nOn 8 July 2012, Chumbawamba announced that they would be disbanding at the end of the year. On their website they opened the statement with \"That's it then, it\u2019s the end. With neither a whimper, a bang or a reunion.\" They stated they would continue with individual efforts, and ended their official statement:\n<blockquote>\nWe do, of course, reserve the right to re-emerge as Chumbawamba doing something else entirely (certainly not touring and putting out albums every 2 or 3 years). But frankly, that's not very likely. Thirty years of being snotty, eclectic, funny, contrary and just plain weird. What a privilege, and what a good time we\u2019ve had.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn December 2012, the final UK show, filmed at the [[Leeds City Varieties]] on Halloween night, was released as Chumbawamba's only live DVD, entitled ''Going Going''.\n\nThe band's final show at Leeds City Varieties was performed by the latest line-up of: Boff Whalley, Jude Abbott, Neil Furguson, Phill Moody and Lou Watts, with the more folk style instruments, and arrangements the band had grown and become. The show included special guests who performed on songs, such as former band members: Danbert Nobacon, Alice Nutter, Harry Hamer and Dunstan Bruce, and fellow recording collaborators like Belinda O'Hooley. Mike Harding, radio folk presenter and supporter of the band, was present at the gig and came back stage to the dressing rooms to speak with the musicians. A group of people on the front row of the audience all wore Margaret Thatcher masks. When coming on to play, Jude Abbott pointed them out and Boff Whalley commented \"Oh my goodness the entire front row is Margaret Thatcher. They have come to collect our poll tax.\" A 'washing line' of band T-shirts was hung at the back of the stage and they included prints from the early 80's to the present. It was the idea of Boff Whalley to use them on the stage as he turned up in the morning with a suitcase full of T-shirts and a bag of pegs as a way to make a backdrop on the stage.\n\nThe show was stage managed by Alyson Howe who had met Harry Hamer some years before as he was beginning a career in theatre work, and then later met and worked with the Chumbas during their collaboration with Red Ladder theatre company on the show Riot Rebellion and Bloody Insurrection and later Big Society! Her duties mostly involved getting pizza for everyone, arranging dressing rooms and making sure all the guest musicians were present in the wings before performing. The Leeds City Varieties technicians had already met and worked with most of the band the previous winter during their two-week run of Big Society! The set list changed once half an hour before the doors opened, moving Time Bomb, one of their better known songs, to a later slot and cutting one song to save time.  Although it was the band's final show in Leeds, the band flew the next morning to do their second to last gig in Oslo.\n\nA mail-order EP, ''In Memoriam: Margaret Thatcher'', was released on 8 April 2013. The CD had been recorded in 2005 and made available for pre-order on the group's website, to be issued upon the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name=\"Streaming version\">{{cite web|title=In Memorium|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/04/10/stream-chumbawambas-in-memoriam-an-ep-recorded-in-2005-and-made-available-upon-margaret-thatchers-death/|website=Factmag.com|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Chumbawamba, vocalist Dunstan Bruce founded Dandy Films, an independent film and video company whose projects have included a \"video blog\" of [[Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] UK tour during 2010 and [[Sham 69]]'s tour of China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/Home/Editorial/A%20Weapon%20Called%20The%20Word:%20Levellers%20Go%20Grassroots%20With%20Debut%20Reissue/21_38_3166 |title=Brighton Magazine \u2013 A Weapon Called The Word: Levellers Go Grassroots With Debut Reissue |website=Magazine.brighton.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930051249/http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/Home/Editorial/A%20Weapon%20Called%20The%20Word:%20Levellers%20Go%20Grassroots%20With%20Debut%20Reissue/21_38_3166 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 former Chumbawamba members Dunstan Bruce and Harry Hamer formed a new band, Interrobang?!, with guitarist Stephen Griffin of London-based Regular Fries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interrobangband.co.uk/|title=Interrobang?!|website=Interrobang?!|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, Dunstan Bruce, Boff Whalley and Jude Abbott were interviewed on [[BBC]]'s [[The One Show]] from the Leeds City Varieties and near their former home celebrating 20 years since the release of [[Tubthumping]].\n\n===Documentary===\nOn 1 July 2015 Dunstan Bruce started a [[Kickstarter]] to fund a documentary titled ''I Get Knocked Down (The Untold Story of Chumbawamba)'' that told the band's entire history from different members' perspective.

Phill Moody doubled as band member and character narrator who relayed the story centre stage in rhyming couplets accompanied by his accordion. It was directed and produced by Red Ladder Theatre Company and toured Northern UK venues winter 2009\u20132010. It was a historic play set in the 19th century with elements of musical theatre, agitprop and audience interaction. Set during the Luddite rebellion it included satiric and humorous parallels to the then Gordon Brown government and state of living in the UK.  The show included songs from the 2003 album English Rebel Songs, and a rendition of Time Bomb where the cast and band would substitute the venue in the last lyric of the song, e.g. \"Gateshead Sage is falling down\".\n\n2013 Chumbawamba and Red Ladder collaborated again on Big Society! Written by Boff Whalley. The performance played 18 January to 4 February. The band were again on stage as live musicians. The songs were composed by Boff Whalley and the band created specifically for the show, except for the traditional song 'It's the same the whole world over'. The company cast well-known comedian Phill Jupitus alongside actors Dean Nolan, Harry Hamer (former band member), Kyler Goodie, and Lisa Howard. It played for two weeks at Leeds City Varieties, the venue where Chumbawamba would later play their final Going, Going gig. Set in a struggling Victorian music hall, the show made specific parallels to David Cameron's 'big society' and Tory government in its 'front of cloth variety' scenes.\n\n==Personnel==\n[[Image:Chumbawamba 1.jpg|thumb|Jude Abbott, Neil Ferguson and Boff Whalley of Chumbawamba in 2005]]\nThe band's membership varied over the years, with the line-up and musical assignments in the early years being especially fluid (members were known to switch instruments between, or even during, gigs). This is a list of principal official members and collaborators, drawn mainly from the credits of their releases since 1985. Short-term members and collaborators are not included.\n\n;Former members\n<!---PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ORDER OF MEMBERS! Members should always be listed chronologically on Wikipedia.

The band constantly shifted in musical style, drawing on genres such as [[punk rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music|folk]]. Their [[anarcho-communist]] or [[libertarian socialist]] political stance exhibited an irreverent attitude toward authority, and the band have been forthright in their stances on issues including [[animal rights]] and [[pacifism]] (early in their career) and later regarding [[class struggle]], [[marxism]], [[feminism]], [[gay liberation]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[anti-fascism]].\n\nThe band are best known for their song \"[[Tubthumping]]\", which was nominated for [[1998 Brit Awards#The awards|Best British Single]] at the [[1998 Brit Awards]]. Other singles include \"[[Amnesia (Chumbawamba song)|Amnesia]]\", \"[[Enough Is Enough (Chumbawumba song)|Enough Is Enough]]\" (with [[Credit to the Nation|MC Fusion]]), \"[[Timebomb (Chumbawamba song)|Timebomb]]\", \"[[Top of the World (Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9)]]\", and \"[[Add Me]]\".\n\nIn July 2012, Chumbawamba announced they were splitting up after 30 years.

Their first vinyl release was a track (\"Three Years Later\") on the [[Crass Records]] compilation album ''[[Bullshit Detector]] 2''.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[PiL]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], and [[Adam and the Ants]] and politically by the anarchist stance of [[Crass]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  Another of the band's early releases was under the name \"Skin Disease\", parodying the [[Oi!]] bands of the time so successfully that they were included on 'Back On The Streets', an Oi! compilation EP put together by ''Sounds'' magazine journalist [[Garry Bushell]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include [[Alice Nutter (writer)|Alice Nutter]] (of Ouch, My Hair's on Fire), and [[Dunstan Bruce|Dunstan \"Dunst\" Bruce]] (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a [[Squatting|squat]] in [[Armley]], [[Leeds]], with Harry \"Daz\" Hamer and Mavis \"Mave\" Dillon joining soon after.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />  Stalwarts of the [[cassette culture]] scene, the band released a number of tapes including ''Be Happy Despite It All'' and ''Raising Heck With Chumbawamba'', and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s [[anarcho-punk]] movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as [[animal rights]], the [[anti-war]] movement, and community groups. The band's collective political views are often described as [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They made several songs about the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]], including the ''Common Ground'' cassette and a song dedicated to the [[pit village]] of [[Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire|Fitzwilliam]], which was one of the worst cases of economic decline following the strike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicdb.laadhari.com/Chumbawamba/Fitzwilliam/459081-lyrics.html |title=Fitzwilliam lyrics |website=Musicdb.laadhari.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822192523/http://musicdb.laadhari.com/Chumbawamba/Fitzwilliam/459081-lyrics.html |archive-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Sky and Trees and Agit-Prop Records===\nBy the mid-1980s Chumbawamba had begun to release material using the [[vinyl record|vinyl]] format on their own [[Agit-Prop records|Agit-Prop]] record label, which had evolved from an earlier project, [[Sky and Trees Records]]. The first release was the ''Revolution'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1985, which quickly sold out of its initial run, and was re-pressed, reaching No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Indie Chart]], and staying in the chart for 34 weeks.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> The first LP, ''[[Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records]]'' (1986) was a critique of the [[Live Aid]] concert organised by [[Bob Geldof]], which the band argued was primarily a cosmetic spectacle designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of [[world hunger]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nThe band toured Europe with Dutch band [[The Ex (band)|the Ex]], and a collaboration between members of the two bands, under the name \"Antidote\", led to the release of an EP, ''Destroy Fascism!'', inspired by hardcore punk band [[Heresy (band)|Heresy]], with whom they had also toured.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> Both the Ex and Chumbawamba were released on cassette tape in Poland during this period, when music censorship was entrenched in [[Iron Curtain]] nations. The \"RED\" label, based in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] in south-west Poland during the late 1980s, only released cassette tapes and, despite the limits enforced by Polish authorities, was able to release Chumbawamba's music, in addition to bands from the USSR, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Total rewind: 10 key moments in the life of the cassette|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/30/cassette-store-day-music-tapes|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 August 2013|author=Jude Rogers | authorlink = Jude Rogers }}</ref>\n\nChumbawamba's second album, ''[[Never Mind the Ballots|Never Mind the Ballots...Here's the Rest of Your Lives]]'', was released in 1987, coinciding with the general election, and questions the validity of the British democratic system of the time.<ref name=\"Glasper\" /> The band adopted another moniker, Scab Aid, for the \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\" song release that parodied a version of the [[Beatles]] song recorded by the popstar supergroup [[Ferry Aid]] to raise money for victims of the [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|Zeebrugge ferry disaster]].<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nThe 1988 album ''[[English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131984]]'', originally released as ''English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131914'', was a recording of traditional songs.\n\n===One Little Indian Records===\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chumbawamba had begun to absorb influences from [[techno music]] and [[rave culture]]. The band members quit their day jobs to begin concentrating on music full-time as they could now guarantee sales of 10,000 and they moved away from their original anarcho-punk roots, evolving a pop sensibility with releases such as ''[[Slap!]]'' (1990) and the [[Sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy ''[[Shhh (Chumbawamba album)|Shhh]]'' (1992) (originally intended to be released as ''Jesus H Christ!'', this album had to be withdrawn and re-recorded because of [[copyright]] problems).

The latter featured [[Credit to the Nation]]'s rapper MC Fusion. The live shows to support the album were recorded and went to make up their first live album ''[[Showbusiness!]]'', released in 1995.\nOne Little Indian also decided to re-release Chumbawamba's back catalogue, which meant that the first three albums were released on [[Compact disc|CD]] format for the first time. The first two, ''Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records'' (1985) and ''Never Mind the Ballots'' (1987) were repackaged as one disc under the title ''First 2''.\n\nChumbawamba parted with One Little Indian during the recording of the 1996 album ''[[Swingin' with Raymond|Swingin' With Raymond]]'', although they did release one last CD entitled ''Portraits of Anarchists'' which came with copies of [[Casey Orr]]'s book of the same name.\n\n[[Image:Danbert2.jpg|thumb|Chumbawamba vocalist Danbert Nobacon pictured playing live at the [[University of Leeds]], 1986, supporting [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]]]\n\n===EMI Records===\nChumbawamba signed to [[EMI]] in Europe in 1997,<ref name=\"SuprisinglyAwesome\">{{SuprisinglyAwesome|4-tubthumping|TubThumping}}</ref> a move that was viewed as controversial by many of their followers. They had been involved with a compilation LP called ''Fuck EMI'' in 1989, and had criticised the label in many of their earlier songs. The anarcho-punk band [[Oi Polloi]] (with whom Chumbawamba had previously toured and worked with on the 'Punk Aid' ''Smash the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] ) released an 'anti-Chumbawamba' EP, ''Bare Faced Hypocrisy Sells Records'' ([[Ruptured Ambitions]] 1998). Chumbawamba argued that EMI had severed the link with weapons manufacturer [[Thorn Electrical Industries|Thorn]] a few years previously, and that experience had taught them that, in a capitalist environment, almost every record company operates on capitalist principles: \"Our previous record label One Little Indian didn't have the evil symbolic significance of EMI however they were completely motivated by profit.\" They added that this move brought with it the opportunity to make the band financially viable as well as to communicate their message to a wider audience\n.<ref name=sorted>{{cite web|publisher=[[Sorted (magazine)|Sorted]]|url=http://www.sortedmagazine.com/archive/magazine/features/chumba.htm|title=Chumbawamba \u2013 Fighters not Writers|first=Donnacha|last=DeLong|date=1997}}</ref>\n\n====Band politics and mainstream success====\nIn 1997, Chumbawamba scored their biggest chart hit with \"[[Tubthumping]]\" (UK No.&nbsp;2, US No.&nbsp;6), which featured an audio sample of actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]]'s performance in the film ''[[Brassed Off]]''.<ref name=TI>{{cite web |work= [[The Independent]] |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/pete-postlethwaite-distinctive-prolific-actor-acclaimed-by-spielberg-as-the-best-in-the-world-2175128.html|title=Pete Postlethwaite: Distinctive, prolific actor, acclaimed by Spielberg as 'the best in the world'| first= Tom| last= Vallance|date=4 January 2011}}</ref> This was followed up in early 1998 with \"[[Amnesia (Chumbawamba song)|Amnesia]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;10 in the UK. During this period Chumbawamba gained some notoriety over several controversial incidents, starting in August 1997 when Nutter was quoted in the British music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as saying, \"Nothing can change the fact that we like it when cops get killed.\"<ref name=\"MM Aug 97\">{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=16 August 1997 |title=Lager is an Energy! |url= |magazine= [[Melody Maker]] |location= |publisher=IPC Magazines, Ltd. |page=18 |access-date= }}</ref> The comment was met with outrage in Britain's tabloid press and was condemned by the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]].<ref name=\"MM Jan 98\">{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=3 January 1998 |title=Anarchy in the USA |url= |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |location= |publisher=IPC Magazines, Ltd. |page=25 |access-date= }}</ref> The band resisted pressure from EMI to issue an apology and Nutter only clarified her comment by stating, \"If you're working class they won't protect you. When you hear about them, it's in the context of them abusing people, y'know, miscarriages of justice. We don't have a party when cops die, you know we don't.\"<ref name=\"MM Jan 98\" />\n\nIn January 1998 Nutter appeared on the American political talk show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and advised fans of their music who could not afford to buy their CDs to steal them from large chains such as [[HMV]] and [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin]], which prompted Virgin to remove the album from the shelves and start selling it from behind the counter.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kktv.com/entertainment/headlines/2205652.html |title=This Week in Entertainment History: January&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2016 \u2013 22&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006 | website= [[KKTV]].com |archive-date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121230835/http://www.kktv.com/entertainment/headlines/2205652.html  }}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, provoked by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's refusal to support the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool Dockworkers' Strike]], the band performed \"Tubthumping\" at the 1998 [[BRIT Awards]] with the lyric changed to include \"New Labour sold out the dockers, just like they'll sell out the rest of us\", and vocalist Danbert Nobacon later poured a jug of water over [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]], who was in the audience.<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nIn the late 1990s, the band turned down $1.5 million from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] to use the song \"Tubthumping\" in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] advertisement.<ref name=nologo>{{cite book| last= Klein| first= Naomi |title= No Logo| place= New York| publisher= Picador| year= 2000| page= 301| isbn= }}</ref> According to the band, the decision took approximately \"30 seconds\" to make.\n\nIn the [[EA Sports]] soccer game ''[[World_Cup_98_(video_game)|Worldcup 98]]'', the song \"Tubthumping\" is one of the soundtrack titles.\n\nIn 2002, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] paid Chumbawamba a sum of either $70,000 or $100,000, to use the song \"[[Pass It Along]]\" from the ''WYSIWYG'' album, for a [[Pontiac]] [[Pontiac Vibe|Vibe]] television advertisement in 2002.

The song was a shoop shoop style ballad,\"[[Tony Blair (song)|Tony Blair]]\", which read like a heartbroken letter to an ex-lover who had broken all his promises. The band would send another free single out two years later, this time a re-worked version of [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Her Majesty (Chumbawamba song)|Her Majesty]]\" to coincide with the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]]'s Golden Jubilee, with lyrics denouncing royalty.\n\nChumbawamba released the album ''[[WYSIWYG (album)|WYSIWYG]]'' in 2000 which included a cover of the early [[Bee Gees]] song \"[[New York Mining Disaster]]\". The single \"[[She's Got All The Friends That Money Can Buy]]\", was backed by \"Passenger List For Doomed Flight 1721\", a song that listed all of the people that the band would like to see \"disappear.\" The list of unfortunates included Tony Blair, [[Ally McBeal]] and [[Bono]]. Chumbawamba parted from EMI in 2001. The band later said that they got what they wanted from the deal with EMI: \"we released some great records, we travelled all over the world, appeared on all these TV programmes, and we made loads of money, a lot of which we gave away or ploughed into worthwhile causes\".<ref name=\"Glasper\" />\n\nTo celebrate their 20 years together, the band made a [[documentary film]] based on footage that they had recorded over the past two decades. Originally intended to be simply a compilation of their videos, the result was entitled ''Well Done, Now Sod off''. The title was taken from an early review of a Chumbawamba record and the film included both lovers and haters of the band.\n\n===Mutt Records {{Anchor|Mutt Records}}===\nIn 2002, Chumbawamba formed their own record label, Mutt Records for UK releases.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.myspace.com/muttrecords |title=Mutt Records &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |website=Myspace.com |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnder Mutt, Chumbawamba released their eleventh official album, ''[[Readymades (album)|Readymades]]'', which mixed samples of [[folk music]] with dance beats. For the US ''Readymades'' was repackaged under the title ''Readymades And Then Some'', the extended title referring to a second disc \u2013 a DVD which featured clips from ''Well Done Now Sod Off'' and remixes of \"Tubthumping\", one being a remix by the band [[Flaming Lips]]. Under the Mutt label the band also produced ''Sic \u2013 Adventures in Anti-Capitalism'', a [[paperback]] book of political and musical writings by friends and acquaintances of the band.\n\nThe same year Chumbawamba provided an original soundtrack to [[Alex Cox]]'s film adaptation of ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]''. Chumbawamba released the [[Revengers Tragedy (Album)|full soundtrack]] in 2003.\n\nThe band also revisited their ''a capella'' 1988 album ''[[English Rebel Songs 1381\u20131914]]'' and felt that as they were now more confident singers, they should re-record it and bring it up to date. And so ''English Rebel Songs'' was remade in 2003 with the added track \"Coal Not Dole\" bringing the record up to 1984.\n\nIn 2004, the band released an album called ''[[Un (album)|Un]]''. While less synth driven than ''Readymades'' or the ''Revengers Tragedy'' soundtrack, the album relied heavily on samples, from tribal chants to [[Frank Zappa]] interview quotes. The album opens with one of the earliest recordings of a human voice, that of [[Thomas Edison]] reciting \"[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]\". The album gave an inkling of the [[folk music|folk]] sound that Chumbawamba would move towards on their subsequent releases.\n\n===No Masters Records===\n\nIn 2005 Chumbawamba took a hiatus from full-scale touring and recording projects, but a trimmed-down acoustic line-up of Boff Whalley, Lou Watts, Jude Abbot and Neil Ferguson continued to tour the UK and Europe throughout 2005 and 2006. It was this line-up that recorded the album ''[[A Singsong and a Scrap]]'', released late in 2005 on [[No Masters]] records. They followed this up with a second live album, entitled ''[[Get On With It]]'', recorded during 2006 at various venues throughout Britain.\n\nIn 2006 Nutter wrote the musical drama ''Love and Petrol'' which played for a week in [[Bradford]] during June. Hamer wrote the music. Both continue to work in theatre, with Nutter writing ''Foxes'' for West Yorkshire Playhouse 2006 and ''Where's Vietnam?'' for [[Red Ladder Theatre Company]] in 2008 \u2013 again Hamer wrote the music. Nutter has since moved into radio and TV, writing for [[Jimmy McGovern]]'s BAFTA-winning drama, ''[[The Street (UK TV series)|The Street]]'' and for ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. In 2007 Danbert released his second solo album ''Library Book Of The World'', his first being ''The Un-fairy Tale'' in 1985. ''The Un fairy-tale'' was re-released in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, Chumbawamba played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | title = First bands confirmed for Glastonbury 2007 | author = | url = http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/25741 | publisher = [[NME]] | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}</ref> In early 2007, the band announced via their website that a new album was in the works, stating that \"the new album will be acoustic and probably won't sound like ''A Singsong and a Scrap''\".\n\nThe result was ''[[The Boy Bands Have Won]]'', released on 3 March 2008 in the UK and 14 March in mainland Europe. The record contained 25 tracks, some of them full length songs, some of them no more than a minute long and was again acoustic folk in style. The album features the [[Oysterband]], [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]] and Barry Coope amongst others.\n\nIn late 2009 Chumbawamba toured northern England in their self-penned pantomime, a comedy musical entitled ''Riot, Rebellion & Bloody Insurrection'' with the Red Ladder Theatre Company. In late February 2010 they released their 15th album, titled ''[[ABCDEFG (album)|ABCDEFG]]''.\n\nIn September 2011, past and present band members protested when the [[UK Independence Party]] used \"Tubthumping\" at their annual conference.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alexandra Topping |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/09/chumbawumba-tubthumping-crazy-ukip-song |title=Chumbawamba go Tubthumping crazy over Ukip's use of No1 hit &#124; Politics |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 9 September 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIt was announced in 2011 that Boff Whalley was working on a musical for the stage. The soundtrack to the musical, entitled ''Chumbawamba & Red Ladder Present: Big Society!'' was released on 16 January 2012. The recording features all of the current members of Chumbawamba performing on various instruments, accompanying the singing of the actors in the play. Two songs are sung by former Chumbawamba drummer Harry Hamer, marking his first vocal appearance on a Chumbawamba recording since the 1986 song ''Rich Pop Stars''.\n\n===Charity work===\nChumbawamba is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and participated in a Radio PSA for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/radio-2/|title=Radio \u2013 Artists Against Racism|website=Artistsagainstracism.org|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Break-up===\nOn 8 July 2012, Chumbawamba announced that they would be disbanding at the end of the year. On their website they opened the statement with \"That's it then, it\u2019s the end. With neither a whimper, a bang or a reunion.\" They stated they would continue with individual efforts, and ended their official statement:\n<blockquote>\nWe do, of course, reserve the right to re-emerge as Chumbawamba doing something else entirely (certainly not touring and putting out albums every 2 or 3 years). But frankly, that's not very likely. Thirty years of being snotty, eclectic, funny, contrary and just plain weird. What a privilege, and what a good time we\u2019ve had.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn December 2012, the final UK show, filmed at the [[Leeds City Varieties]] on Halloween night, was released as Chumbawamba's only live DVD, entitled ''Going Going''.\n\nThe band's final show at Leeds City Varieties was performed by the latest line-up of: Boff Whalley, Jude Abbott, Neil Furguson, Phill Moody and Lou Watts, with the more folk style instruments, and arrangements the band had grown and become. The show included special guests who performed on songs, such as former band members: Danbert Nobacon, Alice Nutter, Harry Hamer and Dunstan Bruce, and fellow recording collaborators like Belinda O'Hooley. Mike Harding, radio folk presenter and supporter of the band, was present at the gig and came back stage to the dressing rooms to speak with the musicians. A group of people on the front row of the audience all wore Margaret Thatcher masks. When coming on to play, Jude Abbott pointed them out and Boff Whalley commented \"Oh my goodness the entire front row is Margaret Thatcher. They have come to collect our poll tax.\" A 'washing line' of band T-shirts was hung at the back of the stage and they included prints from the early 80's to the present. It was the idea of Boff Whalley to use them on the stage as he turned up in the morning with a suitcase full of T-shirts and a bag of pegs as a way to make a backdrop on the stage.\n\nThe show was stage managed by Alyson Howe who had met Harry Hamer some years before as he was beginning a career in theatre work, and then later met and worked with the Chumbas during their collaboration with Red Ladder theatre company on the show Riot Rebellion and Bloody Insurrection and later Big Society! Her duties mostly involved getting pizza for everyone, arranging dressing rooms and making sure all the guest musicians were present in the wings before performing. The Leeds City Varieties technicians had already met and worked with most of the band the previous winter during their two-week run of Big Society! The set list changed once half an hour before the doors opened, moving Time Bomb, one of their better known songs, to a later slot and cutting one song to save time.  Although it was the band's final show in Leeds, the band flew the next morning to do their second to last gig in Oslo.\n\nA mail-order EP, ''In Memoriam: Margaret Thatcher'', was released on 8 April 2013. The CD had been recorded in 2005 and made available for pre-order on the group's website, to be issued upon the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name=\"Streaming version\">{{cite web|title=In Memorium|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/04/10/stream-chumbawambas-in-memoriam-an-ep-recorded-in-2005-and-made-available-upon-margaret-thatchers-death/|website=Factmag.com|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Chumbawamba, vocalist Dunstan Bruce founded Dandy Films, an independent film and video company whose projects have included a \"video blog\" of [[Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] UK tour during 2010 and [[Sham 69]]'s tour of China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/Home/Editorial/A%20Weapon%20Called%20The%20Word:%20Levellers%20Go%20Grassroots%20With%20Debut%20Reissue/21_38_3166 |title=Brighton Magazine \u2013 A Weapon Called The Word: Levellers Go Grassroots With Debut Reissue |website=Magazine.brighton.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930051249/http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/Home/Editorial/A%20Weapon%20Called%20The%20Word:%20Levellers%20Go%20Grassroots%20With%20Debut%20Reissue/21_38_3166 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 former Chumbawamba members Dunstan Bruce and Harry Hamer formed a new band, Interrobang?!, with guitarist Stephen Griffin of London-based Regular Fries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interrobangband.co.uk/|title=Interrobang?!|website=Interrobang?!|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, Dunstan Bruce, Boff Whalley and Jude Abbott were interviewed on [[BBC]]'s [[The One Show]] from the Leeds City Varieties and near their former home celebrating 20 years since the release of [[Tubthumping]].\n\n===Documentary===\nOn 1 July 2015 Dunstan Bruce started a [[Kickstarter]] to fund a documentary titled ''I Get Knocked Down (The Untold Story of Chumbawamba)'' that told the band's entire history from different members' perspective.

Phill Moody doubled as band member and character narrator who relayed the story centre stage in rhyming couplets accompanied by his accordion. It was directed and produced by Red Ladder Theatre Company and toured Northern UK venues winter 2009\u20132010. It was a historic play set in the 19th century with elements of musical theatre, agitprop and audience interaction. Set during the Luddite rebellion it included satiric and humorous parallels to the then Gordon Brown government and state of living in the UK.  The show included songs from the 2003 album English Rebel Songs, and a rendition of Time Bomb where the cast and band would substitute the venue in the last lyric of the song, e.g. \"Gateshead Sage is falling down\".\n\n2013 Chumbawamba and Red Ladder collaborated again on Big Society! Written by Boff Whalley. The performance played 18 January to 4 February. The band were again on stage as live musicians. The songs were composed by Boff Whalley and the band created specifically for the show, except for the traditional song 'It's the same the whole world over'. The company cast well-known comedian Phill Jupitus alongside actors Dean Nolan, Harry Hamer (former band member), Kyler Goodie, and Lisa Howard. It played for two weeks at Leeds City Varieties, the venue where Chumbawamba would later play their final Going, Going gig. Set in a struggling Victorian music hall, the show made specific parallels to David Cameron's 'big society' and Tory government in its 'front of cloth variety' scenes.\n\n==Personnel==\n[[Image:Chumbawamba 1.jpg|thumb|Jude Abbott, Neil Ferguson and Boff Whalley of Chumbawamba in 2005]]\nThe band's membership varied over the years, with the line-up and musical assignments in the early years being especially fluid (members were known to switch instruments between, or even during, gigs). This is a list of principal official members and collaborators, drawn mainly from the credits of their releases since 1985. Short-term members and collaborators are not included.\n\n;Former members\n<!---PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ORDER OF MEMBERS! Members should always be listed chronologically on Wikipedia.
