By collecting different crystals from the walls of the tunnel, new tunnels are unlocked, each one playing a different section of the song. Green tunnels play sections from the first verse, pink tunnels play sections from the second one, orange tunnels play sections from the third verse, red tunnels play the chorus and blue tunnels play the coda.\n\n===Live performances===\nBj\u00f6rk debuted the songs during a series of performances at the [[Manchester International Festival]] in England between 27 June and 16 July 2011.

Then, they create  [[wavelet]]s, just like rain. On the third verse, they create bubbles where metallic objects appear. All this resulted from several conversations I had with Bj\u00f6rk about these matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjork.fr/+Le-clip-de-Crystalline+ |title=Le clip de Crystalline |publisher=Bjork.fr |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>}}\n\nThe video received a nomination at the Antville Music Video Awards, in the Best Art Direction category.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Antville Music Video Awards 2011|url=http://videos.antville.org/stories/2098127|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Apps===\n\nEvery song on ''Biophilia'' has an [[iPad app|app for iPhone or iPad]]. The main app was released on 19 July 2011, coinciding with the release of \"Cosmogony\", and it integrates all the songs' apps.\nThe app for \"Crystalline\" is a video game that uses the iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad's tilt feature to move a crystal through various tunnels. By collecting different crystals from the walls of the tunnel, new tunnels are unlocked, each one playing a different section of the song. Green tunnels play sections from the first verse, pink tunnels play sections from the second one, orange tunnels play sections from the third verse, red tunnels play the chorus and blue tunnels play the coda.\n\n===Live performances===\nBj\u00f6rk debuted the songs during a series of performances at the [[Manchester International Festival]] in England between 27 June and 16 July 2011. Bj\u00f6rk performed ''Biophilia'' tracks and music from her back catalogue with a small group of musical collaborators, including Graduale Nobili, an Icelandic female choir.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bjoerk-to-debut-new-biophilia-songs-at-residency-in-england-20110317|title=Bj\u00f6rk to Debut New 'Biophilia' Songs at Residency in England|first=Matthew|last=Perpetua|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=17 March 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/03/Bj\u00f6rk-readies-ipad-album-biophilia/|title=Bj\u00f6rk readies iPad album, Biophilia|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=17 March 2011|first=Alex|last=Young|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]}}</ref> She performed \"Crystalline\" during every concert of the [[Biophilia Tour]].\n\nBj\u00f6rk performed the songs live on [[BBC2]]'s ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

It is the opening track and lead single from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it number 495 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and at number five on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596335/brown_sugar/ \"Brown Sugar\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 9 December 2004 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and recording==\nThough credited, like most of their compositions, to the singer/guitarist pair of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], the song was primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' in 1969.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923165126/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 \"Jagger Remembers\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref> The song was written by Jagger with [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]], Jagger's secret girlfriend and mother of his first child Karis, in mind. It is also claimed it was written with [[Claudia Lennear]] in mind. Lennear claimed to be the song's subject on BBC's [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (25 February 2014, ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]''), because she kept Jagger's company at the time when it was written.\n\n\"Brown Sugar\" was recorded over a three-day period at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], from 2 to 4 December 1969. The song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former label. At the request of guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] (who had joined the band as [[Brian Jones]]' replacement in July 1969), the Stones debuted the number live during the infamous concert at the [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]] Speedway on 6 December 1969. \n\nIn the [[liner notes]] to the compilation album ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'' (1993), Jagger says, \"The lyric was all to do with the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very instant thing, a definite high point\".<ref>Covach, John (2005), \"Form in Rock Music: A Primer\", in Stein, Deborah, ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.74-75, {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}} .</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rolling Stone'' interview (14 December 1995, RS 723) Jagger spoke at length about the song, its inspiration and success, and taking credit for writing the lyrics. Keith Richards also credits Jagger with the song in his autobiography.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life|last=Richards|first=Keith|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2010|isbn=978-0-316-03438-8|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref> He attributed the success of the song to a \"good groove\". After noting that the lyrics could mean so many lewd subjects,<ref>{{Citation|last=mayerson|first=hy|title=Metamorphosis|date=2019-03-09|url=https://vimeo.com/322545607|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> he again noted that the combination of those subjects, the lyrical ambiguity was partially why the song was considered successful. He noted, \"That makes it... the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I'm on about on that song. It's such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go... I never would write that song now.\" When [[Jann Wenner|interviewer Jann Wenner]] asked him why, Jagger replied, \"I would probably censor myself. I'd think, 'Oh God, I can't. I've got to stop. I can't just write raw like that.{{'\"}}<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5/ \"Jagger Remembers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 |date=5 December 2009 }}. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe lyrical subject matter has often been a point of interest and controversy. Described by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as \"a rocker so compelling that it discourages [[exegesis]]\",<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php Robert Christgau \"Rolling Stones\"]. ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll''. 1976 (accessed 24 June 2007).</ref> \"Brown Sugar{{\"'}}s popularity indeed often overshadowed its scandalous lyrics, which were essentially a pastiche of a number of taboo subjects, including [[slavery]], rape, [[interracial sex]], [[cunnilingus]], [[sadomasochism]], lost [[virginity]] and [[heroin]].<ref>Unterberger, Richie. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t3052783|pure_url=yes}} The Rolling Stones \"Brown Sugar\"].

It features appearances by [[Al Kooper]] on piano, and [[Eric Clapton]] on slide guitar. Richards considered releasing this version on ''Sticky Fingers'', mostly for its more spontaneous atmosphere, but decided on the original.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian McPherson |url=http://timeisonourside.com/SOBrown.html |title=Brown Sugar |website=Timeisonourside.com |date=1969-12-02 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> The alternative version, which had previously been available only on [[bootleg recording]]s, was released in June 2015 on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the reissued ''Sticky Fingers'' album.\n\n==''Top of the Pops''==\nTo promote the song, the Rolling Stones performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the performance taped sometime around late March 1971, and being shown on 15 April and 6 May. They performed \"Brown Sugar\", \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" for the show's segment dedicated to albums, which was shown on 22 April 1971; due to BBC practices at the time, the performances were [[wiping|erased]] and all that remains is \"Brown Sugar\".\n\n==Release==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was eventually released in April 1971 as the first single from the album, becoming a number one hit in both the United States and Canada and a number two hit in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, and has since become a [[classic rock]] radio staple. While the US single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single featured that track plus a live rendition of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\", recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during the 1971 tour of the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Billboard'' ranked it as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1971|number 16 song for 1971]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was originally issued in mono using a now-rarely heard bespoke mono mix. This mono mix has never been used on any compilation.\n\nThe song was performed routinely during the Stones' [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1970|1970 European Tour]], occupying a prominent spot near the end of the [[set list]] even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. The band opened the shows of their infamous [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] with \"Brown Sugar\", and it has become a Stones concert staple.\n\nWhen the Stones perform \"Brown Sugar\" live, Jagger often changes the lyrics from \"Just like a young girl should\" to \"Just like a young man should\". The line \"Hear him whip the women just around midnight\" is often changed to the less offensive \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight\". This is evident on their live albums ''[[Love You Live]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', ''[[Live Licks]]'', ''[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|Shine a Light]]'',''[[Stripped (The Rolling Stones album)#Totally Stripped|Totally Stripped]]'', and Voodoo Lounge Uncut. This change also occurs on the version recorded at Richards's birthday party. The Altamont debut of the song in December 1969 uses \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight.\" (Source: YouTube recordings). \n\nThe song is also the first single released on [[Rolling Stones Records]] (catalogue number RS-19100) and is one of the two Stones songs (along with \"Wild Horses\") licensed to both the band and former manager [[Allen Klein]] (a result of various business disagreements) resulting in its inclusion on the compilation album ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. \"Brown Sugar\" is also included on the most significant latter-day Rolling Stones compilations, ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'', ''[[Forty Licks]]'' and ''[[GRRR!]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was used prominently in the 1981 film ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'' as background music for the scene in which New York police detectives played by [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] search a crowded disco for a terrorist ([[Rutger Hauer]]).\n\n[[Little Richard]] covered the song while he was signed to [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1971)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Austria|10|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Belgium (Flanders)|7|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Honky Tonk Women|chartid=5385|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Germany2|4|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|songid=191|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=18 June 2016}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=27#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand -

It is the opening track and lead single from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it number 495 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and at number five on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596335/brown_sugar/ \"Brown Sugar\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 9 December 2004 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and recording==\nThough credited, like most of their compositions, to the singer/guitarist pair of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], the song was primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' in 1969.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923165126/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 \"Jagger Remembers\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref> The song was written by Jagger with [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]], Jagger's secret girlfriend and mother of his first child Karis, in mind. It is also claimed it was written with [[Claudia Lennear]] in mind. Lennear claimed to be the song's subject on BBC's [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (25 February 2014, ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]''), because she kept Jagger's company at the time when it was written.\n\n\"Brown Sugar\" was recorded over a three-day period at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], from 2 to 4 December 1969. The song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former label. At the request of guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] (who had joined the band as [[Brian Jones]]' replacement in July 1969), the Stones debuted the number live during the infamous concert at the [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]] Speedway on 6 December 1969. \n\nIn the [[liner notes]] to the compilation album ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'' (1993), Jagger says, \"The lyric was all to do with the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very instant thing, a definite high point\".<ref>Covach, John (2005), \"Form in Rock Music: A Primer\", in Stein, Deborah, ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.74-75, {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}} .</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rolling Stone'' interview (14 December 1995, RS 723) Jagger spoke at length about the song, its inspiration and success, and taking credit for writing the lyrics. Keith Richards also credits Jagger with the song in his autobiography.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life|last=Richards|first=Keith|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2010|isbn=978-0-316-03438-8|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref> He attributed the success of the song to a \"good groove\". After noting that the lyrics could mean so many lewd subjects,<ref>{{Citation|last=mayerson|first=hy|title=Metamorphosis|date=2019-03-09|url=https://vimeo.com/322545607|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> he again noted that the combination of those subjects, the lyrical ambiguity was partially why the song was considered successful. He noted, \"That makes it... the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I'm on about on that song. It's such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go... I never would write that song now.\" When [[Jann Wenner|interviewer Jann Wenner]] asked him why, Jagger replied, \"I would probably censor myself. I'd think, 'Oh God, I can't. I've got to stop. I can't just write raw like that.{{'\"}}<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5/ \"Jagger Remembers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 |date=5 December 2009 }}. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe lyrical subject matter has often been a point of interest and controversy. Described by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as \"a rocker so compelling that it discourages [[exegesis]]\",<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php Robert Christgau \"Rolling Stones\"]. ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll''. 1976 (accessed 24 June 2007).</ref> \"Brown Sugar{{\"'}}s popularity indeed often overshadowed its scandalous lyrics, which were essentially a pastiche of a number of taboo subjects, including [[slavery]], rape, [[interracial sex]], [[cunnilingus]], [[sadomasochism]], lost [[virginity]] and [[heroin]].<ref>Unterberger, Richie. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t3052783|pure_url=yes}} The Rolling Stones \"Brown Sugar\"]. ''allmusic''. 2007 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref>\n\nAn alternative version was recorded on 18 December 1970, at [[Olympic Studios]] in London, after (or during) a birthday party for Richards. It features appearances by [[Al Kooper]] on piano, and [[Eric Clapton]] on slide guitar. Richards considered releasing this version on ''Sticky Fingers'', mostly for its more spontaneous atmosphere, but decided on the original.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian McPherson |url=http://timeisonourside.com/SOBrown.html |title=Brown Sugar |website=Timeisonourside.com |date=1969-12-02 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> The alternative version, which had previously been available only on [[bootleg recording]]s, was released in June 2015 on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the reissued ''Sticky Fingers'' album.\n\n==''Top of the Pops''==\nTo promote the song, the Rolling Stones performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the performance taped sometime around late March 1971, and being shown on 15 April and 6 May. They performed \"Brown Sugar\", \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" for the show's segment dedicated to albums, which was shown on 22 April 1971; due to BBC practices at the time, the performances were [[wiping|erased]] and all that remains is \"Brown Sugar\".\n\n==Release==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was eventually released in April 1971 as the first single from the album, becoming a number one hit in both the United States and Canada and a number two hit in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, and has since become a [[classic rock]] radio staple. While the US single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single featured that track plus a live rendition of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\", recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during the 1971 tour of the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Billboard'' ranked it as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1971|number 16 song for 1971]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was originally issued in mono using a now-rarely heard bespoke mono mix. This mono mix has never been used on any compilation.\n\nThe song was performed routinely during the Stones' [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1970|1970 European Tour]], occupying a prominent spot near the end of the [[set list]] even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. The band opened the shows of their infamous [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] with \"Brown Sugar\", and it has become a Stones concert staple.\n\nWhen the Stones perform \"Brown Sugar\" live, Jagger often changes the lyrics from \"Just like a young girl should\" to \"Just like a young man should\". The line \"Hear him whip the women just around midnight\" is often changed to the less offensive \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight\". This is evident on their live albums ''[[Love You Live]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', ''[[Live Licks]]'', ''[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|Shine a Light]]'',''[[Stripped (The Rolling Stones album)#Totally Stripped|Totally Stripped]]'', and Voodoo Lounge Uncut. This change also occurs on the version recorded at Richards's birthday party. The Altamont debut of the song in December 1969 uses \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight.\" (Source: YouTube recordings). \n\nThe song is also the first single released on [[Rolling Stones Records]] (catalogue number RS-19100) and is one of the two Stones songs (along with \"Wild Horses\") licensed to both the band and former manager [[Allen Klein]] (a result of various business disagreements) resulting in its inclusion on the compilation album ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. \"Brown Sugar\" is also included on the most significant latter-day Rolling Stones compilations, ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'', ''[[Forty Licks]]'' and ''[[GRRR!]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was used prominently in the 1981 film ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'' as background music for the scene in which New York police detectives played by [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] search a crowded disco for a terrorist ([[Rutger Hauer]]).\n\n[[Little Richard]] covered the song while he was signed to [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1971)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Austria|10|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Belgium (Flanders)|7|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Honky Tonk Women|chartid=5385|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Germany2|4|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|songid=191|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=18 June 2016}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=27#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand - search listener |website=Flavourofnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Norway|4|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|South Africa<ref>http://www.rock.co.za/files/sa_charts_1969_1989_songs_(A-B).html</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|Spain Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Switzerland|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|2|artist=Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1971)\n!

Classed as phosphoglycoprotein, during storage, it converts into s-ovalbumin (5% at the time of laying) and can reach up to 80% after six months of cold storage. Ovalbumin in solution is heat-resistant. Denaturation temperature is around 84\u00b0C, but it can be easily denatured by physical stresses.\nConalbumin/ovotransferrin is a glycoprotein which has the capacity to bind the bi- and trivalent metal cations into a complex and is more heat sensitive than ovalbumin. At its isoelectric pH (6.5), it can bind two cations and assume a red or yellow color.  These metal complexes are more heat stable than the native state. Ovomucoid is the major allergen from egg white and is a heat-resistant glycoprotein found to be a trypsin inhibitor.  Lysozyme is a [[holoprotein]] which can lyse the wall of certain Gram-positive bacteria and is found at high levels in the chalaziferous layer and the chalazae which anchor the yolk towards the middle of the egg. Ovomucin is a glycoprotein which may contribute to the gel-like structure of thick albumen. The amount of ovomucin in the thick albumen is four times greater than in the thin albumen.\n\n==Foam==\n[[File:Diagram -2 denaturation.svg|thumb|Visual representation of protein denaturation.

Two types of physical stress are caused by beating them with a whisk.  \n\nThe first of which occurs as the whisk drags the liquid through itself, creating a force that unfolds the [[protein]] molecules.

Originally released in 1976, the song was the title track to their duet album released that same year. It was a number-one hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart.\n\n==Recording and composition==\nThe song was conceived by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]], who had seen a [[The_Gun_(1974_film)|television drama]] about the life of a [[handgun]]. The story showed the gun changing hands several times, with a hunter, police officer, criminal and a father of a 2-year-old child all owning the gun at one point, with the consequences played out in each segment.<ref name=Roland>Roland, Tom, \"The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits\" (Billboard Books, Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, 1991 ({{ISBN|0-82-307553-2}})), p. 103</ref>  Braddock applied the same concept to a song about the life of a wedding ring.<ref name=Roland/>\n\nIn the song, a young couple from [[Chicago]] - apparently very much in love - goes to a [[pawn shop]] to shop for a ring for their upcoming wedding. The man (both characters are unnamed in the song) laments that he is unable to pick out a more expensive band, but he is willing to buy it to show how much he loves his bride-to-be, whom - in the song's second verse - he marries in a small [[wedding chapel]] later on that afternoon. In the third verse, the couple has been fighting and, with the marriage clearly in trouble, the man accuses his wife of planning to leave town. Shortly afterward, the woman retorts by telling her husband that she does not love him anymore, throws the ring down and leaves. The final verse features the ring, once again in a pawn shop, waiting for its next owners.\n\nThe [[refrain]]s tell about the meaning of the ring through its lifecycle with the couple. The first refrain speaks of the promise of love shown in the glittering ring; the second verse talks about how \"at last, it's found a home\", and the finale tells of how the ring has been cast aside \"like the love that's dead and gone\". Each refrain ends with how a wedding band is meaningless without love (\"By itself, it's just a cold metallic thing / Only love can make a golden wedding ring\").\n\nAccording to Rich Kienzle's essay for the 1994 [[Sony]] compilation ''The Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country'', the recording features Pete Wade and [[Jerry Kennedy]] on acoustic guitars and drummer Jerry Carrigan playing a snare drum with his hands, as instructed by producer [[Billy Sherrill]].  Released in May 1976 \u2013 14 months after their real-life [[divorce]] \u2013 \"Golden Ring\" was the second George Jones-Tammy Wynette duet to reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart that August. <ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=182}}</ref> With its tale of a young couple's engagement, marriage, and bitter break-up, the song is arguably the one that is most closely identified with Jones and Wynette, whose tumultuous six-year marriage had ended in bitter recrimination.  Country audiences, however, remained more fascinated with the couple than ever, with Eugene Chadbourne of [[AllMusic]] observing, \"The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Ernest Tubb]], who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved.

Originally released in 1976, the song was the title track to their duet album released that same year. It was a number-one hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart.\n\n==Recording and composition==\nThe song was conceived by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]], who had seen a [[The_Gun_(1974_film)|television drama]] about the life of a [[handgun]]. The story showed the gun changing hands several times, with a hunter, police officer, criminal and a father of a 2-year-old child all owning the gun at one point, with the consequences played out in each segment.<ref name=Roland>Roland, Tom, \"The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits\" (Billboard Books, Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, 1991 ({{ISBN|0-82-307553-2}})), p. 103</ref>  Braddock applied the same concept to a song about the life of a wedding ring.<ref name=Roland/>\n\nIn the song, a young couple from [[Chicago]] - apparently very much in love - goes to a [[pawn shop]] to shop for a ring for their upcoming wedding. The man (both characters are unnamed in the song) laments that he is unable to pick out a more expensive band, but he is willing to buy it to show how much he loves his bride-to-be, whom - in the song's second verse - he marries in a small [[wedding chapel]] later on that afternoon. In the third verse, the couple has been fighting and, with the marriage clearly in trouble, the man accuses his wife of planning to leave town. Shortly afterward, the woman retorts by telling her husband that she does not love him anymore, throws the ring down and leaves. The final verse features the ring, once again in a pawn shop, waiting for its next owners.\n\nThe [[refrain]]s tell about the meaning of the ring through its lifecycle with the couple. The first refrain speaks of the promise of love shown in the glittering ring; the second verse talks about how \"at last, it's found a home\", and the finale tells of how the ring has been cast aside \"like the love that's dead and gone\". Each refrain ends with how a wedding band is meaningless without love (\"By itself, it's just a cold metallic thing / Only love can make a golden wedding ring\").\n\nAccording to Rich Kienzle's essay for the 1994 [[Sony]] compilation ''The Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country'', the recording features Pete Wade and [[Jerry Kennedy]] on acoustic guitars and drummer Jerry Carrigan playing a snare drum with his hands, as instructed by producer [[Billy Sherrill]].  Released in May 1976 \u2013 14 months after their real-life [[divorce]] \u2013 \"Golden Ring\" was the second George Jones-Tammy Wynette duet to reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart that August. <ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=182}}</ref> With its tale of a young couple's engagement, marriage, and bitter break-up, the song is arguably the one that is most closely identified with Jones and Wynette, whose tumultuous six-year marriage had ended in bitter recrimination.  Country audiences, however, remained more fascinated with the couple than ever, with Eugene Chadbourne of [[AllMusic]] observing, \"The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Ernest Tubb]], who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did have a relationship.\"\n\nLike many of the duets that the two recorded when they were still husband and wife, 'Golden Ring' resonated with an authentic sense of romantic tragedy and irresolution that was hauntingly similar to the real-life timbre of their troubled, on-again-off-again love affair. {{sfn|Allen, Bob|pp=246|1996}}  Jones, who at the time made no secret of the fact that he still carried a torch for his ex-wife, later addressed the issue of re-teaming with Wynette in his 1996 memoir by insisting, \"That wasn't my idea.
