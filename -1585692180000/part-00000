Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

''ACE Weekly''. 2003.</ref> Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was \"more on-the-fly during the making of ''No Code'', and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\">Peiken, Matt. \"Jack Irons: This Inner Life\".

''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\". Irons stated, \"To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\"/> Vedder said, \"We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.\"<ref name=\"spin\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that \"''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\".

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

''ACE Weekly''. 2003.</ref> Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was \"more on-the-fly during the making of ''No Code'', and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\">Peiken, Matt. \"Jack Irons: This Inner Life\".

''Massive!''. February/March 1998.</ref> Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals.<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> He added that \"Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of ''No Code'', he was so burnt, it was so much work for him.\"<ref name=\"philadelphia\">Moon, Tom. \"Calling Off the Crusades\". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

The song is heavily influenced by [[garage rock]].\n}}\nWhile ''Vitalogy'' had shifted away from the earlier albums' accessible compositions and polished production, ''No Code'' represented a deliberate break from ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'''s [[Arena rock|stadium]] sound, favoring [[Experimental rock|experimental]] ballads and noisy [[garage rock]] songs. It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\". Irons stated, \"To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\"/> Vedder said, \"We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.\"<ref name=\"spin\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that \"''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\".

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its [[autocephaly]] was recognised by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]], [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] after Eritrea gained its independence from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993.\n\n==Origins==\n''Tewa\u1e25ido'' ([[Ge'ez]] \u1270\u12cb\u1215\u12f6 ''tewa\u1e25ido'') is a Ge'ez word meaning \"being made one\", cognate to [[Arabic]] ''[[tawhid]]''. According to the [[Orthodox Encyclopedia]] (1917 edition) article on the [[Henotikon|Henoticon]]:<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm Henoticon]</ref> around 500 bishops within the [[Patriarchate]]s of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]] refused to accept the \"two natures\" doctrine decreed by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, thus separating themselves from the future Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. This separate Christian communion came to be known as Oriental Orthodoxy. Oriental Orthodox Churches, which today include the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] of India, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, are referred to as \"[[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]]\". These Churches themselves describe their [[Christology]] as [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]], but outsiders often incorrectly describe them as \"[[Monophysitism|monophysite]]\".\n\nTewahedo Orthodoxy is a major ethnoreligious group in Eritrea and the largest Christian group there. Christianity has been the majority religion since the 4th century and remains still the largest population. Historically, they spoke Ge'ez, which belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]]. However, the language is now almost extinct, and has been mostly limited to liturgical use since the 10th century. Tewahedo now speak [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. Most also adhere to the Tewahdo Orthodox Church. Tewahdo is an identity and a religion as well for the adherent of Eritrean Tewahdos.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Eritrean Orthodox Church claims its origins from [[Philip the Evangelist]] (''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', chapter 8). It became the [[Christian state|state church]] of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] under [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century through the efforts of a Syrian [[Greeks|Greek]] named [[Frumentius]], known in the church as ''Abba Selama, Kesate Birhan'' (\"Father of Peace, Revealer of Light\"). As a boy, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the Eritrean coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and converted Emperor Ezana to Christianity, causing him to be baptised. Ezana sent Frumentius to [[Alexandria]] to ask the [[Patriarch]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], to appoint a bishop for Axum.  Athanasius appointed Frumentius himself, who returned to Axum as Bishop with the name of ''Abune Selama''. For fifteen centuries afterward, the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria always named a [[Copts|Copt]] to be ''[[Abuna]]'' \"[[metropolitan bishop]]\" of the Ethiopian Church.\n\n==Jesuit interim==\nLittle else is known of church history down to the period of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence, which broke the connection with Egypt.\n\nUnion with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] continued even after Arab conquests in Egypt.  Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and [[Nubia]], until Al Hakim stopped the practice.  Coptic patriarch [[Pope Cyril II of Alexandria|Cyril II]] sent Severus as bishop, with orders to suppress the practice of [[polygamy]] and to enforce observance of canonical consecration for all churches.  These examples show the close relations of the two churches concurrent with the [[Middle Ages]].  Early in the 16th century the church was brought under the influence of a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] mission.\n\nIn 1439, in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]], a religious discussion between [[Abba Giyorgis]] and a French visitor had led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the [[Holy See]]; but the initiative in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missions to Ethiopia was taken, not by the Holy See, but by the church in [[Portugal]], as an incident in the struggle with the [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Adal Sultanate|Sultanate of Adal]]  for the command of the trade route to India by the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn 1507 Matthew (or Matheus), an [[Armenians|Armenian]], had been sent as Ethiopian envoy to Portugal to ask aid against the [[Adal Sultanate]]. In 1520 an embassy under [[:pt:Rodrigo de Lima|Rodrigo de Lima]] landed in Ethiopia (by which time [[Adal Sultanate]] had been remobilized under [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]]). An account of the Portuguese mission, which remained for several years, was written by the chaplain, [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]].\n\nLater, [[Ignatius of Loyola]] wished to essay the task of conversion, but this did not happen.  Instead, the [[pope]] sent out [[:pt:Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto|Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto]] as Patriarch of the East Indies, with [[Andr\u00e9s de Oviedo]] as bishop; and from [[Goa]] envoys (followed by Oviedo) went to Ethiopia.  After repeated failures, some measure of success was achieved under [[Susenyos I]], but not until 1624 did the Emperor make a formal declaration of communion with [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Susenyos made the Catholic Church the official state church, but was met with heavy resistance and, in 1632, had to abdicate in favour of his son, [[Fasilides]], who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the official religion of the country. He then expelled the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1633, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned.\n\n==Colonial years==\nIn the 1920s the Italian colonial power in Eritrea started the first attempts to found a separate Eritrean Orthodox Church. Until then the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was practically part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with a strong link to Aksum in Tigray as the traditional centre of the Church structure. This was, however, against the interest of the colonizer: Eritrea as a separate colony was supposed to have a church independent from the neighbor's influence, in order to be fully integrated into the colonial system. The separate Eritrean Church was short-lived. When it was still not fully established, the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and then formed a unified territory, [[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]], encompassing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Italian Somalia. Eritrea was unified with the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray, and both Orthodox Churches unified. This unification remained valid even after the defeat of the Italians and their loss of the whole territory in 1941.\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted [[autocephaly]] by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in 1950. At that time Eritrea was a separate colonial territory under British administration, but nevertheless the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was simply made a division of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as the British had no interest to strongly separate the [[Eritrean Highlands]] from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], corresponding to their politics of unification of the highlands (with the option of separation of the Muslim lowlands of Eritrea and their inclusion into the British Sudan).\n\n==Autocephaly after independence of Eritrea==\nFollowing the independence of [[Eritrea]] from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993, the newly independent [[Eritrea]]n government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly.\nTensions were high between the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and no representative from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body. However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the Autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it. Eritrea's first two Patriarchs were originally Archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, [[Abune Phillipos]] did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two Churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out between the two countries in 1998. The two churches, remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], although the Ethiopian Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch, [[Abune Dioskoros]].\n\nThe first Patriarch of Eritrea was [[Abune Phillipos]] who died in 2002 and was succeeded by [[Abune Yacob]]. The reign of [[Abune Yacob]] as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by [[Abune Antonios]] as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected on 5 March 2004, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 24 April 2004. [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]] presided at the ceremony in [[Asmara]], together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] delegation.\n\nIn August 2005, Abune Antonios, the Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 13 January 2006, Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published, the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January 2006 letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. Abune Antonios was deposed by the Eritrean Holy Synod<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20060201-033933-4818r |title=Orthodox patriarch of Eritrea sacked |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2007-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083755/http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20060201-033933-4818r |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> supposedly under pressure from the Eritrean government; as of 2006 he is under house arrest.<ref>{{cite news | title =Eritrea Imposes New Controls on Orthodox Church  | publisher = Compass Direct News  | year =2006  | url =http://www.crosswalk.com/news/religiontoday/1457982.html | accessdate =2007-01-05}}</ref> Abuna Antonios was replaced by [[Abune Dioskoros]] as the 4th Patriarch of the church. The majority believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed against the canon of the Orthodox Church. Many still consider him the legal Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Church. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters. The illegally enthroned Patriarch Abuna Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015. No successor has been elected to date.\n\n==Sacramental beliefs==\nIn common with all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches|Western Orthodox]] churches; the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Old Catholic]] churches of the [[Union of Utrecht]], the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church professes belief in the seven sacraments of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], [[eucharist]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], the [[anointing of the sick]], [[matrimony]], and [[holy orders]]. It regards the first four as being \"necessary for every believer\".<ref name=\"prairienet.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |title=prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921211416/http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |archive-date=2008-09-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs is the tradition of the East, non-episcopal clergy may be married at the time of ordination, which is reserved for adult males. In order to demonstrate that a bishop is a member of a synod, there must be at least three bishops taking part in any episcopal ordination.\n\nThe Church holds the ancient Christian belief in the [[Real Presence]] of [[Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]] stating that \"''The consecrated bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ. Jesus Christ is truly, really and substantially present in the consecrated elements. In the Eucharist, we eat the blessed flesh of our Lord and drink His precious blood under the form of bread and wine.\"''<ref name=\"prairienet.org\"/> Ceremonies are elaborate by western standards.\n\nThe practice of reconciliation in the sacrament of penance is regarded as strictly personal, and members of the Church are encouraged to select a confessor (also referred to as a 'soul father') who is well known to them and with whom they are comfortable.\n\nAs in other Eastern Christian traditions, the bond of marriage is able to be dissolved, but only on the grounds of adultery. To safeguard the practice of the faith, Church members are discouraged from marrying people outside of the Orthodox communion. Church members who undergo a purely civil ceremony are not regarded as sacramentally married.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm#mat |title=prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907050947/http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm#mat |archive-date=2008-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Distinctive traits==\n\n===Biblical canon===\n{{Main|Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon}}\nThe Tewahedo Church Biblical Canon contains 81 books, including almost all of those which are accepted by other Orthodox and Oriental Christians; the exception is the [[Books of the Maccabees]], at least some of which are accepted in the Eastern Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox churches, but not in the Tewahedo churches (the books of Meqabyan, which are accepted instead, have an etymologically connected name, but rather different content). The Eritrean Orthodox canon and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon are identical.\n* The Narrower Canon also contains [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]], [[Jubilees]], and  three books of the [[Meqabyan]];\n* The Broader Canon includes all of the books found in the Narrower Canon, as well as the two ''Books of the Covenant'', Four ''Books of Sinodos'', a ''Book of Clement'', and [[Didascalia]];\n\nThere have been no printings of the Broader Canon since the beginning of the twentieth century. The ''Haile Selassie Version of the Bible'', which was published in 1962, contains the Narrower Canon.\n\n===Language===\nThe Divine Liturgy and other religious services of the Eritrean Church are celebrated in the [[Ge'ez language]], which has been the language of the Church even before the arrival of the [[Nine Saints]] (Abba Pantelewon, Abba Gerima (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Abba Aftse, Abba Guba, Abba Alef, Abba Yem\u2019ata, Abba Liqanos, and Abba Sehma), who fled persecution by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451).  The [[Septuagint]] version was translated into Ge'ez.  [[Sermons]] are delivered in the local [[language]].\n\n===Similarities to Judaism===\nThe Eritrean church like the Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Judaism]]. Eritrean Christians, like some other [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]], traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish [[Kashrut]], specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike [[Rabbinical Judaism|Rabbinical]] Kashrut, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] does mix [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|dairy products with meat]]. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or ''shash'') while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox [[synagogue]]s, men and women are seated separately in the Eritrean church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar).<ref name=\"Hable1997\">{{cite book|last=Hable Selassie|first=Sergew|title=The Church of Ethiopia \u2013 A panorama of History and Spiritual Life|year=1997|publisher=Berhanena Selam|location=Addis Abeba, Ethiopia|page=66}}</ref> (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, [[Islam]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]] among them).

He was succeeded by [[Abune Yacob]] in 2002 and [[Abune Antonios]] in 2004. Abune Antonios objected the Government actions to the confiscation of church properties, hijacking church offerings, expropriation of tithes and pressing priests and deacons to military services. After he strenuously opposed the government\u2019s interference in the affairs of the church, the government of Eritrea, which took His Holiness\u2019s demands as an affront and challenge to its rule, deposed the leader of more than half of the Eritrean population and finally put him under house arrest in 2006.\n\nIn April 2007, the Synod elected a new patriarch, namely [[Abune Dioskoros]] who was the incumbent Patriarch of Eritrea until his death on 21 December 2015, although his reign was disputed by followers of the aged and frail Abune Antonios who endorse the latter as a continuing legitimate Patriarch of the church.\n\nList of Abunas:\n:*''Vacant'' (1994\u20131999)\n*[[Abune Phillipos|Phillipos]] (1999\u20132001)\n*[[Abune Yacob|Yacob]] (2002\u20132004)\n*[[Abune Antonios|Antonios]] (2004\u20132007) \u2013 Deposed by the Eritrean government and by the so-called \"synod\" against the canon of the Church but still regarded as the legitimate Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church.\n*[[Abune Dioskoros|Dioskoros]] (2007\u20132015) \u2013 Passed away.

Tewahedo Church''' is an [[Oriental Orthodox]] church with its headquarters in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. Its [[autocephaly]] was recognised by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]], [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] after Eritrea gained its independence from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993.\n\n==Origins==\n''Tewa\u1e25ido'' ([[Ge'ez]] \u1270\u12cb\u1215\u12f6 ''tewa\u1e25ido'') is a Ge'ez word meaning \"being made one\", cognate to [[Arabic]] ''[[tawhid]]''. According to the [[Orthodox Encyclopedia]] (1917 edition) article on the [[Henotikon|Henoticon]]:<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm Henoticon]</ref> around 500 bishops within the [[Patriarchate]]s of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]] refused to accept the \"two natures\" doctrine decreed by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, thus separating themselves from the future Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. This separate Christian communion came to be known as Oriental Orthodoxy. Oriental Orthodox Churches, which today include the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] of India, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, are referred to as \"[[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]]\". These Churches themselves describe their [[Christology]] as [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]], but outsiders often incorrectly describe them as \"[[Monophysitism|monophysite]]\".\n\nTewahedo Orthodoxy is a major ethnoreligious group in Eritrea and the largest Christian group there. Christianity has been the majority religion since the 4th century and remains still the largest population. Historically, they spoke Ge'ez, which belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]]. However, the language is now almost extinct, and has been mostly limited to liturgical use since the 10th century. Tewahedo now speak [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. Most also adhere to the Tewahdo Orthodox Church. Tewahdo is an identity and a religion as well for the adherent of Eritrean Tewahdos.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Eritrean Orthodox Church claims its origins from [[Philip the Evangelist]] (''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', chapter 8). It became the [[Christian state|state church]] of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] under [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century through the efforts of a Syrian [[Greeks|Greek]] named [[Frumentius]], known in the church as ''Abba Selama, Kesate Birhan'' (\"Father of Peace, Revealer of Light\"). As a boy, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the Eritrean coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and converted Emperor Ezana to Christianity, causing him to be baptised. Ezana sent Frumentius to [[Alexandria]] to ask the [[Patriarch]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], to appoint a bishop for Axum.  Athanasius appointed Frumentius himself, who returned to Axum as Bishop with the name of ''Abune Selama''. For fifteen centuries afterward, the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria always named a [[Copts|Copt]] to be ''[[Abuna]]'' \"[[metropolitan bishop]]\" of the Ethiopian Church.\n\n==Jesuit interim==\nLittle else is known of church history down to the period of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence, which broke the connection with Egypt.\n\nUnion with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] continued even after Arab conquests in Egypt.  Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and [[Nubia]], until Al Hakim stopped the practice.  Coptic patriarch [[Pope Cyril II of Alexandria|Cyril II]] sent Severus as bishop, with orders to suppress the practice of [[polygamy]] and to enforce observance of canonical consecration for all churches.  These examples show the close relations of the two churches concurrent with the [[Middle Ages]].  Early in the 16th century the church was brought under the influence of a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] mission.\n\nIn 1439, in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]], a religious discussion between [[Abba Giyorgis]] and a French visitor had led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the [[Holy See]]; but the initiative in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missions to Ethiopia was taken, not by the Holy See, but by the church in [[Portugal]], as an incident in the struggle with the [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Adal Sultanate|Sultanate of Adal]]  for the command of the trade route to India by the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn 1507 Matthew (or Matheus), an [[Armenians|Armenian]], had been sent as Ethiopian envoy to Portugal to ask aid against the [[Adal Sultanate]]. In 1520 an embassy under [[:pt:Rodrigo de Lima|Rodrigo de Lima]] landed in Ethiopia (by which time [[Adal Sultanate]] had been remobilized under [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]]). An account of the Portuguese mission, which remained for several years, was written by the chaplain, [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]].\n\nLater, [[Ignatius of Loyola]] wished to essay the task of conversion, but this did not happen.  Instead, the [[pope]] sent out [[:pt:Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto|Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto]] as Patriarch of the East Indies, with [[Andr\u00e9s de Oviedo]] as bishop; and from [[Goa]] envoys (followed by Oviedo) went to Ethiopia.  After repeated failures, some measure of success was achieved under [[Susenyos I]], but not until 1624 did the Emperor make a formal declaration of communion with [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Susenyos made the Catholic Church the official state church, but was met with heavy resistance and, in 1632, had to abdicate in favour of his son, [[Fasilides]], who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the official religion of the country. He then expelled the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1633, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned.\n\n==Colonial years==\nIn the 1920s the Italian colonial power in Eritrea started the first attempts to found a separate Eritrean Orthodox Church. Until then the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was practically part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with a strong link to Aksum in Tigray as the traditional centre of the Church structure. This was, however, against the interest of the colonizer: Eritrea as a separate colony was supposed to have a church independent from the neighbor's influence, in order to be fully integrated into the colonial system. The separate Eritrean Church was short-lived. When it was still not fully established, the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and then formed a unified territory, [[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]], encompassing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Italian Somalia. Eritrea was unified with the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray, and both Orthodox Churches unified. This unification remained valid even after the defeat of the Italians and their loss of the whole territory in 1941.\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted [[autocephaly]] by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in 1950. At that time Eritrea was a separate colonial territory under British administration, but nevertheless the Orthodox Church in Eritrea was simply made a division of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as the British had no interest to strongly separate the [[Eritrean Highlands]] from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], corresponding to their politics of unification of the highlands (with the option of separation of the Muslim lowlands of Eritrea and their inclusion into the British Sudan).\n\n==Autocephaly after independence of Eritrea==\nFollowing the independence of [[Eritrea]] from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993, the newly independent [[Eritrea]]n government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly.\nTensions were high between the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and no representative from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body. However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the Autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it. Eritrea's first two Patriarchs were originally Archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, [[Abune Phillipos]] did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two Churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out between the two countries in 1998. The two churches, remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], although the Ethiopian Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch, [[Abune Dioskoros]].\n\nThe first Patriarch of Eritrea was [[Abune Phillipos]] who died in 2002 and was succeeded by [[Abune Yacob]]. The reign of [[Abune Yacob]] as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by [[Abune Antonios]] as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected on 5 March 2004, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 24 April 2004. [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]] presided at the ceremony in [[Asmara]], together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] delegation.\n\nIn August 2005, Abune Antonios, the Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 13 January 2006, Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published, the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January 2006 letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

The majority believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed against the canon of the Orthodox Church. Many still consider him the legal Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Church. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters. The illegally enthroned Patriarch Abuna Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015. No successor has been elected to date.\n\n==Sacramental beliefs==\nIn common with all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches|Western Orthodox]] churches; the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Old Catholic]] churches of the [[Union of Utrecht]], the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church professes belief in the seven sacraments of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], [[eucharist]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], the [[anointing of the sick]], [[matrimony]], and [[holy orders]]. It regards the first four as being \"necessary for every believer\".<ref name=\"prairienet.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |title=prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921211416/http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/eotc.htm |archive-date=2008-09-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs is the tradition of the East, non-episcopal clergy may be married at the time of ordination, which is reserved for adult males. In order to demonstrate that a bishop is a member of a synod, there must be at least three bishops taking part in any episcopal ordination.\n\nThe Church holds the ancient Christian belief in the [[Real Presence]] of [[Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]] stating that \"''The consecrated bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ. Jesus Christ is truly, really and substantially present in the consecrated elements. In the Eucharist, we eat the blessed flesh of our Lord and drink His precious blood under the form of bread and wine.\"''<ref name=\"prairienet.org\"/> Ceremonies are elaborate by western standards.\n\nThe practice of reconciliation in the sacrament of penance is regarded as strictly personal, and members of the Church are encouraged to select a confessor (also referred to as a 'soul father') who is well known to them and with whom they are comfortable.\n\nAs in other Eastern Christian traditions, the bond of marriage is able to be dissolved, but only on the grounds of adultery. To safeguard the practice of the faith, Church members are discouraged from marrying people outside of the Orthodox communion. Church members who undergo a purely civil ceremony are not regarded as sacramentally married.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm#mat |title=prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907050947/http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/basic.htm#mat |archive-date=2008-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Distinctive traits==\n\n===Biblical canon===\n{{Main|Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon}}\nThe Tewahedo Church Biblical Canon contains 81 books, including almost all of those which are accepted by other Orthodox and Oriental Christians; the exception is the [[Books of the Maccabees]], at least some of which are accepted in the Eastern Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox churches, but not in the Tewahedo churches (the books of Meqabyan, which are accepted instead, have an etymologically connected name, but rather different content). The Eritrean Orthodox canon and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon are identical.\n* The Narrower Canon also contains [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]], [[Jubilees]], and  three books of the [[Meqabyan]];\n* The Broader Canon includes all of the books found in the Narrower Canon, as well as the two ''Books of the Covenant'', Four ''Books of Sinodos'', a ''Book of Clement'', and [[Didascalia]];\n\nThere have been no printings of the Broader Canon since the beginning of the twentieth century. The ''Haile Selassie Version of the Bible'', which was published in 1962, contains the Narrower Canon.\n\n===Language===\nThe Divine Liturgy and other religious services of the Eritrean Church are celebrated in the [[Ge'ez language]], which has been the language of the Church even before the arrival of the [[Nine Saints]] (Abba Pantelewon, Abba Gerima (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Abba Aftse, Abba Guba, Abba Alef, Abba Yem\u2019ata, Abba Liqanos, and Abba Sehma), who fled persecution by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451).  The [[Septuagint]] version was translated into Ge'ez.  [[Sermons]] are delivered in the local [[language]].\n\n===Similarities to Judaism===\nThe Eritrean church like the Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Judaism]]. Eritrean Christians, like some other [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]], traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish [[Kashrut]], specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike [[Rabbinical Judaism|Rabbinical]] Kashrut, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] does mix [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|dairy products with meat]]. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or ''shash'') while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox [[synagogue]]s, men and women are seated separately in the Eritrean church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar).<ref name=\"Hable1997\">{{cite book|last=Hable Selassie|first=Sergew|title=The Church of Ethiopia \u2013 A panorama of History and Spiritual Life|year=1997|publisher=Berhanena Selam|location=Addis Abeba, Ethiopia|page=66}}</ref> (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, [[Islam]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]] among them). Eritrean Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church temple,<ref name=\"Hable1997\" /> in accordance with [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:5 (in which [[Moses]], while viewing the [[burning bush]], was commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church is [[Sabbatarian]], observing the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] on Saturday, in addition to the [[Lord's Day]] on Sunday,<ref name=\"inc1998\">{{cite book|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3oxAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2017|year=1998|language=English |isbn=9780852296332|page=581}}</ref> although more emphasis, because of the [[Resurrection]] of Christ, is laid upon Sunday. The Eritrean Orthodox Church calls for male [[circumcision]], with near-universal prevalence among Orthodox men in Eritrea.<ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Circumcision |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/circumcision.html }}</ref>\n\n==Patriarchs and bishops of Eritrea==\n{{main|List of Abunas of Eritrea}}\nAfter declaration of [[autocephaly]] of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church was recognized by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in 1994, the newly established patriarchal seat of Eritrea remained vacant until 1999 when Philipos was elected [[Abune Phillipos]] and the first patriarch of Eritrea (1999\u20132001). He was succeeded by [[Abune Yacob]] in 2002 and [[Abune Antonios]] in 2004. Abune Antonios objected the Government actions to the confiscation of church properties, hijacking church offerings, expropriation of tithes and pressing priests and deacons to military services. After he strenuously opposed the government\u2019s interference in the affairs of the church, the government of Eritrea, which took His Holiness\u2019s demands as an affront and challenge to its rule, deposed the leader of more than half of the Eritrean population and finally put him under house arrest in 2006.\n\nIn April 2007, the Synod elected a new patriarch, namely [[Abune Dioskoros]] who was the incumbent Patriarch of Eritrea until his death on 21 December 2015, although his reign was disputed by followers of the aged and frail Abune Antonios who endorse the latter as a continuing legitimate Patriarch of the church.\n\nList of Abunas:\n:*''Vacant'' (1994\u20131999)\n*[[Abune Phillipos|Phillipos]] (1999\u20132001)\n*[[Abune Yacob|Yacob]] (2002\u20132004)\n*[[Abune Antonios|Antonios]] (2004\u20132007) \u2013 Deposed by the Eritrean government and by the so-called \"synod\" against the canon of the Church but still regarded as the legitimate Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church.\n*[[Abune Dioskoros|Dioskoros]] (2007\u20132015) \u2013 Passed away.
