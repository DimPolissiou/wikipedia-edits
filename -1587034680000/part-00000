Some have powerful jets for [[massage]] purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as [[spa]]s or by the trade name [[Jacuzzi]].\n\nIn contrast to a typical [[bathtub]], a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a [https://www.splashandrelax.co.uk/hot-tubs hot tub] is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for [[swimming pool sanitation]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest hot tubs were [[Caldera|calderas]] in which hot stones were placed to heat the water.{{cn|date=August 2019}} [[Therma, Icaria|Therma]] in [[Icaria|Ikaria]] has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC.<ref name=\"greeka.com\">[http://www.greeka.com/eastern_aegean/ikaria/ikaria-excursions/ikaria-ancient-spa.htm Ikaria: The Ancient Spa of Therma in Ikaria Greece, Eastern Aegean], Greeka.com.</ref> The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times.<ref name=\"greeka.com\"/>\n\nIn 737 A.D., Japan's first [[onsen]] opened near [[Izumo, Shimane]], and centuries later the first [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called [[ofuro]].\n\nIn ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schadewalt H. The history of Roman bathing culture [in Dutch]. Integraal1989;4:25\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour.<ref>Jackson R.

Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by [[Jacuzzi]]. [[Fiberglass]] shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.\n\n==Water treatment==\n\n===Plumbing===\nThe plumbing of the hot tub consists of:\n* A pressure system delivering water to the jets\n* A suction system returning water to the pumps.\n* A [[Hot tub filter|filtration system]]: the plumbing has to incorporate a filter system to help clean the water. Some models use a separate small 24/7 filter pump while others use programmed settings of the main pumps.\n* Induced air: The jets may use a [[venturi effect]] to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.\n* Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different \"bubbly\" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air.\n* An [[ozone]] system: ozonation is a common adjunct to water maintenance, and if installed will have its own set of hoses and fittings.\n\n===Heating and energy use===\nHot tubs are usually heated using an [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as [[solar hot water]] systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural [[hot spring]]s; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature.\n\nEffective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available.

Some have powerful jets for [[massage]] purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as [[spa]]s or by the trade name [[Jacuzzi]].\n\nIn contrast to a typical [[bathtub]], a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for [[swimming pool sanitation]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest hot tubs were [[Caldera|calderas]] in which hot stones were placed to heat the water.{{cn|date=August 2019}} [[Therma, Icaria|Therma]] in [[Icaria|Ikaria]] has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC.<ref name=\"greeka.com\">[http://www.greeka.com/eastern_aegean/ikaria/ikaria-excursions/ikaria-ancient-spa.htm Ikaria: The Ancient Spa of Therma in Ikaria Greece, Eastern Aegean], Greeka.com.</ref> The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times.<ref name=\"greeka.com\"/>\n\nIn 737 A.D., Japan's first [[onsen]] opened near [[Izumo, Shimane]], and centuries later the first [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called [[ofuro]].\n\nIn ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schadewalt H. The history of Roman bathing culture [in Dutch]. Integraal1989;4:25\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour.<ref>Jackson R.

Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by [[Jacuzzi]]. [[Fiberglass]] shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.\n\n==Water treatment==\n\n===Plumbing===\nThe plumbing of the hot tub consists of:\n* A pressure system delivering water to the jets\n* A suction system returning water to the pumps.\n* A [[Hot tub filter|filtration system]]: the plumbing has to incorporate a filter system to help clean the water. Some models use a separate small 24/7 filter pump while others use programmed settings of the main pumps.\n* Induced air: The jets may use a [[venturi effect]] to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.\n* Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different \"bubbly\" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air.\n* An [[ozone]] system: ozonation is a common adjunct to water maintenance, and if installed will have its own set of hoses and fittings.\n\n===Heating and energy use===\nHot tubs are usually heated using an [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as [[solar hot water]] systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural [[hot spring]]s; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature.\n\nEffective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available.

In these cases, combined hormonal contraceptive pills will not address the primary cause of menstrual cessation: inhibition of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]] due to excessive exercise. Thus, behavioral modifications should be pursued.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile [[Hypoestrogenism|hypoestrogenemia]] has been linked to an increase in inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women, this correlation does not seem to contribute to endothelial dysfunction in patients with exercise-associated amenorrhea (EAA).<ref name=\":12\" /> Potential causes for this dissociation are the known anti-inflammatory effects of exercise training and moderate caloric restriction via increased [[glucocorticoid]] and [[ghrelin]] production, among other factors.<ref name=\":12\" /> While the role of ovulatory status on these cardiovascular adaptations is unclear, moderate negative energy balance has been found to increase vagal tone, thereby lowering [[resting heart rate]] and [[systolic blood pressure]] in animals.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nWhether due to surgery or menopause, estrogen deficiency has also been shown to increase [[Low-density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein (LDLc)]] and decrease [[High-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDLc)]] in women, whereas endogenous [[estrogen]], exercise training, on caloric restriction without malnutrition have been found to do the opposite in eumenorrheic controls.<ref name=\":12\" /> In an interesting position between these two alternatives, elevations in total [[cholesterol]], [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDLc]], [[Apolipoprotein B|apolipoprotein]] B, and triglycerides are common in women with EAA. At the same time, this population is also likely to display the characteristic increase in [[High-density lipoprotein|HDLc]] expected to result from exercise training and caloric restriction.<ref name=\":12\" /> Despite these increases, however, the concentrations do not exceed the traditionally recommended limits of [[cholesterol]] management. At present, it is unknown if the positive effects of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDLc]] are able to counteract the effects of elevated [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDLc]] in this population.<ref name=\":12\" /> Another juxtaposition is found in the fact that rather than improving [[Bone density|BMD]], as is expected by exercise, patients with EAA commonly display [[osteopenia]].<ref name=\":1\" /> If exercise contributes to a negative energy balance, either through excess activity or inadequate caloric intake, stress and skeletal fractures, as well as premature bone loss, becomes a significant risk.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome studies suggest female athletes with FHA may also be affected by [[hyperandrogenism]] in addition to [[hypoestrogenism]], and it is the [[hyperandrogenism]] (as seen in [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]) that causes the menstrual irregularity, rather than chronic low energy availability and low [[estrogen]] levels.<ref name=\":6\" /> While this population may also suffer from higher fasting [[glucose]] and blood pressure, less stress fractures and higher [[Bone density|BMDs]] have been observed in patients whose FHA may be due to [[Hyperandrogenism|hyperandrogenemia]].<ref name=\":6\" /> However, although further studies and analysis is needed in this area, these findings may imply that LH/FSH ratios could be used as a future biomarker of metabolic and skeletal health in amenorrheic female athletes.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Genetic Predisposition ===\n[[Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism|Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)]], otherwise known as congenital [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] deficiency, has a known genetic basis.

The variable expressivity of the disorder, likely resulting from epigenetic modifications and/or multiple genetic defects, has led to the hypothesis that mutations involved in [[Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism|IHH]] cause increased risk for the functional [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] deficiency observed in FHA patients.<ref name=\":13\" /> Heterozygous mutations at loci implicated in [[Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism|IHH]] have been shown to be present in patients with FHA at a rate higher than eumenorrheic controls.<ref name=\":13\" /> The genes implicated included the following: [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1|FGFR1]], which is involved in the specification, fate, migration, and survival of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]-secreting neurons, [[Prokineticin receptor 2|PROKR2]] and [[KAL1 gene|KAL1]], which enable the migration of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]-secreting neurons, and [[GNRHR]], which encodes the pituitary receptor activated by [[GNRH1|GnRH1]].<ref name=\":13\" /> Mutations in [[Prokineticin receptor 2|PROKR2]] or [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1|FGFR1]] may cause mechanistic dysfunction of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pathways by either decreasing the number of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]-secreting cells that are able to migrate to the hypothalamus in development, inhibiting maturation of these cells during maturity, or disrupting [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion in adulthood.<ref name=\":13\" /> FHA patients harboring these mutations have been shown to be able to resume regular menses, further reinforcing that while genetic defects may predispose one to the condition, environmental factors play a pivotal role in disease manifestation.<ref name=\":13\" /> It is possible that heterozygosity at these loci are not sufficient to cause [[Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism|IHH]], but decrease the threshold for [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO]] inhibition due to environmental factors such as weight loss, stress, and excessive exercise.<ref name=\":13\" /> Functionally speaking, carrying these mutations could confer a selective advantage in a famine conditions, and it is not uncommon for the alleles to be inherited from an asymptomatic parents in both heterozygous and homozygous recessive manifestations of [[Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism|IHH]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\n\n=== Hormonal ===\nFHA results from a functional reduction or disruption in [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] release due to chronic negative energy balance, metabolism, body composition, and stress;

this event allows for the pituitary to begin producing and releasing pulses of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]].<ref name=\":3\" />  Full [[folliculogenesis]] cannot occur if the initial [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] drive is disrupted, and this can be caused by reduced [[leptin]] from loss of body fat due to nutritional deprivation, excessive exercise in which the calories burned are more than those consumed, and states of hypercortisolism due to stress-inducing attitudinal or environmental pressures.<ref name=\":3\" /> Specifically, this underlies why the hypothalamus is necessarily sensitive to internal and external stimuli in its regulation of menstruation.Complete synchrony or the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]] is required for ovulation and reproduction in order to ensure pulsatile release of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]].<ref name=\":11\" /> Without this pulsatile release, the reduced levels of [[gonadotropin]]s LH and FSH are insufficient to maintain full [[folliculogenesis]] and ovulatory ovarian function, resulting in profound [[hypoestrogenism]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":03\" />\n\nAdditionally, external stress factors activate the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|HPA axis]]; increased [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)]] secretion results in increased secretion of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] from the pituitary gland, and thus increased secretion of [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], a regulator of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis|HPA]] and [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO]] axis, can be stimulated for release by the central nervous system in states of physical or mental stress that accompany the lifestyle factors contributing to amenorrhea.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] is released from the pituitary along with other pro-opiomelanocortin-related peptides such as [[Beta-Endorphin|beta-endorphin]] and b-lipotropic hormone.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is possible that increased levels of [[ghrelin]] in amenorrheic populations sensitizes the adrenal cortex to [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] and is thereby associated with both hypothalamic [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]] release and the frequency of cortisol bursts.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Glucocorticoid|Glucocorticosteroids]] are generally associated with inhibition of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]], adding strength to the stress-induced hypothesis of amenorrhea in some patients.<ref name=\":1\" /> By stimulating [[Beta-Endorphin|beta-endorphin]], a hypothalamic and pituitary endogenous peptide, [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]] can indirectly alter [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] function by acting upstream on [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]].<ref name=\":1\" /> A combination of this factor, along with the direct inhibition of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] caused by elevated [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], may suggest a relationship between the incidence of stress- and exercise-related FHA and opioidergic activity.<ref name=\":1\" /> FHA patients have been found to have higher 24-hour mean plasma [[cortisol]] levels as well as increased cerebrospinal and urinary free cortisol levels;

In turn, this leads to the inhibition of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pulsatility directly at the level of the hypothalamus and therefore precludes multilevel inhibition of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis]] is also altered in FHA; [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] levels are low-to-normal and there is an increase in reverse [[triiodothyronine]] and low level of [[triiodothyronine]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Relative energy expenditure (REE) is also closely linked to [[Triiodothyronine|T<sub>3</sub>]], as is evidenced by a correlation between macronutrient intake, REE, and [[Thyroid hormones|thyroid hormone]] levels.<ref name=\":9\" /> It has been found that [[Anorexia nervosa|AN]] patients who regain weight can restore [[Triiodothyronine|T<sub>3</sub>]] and REE independent of changes in FFM.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOther hormonal changes in FHA include increased levels of nighttime serum [[Growth hormone|growth hormone (GH)]], decreased levels of 24 hour [[prolactin]], low serum [[insulin]] and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], and increased [[insulin]] sensitivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Growth hormone|GH]] has been found to be higher systemically in [[Anorexia nervosa|AN]] and exercise-induced FHA, with women who have the lowest FFM and body mass index [[Body mass index|BMI]] displaying the highest levels of circulating [[Growth hormone|GH]]<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />  The result is peripheral resistance to [[Growth hormone|GH]], and this underlies the reduction in hepatic [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] synthesis observed in many of these patients.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Growth hormone|GH]] may also modulate reproduction at the level of the pituitary and ovaries by altering LH/FSH secretion as well as [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] production.<ref name=\":9\" /> Some studies suggest that [[Growth hormone|GH]] is needed for the maturation and survival of dominant follicles and [[Corpus luteum|corpora lutea]].<ref name=\":9\" /> Increased [[insulin]] sensitivity  is likely common in many FHA patients because a state of chronic low EA incentivizes high [[Growth hormone|GH]] secretion to maintain euglycemia; thus, euglycemia can be maintained in FHA patients despite low levels of [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Neuroendocrine ===\nThe complex mechanisms of FHA are unclear, though it is known that many neuromodulatory signals are involved in the regulation of [[Pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some notable substances include [[kisspeptin]], [[Neuropeptide Y|neuropeptide Y (NPY)]], [[ghrelin]], peptide YY (PYY), [[leptin]], [[adiponectin]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], [[Beta-Endorphin|\u03b2-endorphin]], and [[allopregnanolone]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Kisspeptin]] and its [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptor]], GPR54, activate the [[HPO axis]] to directly stimulate [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion from the hypothalamus.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] regulates energy balance and affects feeding behavior and appetite.<ref name=\":1\" /> If [[Estradiol|estradiol (E2)]] levels are sufficient, [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] induces [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion.<ref name=\":1\" /> Amenorrheic women have been found to have lower serum [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] than controls. Thus, in these hypoestrogenic subjects, decreased concentrations of this peptide may contribute to the observed disruption of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] release.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Ghrelin]] stimulates appetite and inhibits the [[HPO axis]], and it is found to be elevated in patients with FHA.<ref name=\":1\" />  Despite this, many patients with FHA display behaviors which result in low energy intake and therefore weight loss.<ref name=\":9\" /> It can be additionally noted that this trend may also be observed to a lesser extent in ovulatory women who are in negative energy balance due to imposed dieting and exercise strategies.<ref name=\":9\" /> Alternatively, PYY binds to hypothalamic neurons in order to decrease both energy intake and body weight.<ref name=\":9\" /> It has been suggested that the anorexigenic effects of PYY may hide the anticipated orexigenic effects of increased [[ghrelin]] levels in exercising and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]] FHA patients. The combination of these factors could help explain why populations whose conditions have been triggered by low weight or excess exercise are not only more prone to display elevated serum [[ghrelin]] levels, but also commonly engage in abnormal eating behaviors.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Ghrelin]] not only reduces fat utilization and stimulates appetite, but increased ghrelin is linked to alterations in [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] pulsatility, which can ultimately inhibit the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> Its elevation in women with FHA may account for the inability of some patients who have returned to a healthy weight to return to regular menses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nConversely, [[leptin]] is reduced in patients with FHA and this may suppress [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] through a [[kisspeptin]]-mediated pathway.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> [[Leptin]] and [[adiponectin]] are secreted by adipocytes and are directly related to FFM, with the former being directly related and the latter being inversely related.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Leptin]] coordinates metabolic and hormonal signals with reproductive function, and decreased levels of leptin have been shown to decrease [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] pulsatile frequency.<ref name=\":11\" /> As [[leptin]] mainly decreases feeding behavior, negative energy states have been linked to decreased leptin levels when fat mass is at critically low levels.<ref name=\":11\" /> Thus, hypoleptinemia is often representative of the chronic negative energy balance associated with FHA, and this trend  holds true when compared to age-, weight-, and body fat-matched eumenorrheic controls<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Further, the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the hypothalamus, which is known for its regulation of food intake, is considered to be the most concentrated source of both [[leptin]] and [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] receptors in the brain.<ref name=\":11\" /> While [[GnRH]] receptors in the hypothalamus do not contain receptors for [[leptin]], a positive correlation has been shown to exist between leptin receptor mRNA and the [[kisspeptin]]-expressing cells which are known to stimulate [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] release.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Clinical presentation ==\nFHA can be caused by chronic stress,<ref name=\":2\" /> whether it be from psychosocial/emotional/mental factors, weight-related factors, or exercise-induced factors. As such, the clinical manifestations of the disorder are the result of this chronic stress caused by the above three factors. The \"classic\" description was previously a \"thin woman who undereats and overexercises,\"<ref name=\":2\" /> but recent studies are finding FHA can also present as a \"high-achieving individual\"<ref name=\":2\" /> with poor stress-management behaviors that include under- or over-eating and overexercising.<ref name=\":2\" /> It therefore follows that there may also be symptoms of the [[female athlete triad]], [[Eating disorder|eating disorders,]] low bone density, or [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\":11\" /> Some may willing consume insufficient calories in conjunction with or independent of an underlying [[eating disorder]], meaning that women with FHA may be normal weight or underweight.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":03\" /> In amenorrheic athletes who have a near-normal weight, menses may be restored during periods of deceased training.<ref name=\":03\" /> The fact that nutritional restoration is insufficient for restoring menses in some women highlights the influence that psychological issues, including mood disorders and obsessive patterns of behavior such as hyper-exercise and/or restrictive eating behavior, impart on the etiology of FHA.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe disease can present in a variety of ways in both adolescents and adult women. Patients may present with subclinical menstrual dysfunction, ovulatory amenorrhea, amenorrhea, or have a history of combination of these disturbances.<ref name=\":03\" /> In most cases, there is a gradual loss of ovulation and menses demonstrated as the diseases manifests, followed by the eventual cessation of menstrual cycles altogether.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, menstrual status should be considered a \u201cvital sign\u201d for all routine clinical visits because of the known effects of [[hypoestrogenism]] on bone and tissue health.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Reproductive ===\nFHA can have long and short term consequences in a patient's reproductive development and fertility. [[Anovulation]] and [[amenorrhea]] is the characteristic feature of FHA.<ref name=\":1\" /> If [[hypoestrogenism]] and impaired [[HPO axis]] occurs during puberty, [[primary amenorrhea]] occurs.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the impairment occurs after puberty, [[secondary amenorrhea]] occurs, which is more common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn a physical exam, FHA presents with delayed development, with patients halted in the [[Sex characteristics|secondary and tertiary sex characteristics]] of the pubertal stage before they developed FHA.<ref name=\":0\" /> The severity of the symptoms depends on the duration and severity of [[hypoestrogenism]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn adolescents, FHA presents with delayed [[menarche]] and non-specific development of [[Puberty|pubertal stages]], and underdevelopment of [[Sex characteristics|secondary and tertiary sex characteristics]].<ref name=\":1\" /> In adult women, FHA can lead to atrophic changes, such as lack of [[cervical mucus]], thinning of [[vaginal epithelium]], and uterine muscle atrophy ([[Uterine hypoplasia|hypoplasia]]), which can lead to painful intercourse ([[dyspareunia]]).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBecause [[anovulation]] is a characteristic feature, patients often suffer from [[infertility]]. Patients with a history of, or who currently have, FHA, who become pregnant, require extra care and monitoring during pregnancy to avoid the increased risks of inadequate weight gain, [[Intrauterine growth restriction|intrauterine fetal growth restrictions]], [[miscarriage]], and/or [[Preterm birth|preterm labor]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Bone ===\nDecreased fat tissue mass and imbalances between bodyweight, fat tissue mass, and lean body mass has been linked to reduced [[Bone density|BMD]] in FHA patients; however, absolute bone strength has not always been found to be affected.<ref name=\":1\" /> The majority of people reach their [[Peak bone mass|peak bone mass (PBM)]] around 30 years of age, however, 40-50% of that mass is formed during puberty.<ref name=\":1\" /> When FHA occurs in adolescence, inability to reach [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] becomes a primary concern, as 40-60% of factors contributing to PBM are of hormonal and nutritional influence.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Estrogen]]s, [[androgen]]s, [[Growth hormone|GH]], and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] are the main determinants of [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] formation.<ref name=\":1\" />  In women, [[estrogen]]s are the main component in proper [[bone formation]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Through the stimulation of growth factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B)]], [[Bone morphogenetic protein 6|bone morphogenetic protein 6 (6-BMP-6)]], and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] and inhibition of [[RANKL|receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)]], [[estrogen]] tends to suppress bone resorption and activate bone formation and remodeling units.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because FHA causes [[hypoestrogenism]], women with FHA may lack age-appropriate [[bone density]]<ref name=\":2\" /> and have an increased risk of skeletal fragility, [[stress fracture]]s, [[osteopenia]], and [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The profile of low serum [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], low serum [[insulin]], and high serum [[cortisol]] also contribute to low [[Bone density|BMD]].<sup>8</sup> [[Adiponectin]] has also been found to regulate the activity of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteoclast]]s, possibly providing a link between the abnormal concentrations found in FHA patients with altered bone metabolism.<ref name=\":9\" /> Additionally, women with FHA may have improper diets or [[malnutrition]], leading to [[Hypocalcaemia|low calcium]] and [[Vitamin D deficiency|vitamin D intake]], and may have a tendency to overexercise, which further increases the risk for [[osteopenia]].<ref name=\":1\" /> This improper dieting and tendency to overexercise, leading to low bone density, is also seen in [[RED-S]].<ref name=\":7\" /> Unlike in males diagnosed with [[Relative energy deficiency in sport|RED-S]], females are at an increased risk for the consequences of decreased [[bone density]], since females have a [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] 25-30% lower than males.<ref name=\":1\" /> Although this decreased [[bone density]] is also seen in [[anorexia nervosa]], the severity of peak [[bone density]] loss is less in FHA patients.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cardiovascular ===\n[[Cardiovascular disease|Cardiovascular disease (CVD)]] is the leading cause of death in women in developed countries, and it is well studied that [[hypoestrogenism]] has many regulatory functions in the [[cardiovascular system]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Estradiol]] ([[Estradiol|E2]]), an [[estrogen]] steroid hormone and the major female [[Sex-hormone|sex hormone]], has a cardio-protective effect.<ref name=\":1\" /> As such, [[hypoestrogenism]] caused by FHA causes significant impairment in the [[Endothelium|endothelial]] and

In these cases, combined hormonal contraceptive pills will not address the primary cause of menstrual cessation: inhibition of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]] due to excessive exercise. Thus, behavioral modifications should be pursued.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile [[Hypoestrogenism|hypoestrogenemia]] has been linked to an increase in inflammatory markers in postmenopausal women, this correlation does not seem to contribute to endothelial dysfunction in patients with exercise-associated amenorrhea (EAA).<ref name=\":12\" /> Potential causes for this dissociation are the known anti-inflammatory effects of exercise training and moderate caloric restriction via increased [[glucocorticoid]] and [[ghrelin]] production, among other factors.<ref name=\":12\" /> While the role of ovulatory status on these cardiovascular adaptations is unclear, moderate negative energy balance has been found to increase vagal tone, thereby lowering [[resting heart rate]] and [[systolic blood pressure]] in animals.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nWhether due to surgery or menopause, estrogen deficiency has also been shown to increase [[Low-density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein (LDLc)]] and decrease [[High-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDLc)]] in women, whereas endogenous [[estrogen]], exercise training, on caloric restriction without malnutrition have been found to do the opposite in eumenorrheic controls.<ref name=\":12\" /> In an interesting position between these two alternatives, elevations in total [[cholesterol]], [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDLc]], [[Apolipoprotein B|apolipoprotein]] B, and triglycerides are common in women with EAA. At the same time, this population is also likely to display the characteristic increase in [[High-density lipoprotein|HDLc]] expected to result from exercise training and caloric restriction.<ref name=\":12\" /> Despite these increases, however, the concentrations do not exceed the traditionally recommended limits of [[cholesterol]] management. At present, it is unknown if the positive effects of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDLc]] are able to counteract the effects of elevated [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDLc]] in this population.<ref name=\":12\" /> Another juxtaposition is found in the fact that rather than improving [[Bone density|BMD]], as is expected by exercise, patients with EAA commonly display [[osteopenia]].<ref name=\":1\" /> If exercise contributes to a negative energy balance, either through excess activity or inadequate caloric intake, stress and skeletal fractures, as well as premature bone loss, becomes a significant risk.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSome studies suggest female athletes with FHA may also be affected by [[hyperandrogenism]] in addition to [[hypoestrogenism]], and it is the [[hyperandrogenism]] (as seen in [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]) that causes the menstrual irregularity, rather than chronic low energy availability and low [[estrogen]] levels.<ref name=\":6\" /> While this population may also suffer from higher fasting [[glucose]] and blood pressure, less stress fractures and higher [[Bone density|BMDs]] have been observed in patients whose FHA may be due to [[Hyperandrogenism|hyperandrogenemia]].<ref name=\":6\" /> However, although further studies and analysis is needed in this area, these findings may imply that LH/FSH ratios could be used as a future biomarker of metabolic and skeletal health in amenorrheic female athletes.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Genetic Predisposition ===\n[[Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism|Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)]], otherwise known as congenital [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] deficiency, has a known genetic basis.

In turn, this leads to the inhibition of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pulsatility directly at the level of the hypothalamus and therefore precludes multilevel inhibition of the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis]] is also altered in FHA; [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] levels are low-to-normal and there is an increase in reverse [[triiodothyronine]] and low level of [[triiodothyronine]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Relative energy expenditure (REE) is also closely linked to [[Triiodothyronine|T<sub>3</sub>]], as is evidenced by a correlation between macronutrient intake, REE, and [[Thyroid hormones|thyroid hormone]] levels.<ref name=\":9\" /> It has been found that [[Anorexia nervosa|AN]] patients who regain weight can restore [[Triiodothyronine|T<sub>3</sub>]] and REE independent of changes in FFM.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nOther hormonal changes in FHA include increased levels of nighttime serum [[Growth hormone|growth hormone (GH)]], decreased levels of 24 hour [[prolactin]], low serum [[insulin]] and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], and increased [[insulin]] sensitivity.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Growth hormone|GH]] has been found to be higher systemically in [[Anorexia nervosa|AN]] and exercise-induced FHA, with women who have the lowest FFM and body mass index [[Body mass index|BMI]] displaying the highest levels of circulating [[Growth hormone|GH]]<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />  The result is peripheral resistance to [[Growth hormone|GH]], and this underlies the reduction in hepatic [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] synthesis observed in many of these patients.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Growth hormone|GH]] may also modulate reproduction at the level of the pituitary and ovaries by altering LH/FSH secretion as well as [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] production.<ref name=\":9\" /> Some studies suggest that [[Growth hormone|GH]] is needed for the maturation and survival of dominant follicles and [[Corpus luteum|corpora lutea]].<ref name=\":9\" /> Increased [[insulin]] sensitivity  is likely common in many FHA patients because a state of chronic low EA incentivizes high [[Growth hormone|GH]] secretion to maintain euglycemia; thus, euglycemia can be maintained in FHA patients despite low levels of [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Neuroendocrine ===\nThe complex mechanisms of FHA are unclear, though it is known that many neuromodulatory signals are involved in the regulation of [[Pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some notable substances include [[kisspeptin]], [[Neuropeptide Y|neuropeptide Y (NPY)]], [[ghrelin]], peptide YY (PYY), [[leptin]], [[adiponectin]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], [[Beta-Endorphin|\u03b2-endorphin]], and [[allopregnanolone]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Kisspeptin]] and its [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptor]], GPR54, activate the [[HPO axis]] to directly stimulate [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion from the hypothalamus.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] regulates energy balance and affects feeding behavior and appetite.<ref name=\":1\" /> If [[Estradiol|estradiol (E2)]] levels are sufficient, [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] induces [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] secretion.<ref name=\":1\" /> Amenorrheic women have been found to have lower serum [[Neuropeptide Y|NPY]] than controls. Thus, in these hypoestrogenic subjects, decreased concentrations of this peptide may contribute to the observed disruption of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] release.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Ghrelin]] stimulates appetite and inhibits the [[HPO axis]], and it is found to be elevated in patients with FHA.<ref name=\":1\" />  Despite this, many patients with FHA display behaviors which result in low energy intake and therefore weight loss.<ref name=\":9\" /> It can be additionally noted that this trend may also be observed to a lesser extent in ovulatory women who are in negative energy balance due to imposed dieting and exercise strategies.<ref name=\":9\" /> Alternatively, PYY binds to hypothalamic neurons in order to decrease both energy intake and body weight.<ref name=\":9\" /> It has been suggested that the anorexigenic effects of PYY may hide the anticipated orexigenic effects of increased [[ghrelin]] levels in exercising and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]] FHA patients. The combination of these factors could help explain why populations whose conditions have been triggered by low weight or excess exercise are not only more prone to display elevated serum [[ghrelin]] levels, but also commonly engage in abnormal eating behaviors.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Ghrelin]] not only reduces fat utilization and stimulates appetite, but increased ghrelin is linked to alterations in [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] pulsatility, which can ultimately inhibit the [[Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis|HPO axis]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> Its elevation in women with FHA may account for the inability of some patients who have returned to a healthy weight to return to regular menses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nConversely, [[leptin]] is reduced in patients with FHA and this may suppress [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] through a [[kisspeptin]]-mediated pathway.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> [[Leptin]] and [[adiponectin]] are secreted by adipocytes and are directly related to FFM, with the former being directly related and the latter being inversely related.<ref name=\":9\" /> [[Leptin]] coordinates metabolic and hormonal signals with reproductive function, and decreased levels of leptin have been shown to decrease [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] pulsatile frequency.<ref name=\":11\" /> As [[leptin]] mainly decreases feeding behavior, negative energy states have been linked to decreased leptin levels when fat mass is at critically low levels.<ref name=\":11\" /> Thus, hypoleptinemia is often representative of the chronic negative energy balance associated with FHA, and this trend  holds true when compared to age-, weight-, and body fat-matched eumenorrheic controls<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Further, the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the hypothalamus, which is known for its regulation of food intake, is considered to be the most concentrated source of both [[leptin]] and [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] receptors in the brain.<ref name=\":11\" /> While [[GnRH]] receptors in the hypothalamus do not contain receptors for [[leptin]], a positive correlation has been shown to exist between leptin receptor mRNA and the [[kisspeptin]]-expressing cells which are known to stimulate [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] release.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Clinical presentation ==\nFHA can be caused by chronic stress,<ref name=\":2\" /> whether it be from psychosocial/emotional/mental factors, weight-related factors, or exercise-induced factors. As such, the clinical manifestations of the disorder are the result of this chronic stress caused by the above three factors. The \"classic\" description was previously a \"thin woman who undereats and overexercises,\"<ref name=\":2\" /> but recent studies are finding FHA can also present as a \"high-achieving individual\"<ref name=\":2\" /> with poor stress-management behaviors that include under- or over-eating and overexercising.<ref name=\":2\" /> It therefore follows that there may also be symptoms of the [[female athlete triad]], [[Eating disorder|eating disorders,]] low bone density, or [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\":11\" /> Some may willing consume insufficient calories in conjunction with or independent of an underlying [[eating disorder]], meaning that women with FHA may be normal weight or underweight.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":03\" /> In amenorrheic athletes who have a near-normal weight, menses may be restored during periods of deceased training.<ref name=\":03\" /> The fact that nutritional restoration is insufficient for restoring menses in some women highlights the influence that psychological issues, including mood disorders and obsessive patterns of behavior such as hyper-exercise and/or restrictive eating behavior, impart on the etiology of FHA.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe disease can present in a variety of ways in both adolescents and adult women. Patients may present with subclinical menstrual dysfunction, ovulatory amenorrhea, amenorrhea, or have a history of combination of these disturbances.<ref name=\":03\" /> In most cases, there is a gradual loss of ovulation and menses demonstrated as the diseases manifests, followed by the eventual cessation of menstrual cycles altogether.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, menstrual status should be considered a \u201cvital sign\u201d for all routine clinical visits because of the known effects of [[hypoestrogenism]] on bone and tissue health.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Reproductive ===\nFHA can have long and short term consequences in a patient's reproductive development and fertility. [[Anovulation]] and [[amenorrhea]] is the characteristic feature of FHA.<ref name=\":1\" /> If [[hypoestrogenism]] and impaired [[HPO axis]] occurs during puberty, [[primary amenorrhea]] occurs.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the impairment occurs after puberty, [[secondary amenorrhea]] occurs, which is more common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn a physical exam, FHA presents with delayed development, with patients halted in the [[Sex characteristics|secondary and tertiary sex characteristics]] of the pubertal stage before they developed FHA.<ref name=\":0\" /> The severity of the symptoms depends on the duration and severity of [[hypoestrogenism]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn adolescents, FHA presents with delayed [[menarche]] and non-specific development of [[Puberty|pubertal stages]], and underdevelopment of [[Sex characteristics|secondary and tertiary sex characteristics]].<ref name=\":1\" /> In adult women, FHA can lead to atrophic changes, such as lack of [[cervical mucus]], thinning of [[vaginal epithelium]], and uterine muscle atrophy ([[Uterine hypoplasia|hypoplasia]]), which can lead to painful intercourse ([[dyspareunia]]).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBecause [[anovulation]] is a characteristic feature, patients often suffer from [[infertility]]. Patients with a history of, or who currently have, FHA, who become pregnant, require extra care and monitoring during pregnancy to avoid the increased risks of inadequate weight gain, [[Intrauterine growth restriction|intrauterine fetal growth restrictions]], [[miscarriage]], and/or [[Preterm birth|preterm labor]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Bone ===\nDecreased fat tissue mass and imbalances between bodyweight, fat tissue mass, and lean body mass has been linked to reduced [[Bone density|BMD]] in FHA patients; however, absolute bone strength has not always been found to be affected.<ref name=\":1\" /> The majority of people reach their [[Peak bone mass|peak bone mass (PBM)]] around 30 years of age, however, 40-50% of that mass is formed during puberty.<ref name=\":1\" /> When FHA occurs in adolescence, inability to reach [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] becomes a primary concern, as 40-60% of factors contributing to PBM are of hormonal and nutritional influence.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Estrogen]]s, [[androgen]]s, [[Growth hormone|GH]], and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] are the main determinants of [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] formation.<ref name=\":1\" />  In women, [[estrogen]]s are the main component in proper [[bone formation]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Through the stimulation of growth factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B)]], [[Bone morphogenetic protein 6|bone morphogenetic protein 6 (6-BMP-6)]], and [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] and inhibition of [[RANKL|receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)]], [[estrogen]] tends to suppress bone resorption and activate bone formation and remodeling units.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because FHA causes [[hypoestrogenism]], women with FHA may lack age-appropriate [[bone density]]<ref name=\":2\" /> and have an increased risk of skeletal fragility, [[stress fracture]]s, [[osteopenia]], and [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The profile of low serum [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], low serum [[insulin]], and high serum [[cortisol]] also contribute to low [[Bone density|BMD]].<sup>8</sup> [[Adiponectin]] has also been found to regulate the activity of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteoclast]]s, possibly providing a link between the abnormal concentrations found in FHA patients with altered bone metabolism.<ref name=\":9\" /> Additionally, women with FHA may have improper diets or [[malnutrition]], leading to [[Hypocalcaemia|low calcium]] and [[Vitamin D deficiency|vitamin D intake]], and may have a tendency to overexercise, which further increases the risk for [[osteopenia]].<ref name=\":1\" /> This improper dieting and tendency to overexercise, leading to low bone density, is also seen in [[RED-S]].<ref name=\":7\" /> Unlike in males diagnosed with [[Relative energy deficiency in sport|RED-S]], females are at an increased risk for the consequences of decreased [[bone density]], since females have a [[Peak bone mass|PBM]] 25-30% lower than males.<ref name=\":1\" /> Although this decreased [[bone density]] is also seen in [[anorexia nervosa]], the severity of peak [[bone density]] loss is less in FHA patients.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cardiovascular ===\n[[Cardiovascular disease|Cardiovascular disease (CVD)]] is the leading cause of death in women in developed countries, and it is well studied that [[hypoestrogenism]] has many regulatory functions in the [[cardiovascular system]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Estradiol]] ([[Estradiol|E2]]), an [[estrogen]] steroid hormone and the major female [[Sex-hormone|sex hormone]], has a cardio-protective effect.<ref name=\":1\" /> As such, [[hypoestrogenism]] caused by FHA causes significant impairment in the [[Endothelium|endothelial]] and

is expected from the presence of heightened levels of superoxides and decreased [[Nitric oxide|NO]] bioavailability in women with FHA, it has been found that [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDLc]] is mildly
