The medulla oblongata then distributes messages along [[Motor neuron|motor or efferent nerves]] belonging to the [[autonomic nervous system]] to a wide variety of effector organs, whose activity is consequently changed to reverse the error in the blood pressure. One of the effector organs is the heart whose rate is stimulated to rise ([[tachycardia]]) when the arterial blood pressure falls, or to slow down ([[bradycardia]]) when the pressure rises above set point.<ref name=tortora2 /> Thus the heart rate (for which there is no sensor in the body) is not homeostatically controlled, but is one of effector responses to errors in the arterial blood pressure.

The arterioles are the main resistance vessels in the [[arterial tree]], and small changes in diameter cause large changes in the resistance to flow through them. When the arterial blood pressure rises the arterioles are stimulated to [[vasodilation|dilate]] making it easier for blood to leave the arteries, thus deflating them, and bringing the blood pressure down, back to normal. At the same time the heart is stimulated via [[cholinergic]] [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic nerves]] to beat more slowly (called [[bradycardia]]), ensuring that the inflow of blood into the arteries is reduced, thus adding to the reduction in pressure, and correction of the original error.\n\nLow pressure in the arteries, causes the opposite reflex of constriction of the arterioles, and a speeding up of the heart rate (called [[tachycardia]]). If the drop in blood pressure is very rapid or excessive, the medulla oblongata stimulates the [[adrenal medulla]], via \"preganglionic\" [[sympathetic nerves]], to secrete [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) into the blood. This hormone enhances the tachycardia and causes severe [[vasoconstriction]] of the arterioles to all but the essential organ in the body (especially the heart, lungs, and brain).

The sensors for the second are the [[parafollicular cells]] in the [[thyroid gland]]. The parathyroid chief cells secrete [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) in response to a fall in the plasma ionized calcium level; the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland secrete [[calcitonin]] in response to a rise in the  plasma ionized calcium level.\n\nThe [[Effector (biology)|effector]] organs of the first homeostatic mechanism are the [[bone]]s, the [[kidney]], and, via a hormone released into the blood by the kidney in response to high PTH levels in the blood, the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. Parathyroid hormone (in high concentrations in the blood) causes [[bone resorption]], releasing calcium into the plasma. This is a very rapid action which can correct a threatening [[hypocalcemia]] within minutes. High PTH concentrations cause the excretion of [[Phosphate|phosphate ions]] via the urine. Since phosphates combine with calcium ions to form insoluble salts (see also [[bone mineral]]), a decrease in the level of phosphates in the blood, releases free calcium ions into the plasma ionized calcium pool. PTH has a second action on the kidneys. It stimulates the manufacture and release, by the kidneys, of [[calcitriol]] into the blood. This [[steroid]] hormone acts on the epithelial cells of the upper small intestine, increasing their capacity to absorb calcium from the gut contents into the blood.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light.|page=707 |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

However, when the blood circulates through the lungs a pulmonary capillary [[Endothelium|endothelial]] enzyme called [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) cleaves a further two amino acids from angiotensin I to form an octapeptide known as [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin II|angiotensin II]].  Angiotensin II is a hormone which acts on the [[adrenal cortex]], causing the release into the blood of the [[steroid hormone]], [[aldosterone]]. Angiotensin II also acts on the smooth muscle in the walls of the arterioles causing these small diameter vessels to constrict, thereby restricting the outflow of blood from the arterial tree, causing the arterial blood pressure to rise. This, therefore, reinforces the measures described above (under the heading of \"Arterial blood pressure\"), which defend the arterial blood pressure against changes, especially [[hypotension]].\n\nThe angiotensin II-stimulated [[aldosterone]] released from the [[zona glomerulosa]] of the [[adrenal glands]] has an effect on particularly the epithelial cells of the [[distal convoluted tubules]] and [[collecting ducts]] of the kidneys.

The hyponatremia can only be ''corrected'' by the consumption of salt in the diet. However, it is not certain whether a \"salt hunger\" can be initiated by hyponatremia, or by what mechanism this might come about.\n\nWhen the plasma sodium ion concentration is higher than normal ([[hypernatremia]]), the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is halted, ceasing the production of angiotensin II, and its consequent aldosterone-release into the blood. The kidneys respond by excreting sodium ions into the urine, thereby normalizing the plasma sodium ion concentration. The low angiotensin II levels in the blood lower the arterial blood pressure as an inevitable concomitant response.\n\nThe reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid as a result of high aldosterone levels in the blood does not, of itself, cause renal tubular water to be returned to the blood from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s or [[collecting duct]]s. This is because sodium is reabsorbed in exchange for potassium and therefore causes only a modest change in the [[Osmotic pressure|osmotic gradient]] between the blood and the tubular fluid. Furthermore, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts is impermeable to water in the absence of [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) in the blood. ADH is part of the control of [[fluid balance]]. Its levels in the blood vary with the [[osmolality]] of the plasma, which is measured in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain. Aldosterone's action on the kidney tubules prevents sodium loss to the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF). So there is no change in the osmolality of the ECF, and therefore no change in the ADH concentration of the plasma. However, low aldosterone levels cause a loss of sodium ions from the ECF, which could potentially cause a change in extracellular osmolality and therefore of ADH levels in the blood.\n\n===Potassium concentration===\n{{Main |Potassium#Homeostasis |Potassium in biology}}\nHigh potassium concentrations in the plasma cause [[depolarization]] of the [[zona glomerulosa]] cells' membranes in the outer layer of the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref name=\"pmid22546854\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu C, Rusin CG, Tan Z, Guagliardo NA, Barrett PQ |title=Zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal cortex are intrinsic electrical oscillators. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=2046\u20132053 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22546854 |doi=10.1172/JCI61996 |pmc=3966877}}</ref> This causes the release of [[aldosterone]] into the blood.\n\nAldosterone acts primarily on the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[collecting duct]]s of the kidneys, stimulating the excretion of potassium ions into the urine.<ref name=tortora3 /> It does so, however, by activating the [[basolateral]] [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps]] of the tubular epithelial cells.

[[Fluid balance]] involves keeping the fluid volume stabilized, and also keeping the levels of [[electrolyte]]s in the extracellular fluid stable. Fluid balance is maintained by the process of [[osmoregulation]] and by behavior. [[Osmotic pressure]] is detected by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[median preoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. Measurement of the plasma [[osmolality]] to give an indication of the water content of the body, relies on the fact that water losses from the body, (through [[Transepidermal water loss|unavoidable water loss through the skin]] which is not entirely waterproof and therefore always slightly moist, [[Breathing#Upper airways|water vapor in the exhaled air]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[vomiting]], normal [[feces]] and especially  [[diarrhea]]) are all [[hypotonic]], meaning that they are less salty than the body fluids (compare, for instance, the taste of saliva with that of tears. The latter has almost the same salt content as the extracellular fluid, whereas the former is hypotonic with respect to the plasma. Saliva does not taste salty, whereas tears are decidedly salty). Nearly all normal and abnormal losses of [[body water]] therefore cause the extracellular fluid to become [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]]. Conversely, excessive fluid intake dilutes the extracellular fluid causing the hypothalamus to register [[hypotonic hyponatremia]] conditions.\n\nWhen the [[hypothalamus]] detects a hypertonic extracellular environment, it causes the secretion of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) called [[vasopressin]] which acts on the effector organ, which in this case is the [[kidney]]. The effect of vasopressin on the kidney tubules is to reabsorb water from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[Collecting duct system|collecting ducts]], thus preventing aggravation of the water loss via the urine. The hypothalamus simultaneously stimulates the nearby [[Thirst|thirst center]] causing an almost irresistible (if the hypertonicity is severe enough) urge to drink water. The cessation of urine flow prevents the [[hypovolemia]] and [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonicity]] from getting worse; the drinking of water corrects the defect.\n\nHypo-osmolality results in very low plasma ADH levels. This results in the inhibition of water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, causing high volumes of very dilute urine to be excreted, thus getting rid of the excess water in the body.\n\nUrinary water loss, when the body water homeostat is intact, is a ''compensatory'' water loss, ''correcting'' any water excess in the body. However, since the kidneys cannot generate water, the thirst reflex is the all-important second effector mechanism of the body water homeostat, ''correcting'' any water deficit in the body.\n\n===Blood pH===\n[[File:2714_Respiratory_Regulation_of_Blood.jpg|border|right|364x364px]]\n{{Main|Acid\u2013base homeostasis |Acid-base imbalance}}\nThe [[pH#Living systems|plasma pH]] can be altered by respiratory changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide; or altered by metabolic changes in the [[carbonic acid]] to [[bicarbonate ion]] ratio. The [[bicarbonate buffer system]] regulates the ratio of carbonic acid  to bicarbonate to be equal to 1:20, at which ratio the blood pH is 7.4 (as explained in the [[Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation]]). A change in the plasma pH gives an [[acid\u2013base imbalance]].\nIn [[acid\u2013base homeostasis]] there are two mechanisms that can help regulate the pH. [[Respiratory compensation]] a mechanism of the [[respiratory center]], adjusts the [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] by changing the rate and depth of breathing, to bring the pH back to normal. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide also determines the concentration of carbonic acid, and the bicarbonate buffer system can also come into play. Renal compensation can help the bicarbonate buffer system.\nThe sensor for the plasma bicarbonate concentration is not known for certain. It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma.{{citation needed |date=November 2017}} The metabolism of these cells produces carbon dioxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen and bicarbonate through the action of [[carbonic anhydrase]].<ref name=tortora1 /> When the ECF pH falls (becoming more acidic) the renal tubular cells excrete hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid to leave the body via urine.

The resulting reaction in the plasma is the formation of carbonic acid which is in equilibrium with the plasma partial pressure of carbon dioxide.  This is tightly regulated to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of carbonic acid or bicarbonate. The overall effect is therefore that hydrogen ions are lost in the urine when the pH of the plasma falls. The concomitant rise in the plasma bicarbonate mops up the increased hydrogen ions (caused by the fall in plasma pH) and the resulting excess carbonic acid is disposed of in the lungs as carbon dioxide.

Almost any homeostatic component can malfunction either as a result of an [[genetic disorder|inherited defect]], an [[inborn error of metabolism]], or an acquired disease. Some homeostatic mechanisms have inbuilt redundancies, which ensures that life is not immediately threatened if a component malfunctions; but sometimes a homeostatic malfunction can result in serious disease, which can be fatal if not treated. A well-known example of a homeostatic failure is shown in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]].

However, the compensating mechanisms eventually wear out or are disrupted by a new complicating factor (such as the advent of a concurrent acute viral infection), which sends the body reeling through a new cascade of events. Such decompensation unmasks the underlying disease, worsening its symptoms.

In this view, the entire planet maintains several homeostasis (the primary one being temperature homeostasis). Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is open to debate. However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, it is sometimes claimed that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, certain plants may be able to grow better and thus act to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, warming has exacerbated droughts, making water the actual [[limiting factor]] on land. When sunlight is plentiful and the atmospheric temperature climbs, it has been claimed that the [[phytoplankton]] of the ocean surface waters, acting as global sunshine, and therefore heat sensors, may thrive and produce more [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS). The DMS molecules act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]], which produce more clouds, and thus increase the atmospheric [[albedo]], and this feeds back to lower the temperature of the atmosphere. However, rising sea temperature has stratified the oceans, separating warm, sunlit waters from cool, nutrient-rich waters. Thus, nutrients have become the limiting factor, and plankton levels have actually fallen over the past 50 years, not risen. As scientists discover more about Earth, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered, that, together, maintain a metastable condition, sometimes within a very broad range of environmental conditions.\n\n==Predictive==\nPredictive homeostasis is an anticipatory response to an expected challenge in the future, such as the stimulation of insulin secretion by gut hormones which enter the blood in response to a meal.<ref name=koeslag /> This insulin secretion occurs before the blood sugar level rises, lowering the blood sugar level in anticipation of a large influx into the blood of glucose resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates in the gut.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach | year = 2009 | publisher = Saunders/Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 9781416031154 | edition=  2nd International | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Such anticipatory reactions are open loop systems which are based, essentially, on \"guess work\", and are not self-correcting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |last2=Saunders |first2=P.T. |last3=Wessels |first3=J.A. | title=Glucose homeostasis with infinite gain: further lessons from the Daisyworld parable? |journal= Journal of Endocrinology | date=1997 |volume=134 |pages=187\u2013192  }}</ref> Anticipatory responses always require a closed loop negative feedback system to correct the 'over-shoots' and 'under-shoots' to which the anticipatory systems are prone.\n\n==Other fields==\nThe term has come to be used in other fields, for example:\n\n===Risk===\n{{Main|Risk homeostasis}}\nAn [[actuary]] may refer to ''risk homeostasis'', where (for example) people who have anti-lock brakes have no better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits.

The glycogen is stored in the liver, but the triglycerides are secreted into the blood as [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles which are taken up by [[adipose tissue]], there to be stored as fats. The fat cells take up glucose through special glucose transporters ([[GLUT4]]), whose numbers in the cell wall are increased as a direct effect of insulin acting on these cells. The glucose that enters the fat cells in this manner is converted into triglycerides (via the same metabolic pathways as are used by the liver) and then stored in those fat cells together with the VLDL-derived triglycerides that were made in the liver. Muscle cells also take glucose up through insulin-sensitive GLUT4 glucose channels, and convert it into muscle glycogen.\n\nA  fall in blood glucose, causes insulin secretion to be stopped, and [[glucagon]] to be secreted from the alpha cells into the blood.

The sensors for the second are the [[parafollicular cells]] in the [[thyroid gland]].

Parathyroid hormone (in high concentrations in the blood) causes [[bone resorption]], releasing calcium into the plasma. This is a very rapid action which can correct a threatening [[hypocalcemia]] within minutes. High PTH concentrations cause the excretion of [[Phosphate|phosphate ions]] via the urine. Since phosphates combine with calcium ions to form insoluble salts (see also [[bone mineral]]), a decrease in the level of phosphates in the blood, releases free calcium ions into the plasma ionized calcium pool. PTH has a second action on the kidneys. It stimulates the manufacture and release, by the kidneys, of [[calcitriol]] into the blood. This [[steroid]] hormone acts on the epithelial cells of the upper small intestine, increasing their capacity to absorb calcium from the gut contents into the blood.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light.|page=707 |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

However, when the blood circulates through the lungs a pulmonary capillary [[Endothelium|endothelial]] enzyme called [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) cleaves a further two amino acids from angiotensin I to form an octapeptide known as [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin II|angiotensin II]].  Angiotensin II is a hormone which acts on the [[adrenal cortex]], causing the release into the blood of the [[steroid hormone]], [[aldosterone]]. Angiotensin II also acts on the smooth muscle in the walls of the arterioles causing these small diameter vessels to constrict, thereby restricting the outflow of blood from the arterial tree, causing the arterial blood pressure to rise. This, therefore, reinforces the measures described above (under the heading of \"Arterial blood pressure\"), which defend the arterial blood pressure against changes, especially [[hypotension]].\n\nThe angiotensin II-stimulated [[aldosterone]] released from the [[zona glomerulosa]] of the [[adrenal glands]] has an effect on particularly the epithelial cells of the [[distal convoluted tubules]] and [[collecting ducts]] of the kidneys.

The hyponatremia can only be ''corrected'' by the consumption of salt in the diet. However, it is not certain whether a \"salt hunger\" can be initiated by hyponatremia, or by what mechanism this might come about.\n\nWhen the plasma sodium ion concentration is higher than normal ([[hypernatremia]]), the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is halted, ceasing the production of angiotensin II, and its consequent aldosterone-release into the blood. The kidneys respond by excreting sodium ions into the urine, thereby normalizing the plasma sodium ion concentration. The low angiotensin II levels in the blood lower the arterial blood pressure as an inevitable concomitant response.\n\nThe reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid as a result of high aldosterone levels in the blood does not, of itself, cause renal tubular water to be returned to the blood from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s or [[collecting duct]]s. This is because sodium is reabsorbed in exchange for potassium and therefore causes only a modest change in the [[Osmotic pressure|osmotic gradient]] between the blood and the tubular fluid. Furthermore, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts is impermeable to water in the absence of [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) in the blood. ADH is part of the control of [[fluid balance]]. Its levels in the blood vary with the [[osmolality]] of the plasma, which is measured in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain. Aldosterone's action on the kidney tubules prevents sodium loss to the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF). So there is no change in the osmolality of the ECF, and therefore no change in the ADH concentration of the plasma. However, low aldosterone levels cause a loss of sodium ions from the ECF, which could potentially cause a change in extracellular osmolality and therefore of ADH levels in the blood.\n\n===Potassium concentration===\n{{Main |Potassium#Homeostasis |Potassium in biology}}\nHigh potassium concentrations in the plasma cause [[depolarization]] of the [[zona glomerulosa]] cells' membranes in the outer layer of the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref name=\"pmid22546854\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu C, Rusin CG, Tan Z, Guagliardo NA, Barrett PQ |title=Zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal cortex are intrinsic electrical oscillators. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=2046\u20132053 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22546854 |doi=10.1172/JCI61996 |pmc=3966877}}</ref> This causes the release of [[aldosterone]] into the blood.\n\nAldosterone acts primarily on the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[collecting duct]]s of the kidneys, stimulating the excretion of potassium ions into the urine.<ref name=tortora3 /> It does so, however, by activating the [[basolateral]] [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps]] of the tubular epithelial cells.

[[Fluid balance]] involves keeping the fluid volume stabilized, and also keeping the levels of [[electrolyte]]s in the extracellular fluid stable. Fluid balance is maintained by the process of [[osmoregulation]] and by behavior. [[Osmotic pressure]] is detected by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[median preoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. Measurement of the plasma [[osmolality]] to give an indication of the water content of the body, relies on the fact that water losses from the body, (through [[Transepidermal water loss|unavoidable water loss through the skin]] which is not entirely waterproof and therefore always slightly moist, [[Breathing#Upper airways|water vapor in the exhaled air]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[vomiting]], normal [[feces]] and especially  [[diarrhea]]) are all [[hypotonic]], meaning that they are less salty than the body fluids (compare, for instance, the taste of saliva with that of tears. The latter has almost the same salt content as the extracellular fluid, whereas the former is hypotonic with respect to the plasma. Saliva does not taste salty, whereas tears are decidedly salty). Nearly all normal and abnormal losses of [[body water]] therefore cause the extracellular fluid to become [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]]. Conversely, excessive fluid intake dilutes the extracellular fluid causing the hypothalamus to register [[hypotonic hyponatremia]] conditions.\n\nWhen the [[hypothalamus]] detects a hypertonic extracellular environment, it causes the secretion of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) called [[vasopressin]] which acts on the effector organ, which in this case is the [[kidney]]. The effect of vasopressin on the kidney tubules is to reabsorb water from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[Collecting duct system|collecting ducts]], thus preventing aggravation of the water loss via the urine. The hypothalamus simultaneously stimulates the nearby [[Thirst|thirst center]] causing an almost irresistible (if the hypertonicity is severe enough) urge to drink water. The cessation of urine flow prevents the [[hypovolemia]] and [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonicity]] from getting worse; the drinking of water corrects the defect.\n\nHypo-osmolality results in very low plasma ADH levels. This results in the inhibition of water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, causing high volumes of very dilute urine to be excreted, thus getting rid of the excess water in the body.\n\nUrinary water loss, when the body water homeostat is intact, is a ''compensatory'' water loss, ''correcting'' any water excess in the body. However, since the kidneys cannot generate water, the thirst reflex is the all-important second effector mechanism of the body water homeostat, ''correcting'' any water deficit in the body.\n\n===Blood pH===\n[[File:2714_Respiratory_Regulation_of_Blood.jpg|border|right|364x364px]]\n{{Main|Acid\u2013base homeostasis |Acid-base imbalance}}\nThe [[pH#Living systems|plasma pH]] can be altered by respiratory changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide; or altered by metabolic changes in the [[carbonic acid]] to [[bicarbonate ion]] ratio. The [[bicarbonate buffer system]] regulates the ratio of carbonic acid  to bicarbonate to be equal to 1:20, at which ratio the blood pH is 7.4 (as explained in the [[Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation]]). A change in the plasma pH gives an [[acid\u2013base imbalance]].\nIn [[acid\u2013base homeostasis]] there are two mechanisms that can help regulate the pH. [[Respiratory compensation]] a mechanism of the [[respiratory center]], adjusts the [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] by changing the rate and depth of breathing, to bring the pH back to normal. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide also determines the concentration of carbonic acid, and the bicarbonate buffer system can also come into play. Renal compensation can help the bicarbonate buffer system.\nThe sensor for the plasma bicarbonate concentration is not known for certain. It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma.{{citation needed |date=November 2017}} The metabolism of these cells produces carbon dioxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen and bicarbonate through the action of [[carbonic anhydrase]].<ref name=tortora1 /> When the ECF pH falls (becoming more acidic) the renal tubular cells excrete hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid to leave the body via urine.

The resulting reaction in the plasma is the formation of carbonic acid which is in equilibrium with the plasma partial pressure of carbon dioxide.  This is tightly regulated to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of carbonic acid or bicarbonate. The overall effect is therefore that hydrogen ions are lost in the urine when the pH of the plasma falls. The concomitant rise in the plasma bicarbonate mops up the increased hydrogen ions (caused by the fall in plasma pH) and the resulting excess carbonic acid is disposed of in the lungs as carbon dioxide. This restores the normal ratio between bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and therefore the plasma pH.\nThe converse happens when a high plasma pH stimulates the kidneys to secrete hydrogen ions into the blood and to excrete bicarbonate into the urine.  The hydrogen ions combine with the excess bicarbonate ions in the plasma, once again forming an excess of carbonic acid which can be exhaled, as carbon dioxide, in the lungs, keeping the plasma bicarbonate ion concentration, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and, therefore, the plasma pH, constant.\n\n===Cerebrospinal fluid===\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) allows for regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sakka|first1=L.|last2=Coll|first2=G.|last3=Chazal|first3=J.|title=Anatomy and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid|journal=European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases|date=December 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1016/j.anorl.2011.03.002|pmid=22100360}}</ref> and [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system.

In this view, the entire planet maintains several homeostasis (the primary one being temperature homeostasis). Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is open to debate. However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, it is sometimes claimed that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, certain plants may be able to grow better and thus act to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, warming has exacerbated droughts, making water the actual [[limiting factor]] on land. When sunlight is plentiful and the atmospheric temperature climbs, it has been claimed that the [[phytoplankton]] of the ocean surface waters, acting as global sunshine, and therefore heat sensors, may thrive and produce more [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS). The DMS molecules act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]], which produce more clouds, and thus increase the atmospheric [[albedo]], and this feeds back to lower the temperature of the atmosphere. However, rising sea temperature has stratified the oceans, separating warm, sunlit waters from cool, nutrient-rich waters. Thus, nutrients have become the limiting factor, and plankton levels have actually fallen over the past 50 years, not risen. As scientists discover more about Earth, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered, that, together, maintain a metastable condition, sometimes within a very broad range of environmental conditions.\n\n==Predictive==\nPredictive homeostasis is an anticipatory response to an expected challenge in the future, such as the stimulation of insulin secretion by gut hormones which enter the blood in response to a meal.<ref name=koeslag /> This insulin secretion occurs before the blood sugar level rises, lowering the blood sugar level in anticipation of a large influx into the blood of glucose resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates in the gut.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach | year = 2009 | publisher = Saunders/Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 9781416031154 | edition=  2nd International | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Such anticipatory reactions are open loop systems which are based, essentially, on \"guess work\", and are not self-correcting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |last2=Saunders |first2=P.T. |last3=Wessels |first3=J.A. | title=Glucose homeostasis with infinite gain: further lessons from the Daisyworld parable? |journal= Journal of Endocrinology | date=1997 |volume=134 |pages=187\u2013192  }}</ref> Anticipatory responses always require a closed loop negative feedback system to correct the 'over-shoots' and 'under-shoots' to which the anticipatory systems are prone.\n\n==Other fields==\nThe term has come to be used in other fields, for example:\n\n===Risk===\n{{Main|Risk homeostasis}}\nAn [[actuary]] may refer to ''risk homeostasis'', where (for example) people who have anti-lock brakes have no better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits. Previous to the innovation of anti-lock brakes, certain maneuvers involved minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: Now the anti-lock system moves the boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer punitive area.

The term \"holy grail\" is often used to denote an elusive object or goal that is sought after for its great significance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of Holy Grail |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Holy%20Grail |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA \"grail\", wondrous but not explicitly holy, first appears in ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'', an unfinished [[Chivalric romance|romance]] written by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] around 1190. Chr\u00e9tien's story attracted many continuators, translators and interpreters in the later 12th and early 13th centuries, including [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who perceived the Grail as a stone. In the late 12th century, [[Robert de Boron]] wrote in ''Joseph d'Arimathie'' that the Grail was [[Jesus]]'s vessel from the [[Last Supper]], which [[Joseph of Arimathea]] used to catch [[Blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion]]. Thereafter, the Holy Grail became interwoven with the [[Holy Chalice]], the Last Supper cup, a theme continued in works such as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], as well as ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.<ref name=\"Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210\">Campbell 1990, p. 210.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|350x350px|[[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail.

The first concerns [[Knights of the Round Table|King Arthur's knights]] visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object. The second concerns the Grail's history in the time of [[Joseph of Arimathea]].\n\nThe nine works from the first group are:\n* ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]].\n* [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#The Continuations|Four Continuations]] of Chr\u00e9tien's poem, by authors of differing vision and talent, designed to bring the story to a close.\n* ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], which adapted at least the holiness of Robert's Grail into the framework of Chr\u00e9tien's story. In Wolfram's telling, the Grail was kept safe at the castle of [[Munsalvaesche]] (''mons salvationis''), entrusted to Titurel, the first Grail King. Some, not least the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks, have identified the castle with their real sanctuary of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]].\n* The Didot ''Perceval'', named after the manuscript's former owner, and purportedly a prosification of [[Robert de Boron]]'s sequel to ''Joseph d'Arimathie''.\n* [[Welsh romance]] ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'', a loose translation of Chr\u00e9tien's poem and the Continuations, with some influence from native Welsh literature. \n* ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', called the \"least canonical\" Grail romance because of its very different character.\n* German poem ''[[Diu Cr\u00f4ne]]'' (''The Crown''), in which [[Gawain]], rather than [[Percival]], achieves the Grail.\n* The ''Lancelot'' section of the vast [[Vulgate Cycle]] introduced the new Grail hero, [[Galahad]]. The ''Queste del Saint Graal'', a folow-up part of the cycle, concerns Galahad's eventual achievement of the Grail.\n\nOf the second group there are:\n*Robert de Boron's ''Joseph d'Arimathie.''\n* The ''Estoire del Saint Graal'', the first part of the Vulgate Cycle (but written after ''Lancelot'' and the ''Queste''), based on Robert's tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.\n* Verses by [[Rigaut de Berbezilh|Rigaut de Barbezieux]], a late 12th or early 13th-century<ref>Barber 2004, p. 418.</ref> Proven\u00e7al troubador, where mention is made of Perceval, the lance, and the Grail (\"Like Perceval when he lived, who stood amazed in contemplation, so that he was quite unable to ask what purpose the lance and grail served\" - \"''Attressi con Persavaus el temps que vivia, que s'esbait d'esgarder tant qu'anc non saup demandar de que servia la lansa ni-l grazaus''\"<ref>Sayce, Olive. ''Exemplary comparison from Homer to Petrarch'', DS Brewer, 2008, p. 143.</ref>).\n\nThe Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes.

Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 380.</ref> [[H\u00e9linand of Froidmont]] described a grail as a \"wide and deep saucer\" (''scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda''); other authors had their own ideas. Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the [[Last Supper]]. ''Peredur son of Efrawg'' had no Grail as such, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman's bloody, severed head.<ref>Guest, Lady Charlotte. ''The Mabinogion.

While dining in the magical abode of the [[Fisher King]], Perceval witnesses a wondrous procession in which youths carry magnificent objects from one chamber to another, passing before him at each course of the meal. First comes a young man carrying a bleeding lance, then two boys carrying candelabras. Finally, a beautiful young girl emerges bearing an elaborately decorated ''graal'', or \"grail\".<ref>Staines, David. (Trans.) ''The Complete Romances of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 379.</ref>\n\nChr\u00e9tien refers to this object not as \"The Grail\" but as \"a grail\" (''un graal''), showing the word was used, in its earliest literary context, as a common noun. For Chr\u00e9tien a grail was a wide, somewhat deep dish or bowl, interesting because it contained not a pike, salmon, or lamprey, as the audience may have expected for such a container, but a single [[Sacramental bread|Communion wafer]] which provided sustenance for the Fisher King's crippled father. Perceval, who had been warned against talking too much, remains silent through all of this and wakes up the next morning alone. He later learns that if he had asked the appropriate questions about what he saw, he would have healed his maimed host, much to his honour. The story of the Wounded King's [[inedia|mystical fasting]] is not unique; several saints were said to have lived without food besides communion, for instance Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]]. This may imply that Chr\u00e9tien intended the Communion wafer to be the significant part of the ritual, and the Grail to be a mere prop.<ref>Loomis 1991, p. 184.</ref>\n\n===Robert de Boron===\nThough Chr\u00e9tien's account is the earliest and most influential of all Grail texts, it was in the work of Robert de Boron that the Grail truly became the \"Holy Grail\" and assumed the form most familiar to modern readers in its Christian context.<ref>Weston 1993, p.161.</ref> In his verse romance ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', composed between 1191 and 1202, Robert tells the story of Joseph of Arimathea acquiring the chalice of the [[Last Supper]] to collect Christ's blood upon his removal from the cross. Joseph is thrown in prison, where Christ visits him and explains the mysteries of the blessed cup. Upon his release, Joseph gathers his in-laws and other followers and travels to the west. He founds a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.\n\n=== Lancelot-Grail ===\n[[File:Arthur Hughes - Sir Galahad.jpg|thumb|250px|''Sir Galahad, the Quest for the Holy Grail'' by [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] (1870)]]\n\nThe authors of the Vulgate Cycle used the Grail as a symbol of [[divine grace]]; Galahad, illegitimate son of [[Lancelot]] and [[Elaine of Corbenic|Elaine]], the world's greatest knight and the Grail Bearer at the castle of [[Corbenic]], is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a greater warrior than even his illustrious father.<ref>''The Quest of The Holy Grail'', translated by Matarasso, P.M., Penguin Books, 1969, page 60.</ref> The ''Queste del Saint Graal'' (''The Quest of The Holy Grail'') tells also of the adventures of various [[Knights of the Round Table]] in their eponymous quest, some of them including Percival as Galahad's on-and-off companions. Galahad and the interpretation of the Grail involving him were picked up in the 15th century by Thomas Malory in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and remain popular today.<ref>Malory, Sir Thomas, ''Le Morte D\u2019Arthur'', Penguin Books, 1969, Volume II, page 256.</ref>\n\n===Wolfram von Eschenbach===\nIn ''Parzival'', Wolfram von Eschenbach, citing the authority of a certain (probably fictional) [[Kyot|Kyot the Proven\u00e7al]], claimed the Grail was a Stone, the sanctuary of the neutral angels who took neither side during [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion.

Penguin Books, 1980, page 239.</ref>\n\n===Scholarly hypotheses===\nScholars have long speculated on the origins of the Holy Grail before Chr\u00e9tien, suggesting that it may contain elements of the trope of magical cauldrons from [[Celtic mythology]] and later [[Welsh mythology]] combined with Christian legend surrounding the [[Eucharist]],<ref>Weston 1993, p. 74, 129.</ref> the latter found in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] sources, conceivably in that of the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine Mass]], or even Persian sources.<ref>Jung, Emma and von Franz, Marie-Louise. ''The Grail Legend'', Sigo Press, Boston, 1980, p. 14.</ref> The view that the \"origin\" of the Grail legend should be seen as deriving from Celtic mythology was championed by [[Roger Sherman Loomis]], [[Alfred Nutt]] and [[Jessie Weston]]. Loomis traced a number of parallels between [[Medieval Welsh literature]] and Irish material and the Grail romances, including similarities between the ''[[Mabinogion]]''{{'}}s [[Bran the Blessed]] and the Arthurian Fisher King, and between Bran's life-restoring cauldron and the Grail.\n\nThe opposing view dismissed the \"Celtic\" connections as spurious and interpreted the legend as essentially Christian in origin. Joseph Goering has identified sources for Grail imagery in 12th-century wall paintings from churches in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Pyrenees]] (now mostly removed to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]), which present unique iconic images of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a bowl that radiates tongues of fire, images that predate the first literary account by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes. Goering argues that they were the original inspiration for the Grail legend.<ref>Goering, Joseph (2005). ''The Virgin and the Grail: Origins of a Legend''.

These artifacts are said to have been the vessel used at the Last Supper, but other details vary. Despite the prominence of the Grail literature, traditions about a Last Supper relic remained rare in contrast to other items associated with Jesus' last days, such as the [[True Cross]] and [[Holy Lance]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\">Wood 2012, p. 91.</ref>\n\nOne tradition predates the Grail romances: in the 7th century, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] reported that the Last Supper chalice was displayed near Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\"/><ref>Barber 2004, p. 167.</ref> In the wake of Robert de Boron's Grail works, several other items came to be claimed as the true Last Supper vessel. In the late 12th century, one was said to be in [[Byzantium]]; [[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]]'s Grail romance ''[[Der J\u00fcngere Titurel]]'' associated it explicitly with the Arthurian Grail, but claimed it was only a copy.<ref name=barber93/> This item was said to have been looted in the [[Fourth Crusade]] and brought to [[Troyes]] in France, but it was lost during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\">Wood 2012, p. 94.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 168.</ref>\n\nTwo relics associated with the Grail survive today. The ''Sacro Catino'' (Sacred Basin, also known as the Genoa Chalice) is a green glass dish held at the [[Genoa Cathedral]] said to have been used at the Last Supper. Its provenance is unknown, and there are two divergent accounts of how it was brought to Genoa by [[Caesarea Maritima#Crusades|Crusaders]] in the 12th century. It was not associated with the Last Supper until later, in the wake of the Grail romances; the first known association is in [[Jacobus da Varagine]]'s chronicle of Genoa in the late 13th century, which draws on the Grail literary tradition. The Catino was moved and broken during [[Napoleon]]'s conquest in the early 19th century, revealing that it is glass rather than emerald.<ref name=barber93/><ref>Wood 2012, p. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe Holy Chalice of [[Valencia]] is an [[agate]] dish with a mounting for use as a chalice. The bowl may date to [[Greco-Roman]] times, but its dating is unclear, and its provenance is unknown before 1399, when it was gifted to [[Martin I of Aragon]]. By the 14th century an elaborate tradition had developed that this object was the Last Supper chalice. This tradition mirrors aspects of the Grail material, with several major differences, suggesting a separate tradition entirely. It is not associated with Joseph of Arimathea or Jesus' blood; it is said to have been taken to Rome by [[Saint Peter]] and later entrusted to [[Saint Lawrence]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95\u201396.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 169\u2013170.</ref> Early references do not call the object the \"Grail\"; the first evidence connecting it to the Grail tradition is from the 15th century.<ref>Barber 2004, p. 170.</ref> The monarchy sold the cup in the 15th century to [[Valencia Cathedral]], where it remains a significant local icon.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95.</ref>\n\nSeveral objects were identified with the Holy Grail in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\"/> In the 20th century, a series of new items became associated with it. These include the [[Nanteos Cup]], a medieval wooden bowl found near [[Rhydyfelin]], Wales; a glass dish found near [[Glastonbury]], England; and the [[Antioch chalice]], a 6th-century [[silver-gilt]] object that became attached to the Grail legend in the 1930s.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\n===Locations associated with the Holy Grail===\n[[File:Hans Thoma - Die Gralsburg.jpg|thumb|''Die Gralsburg'' (''The Grail Castle'') by [[Hans Thoma]] (1899)]]\n\nIn the modern era, a number of places have become associated with the Holy Grail. One of the most prominent is [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], England. Glastonbury was associated with King Arthur and his resting place of [[Avalon]] by the 12th century.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 51\u201352.</ref> In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 53\u201355.</ref> Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 55\u201360.</ref> In the late 19th century, [[John Goodchild]] hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]], retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 57\u201358.</ref> Glastonbury and its Holy Grail legend have since become a point of focus for various [[New Age]] and [[Neopagan]] groups.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 58\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, esoteric writers identified [[Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur|Monts\u00e9gur]], a stronghold of the heretical [[Cathar]] sect in the 13th century, as the Grail castle. Similarly, the 14th-century [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Midlothian]], Scotland, became attached to the Grail legend in the mid-20th century when a succession of conspiracy books identified it as a secret hiding place of the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, pp. 75\u201376, 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n==Modern interpretations==\n===Pseudohistory and conspiracy theories===\nSince the 19th century, the Holy Grail has been linked to various conspiracy theories. In 1818, Austrian pseudohistorical writer [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] connected the Grail to contemporary myths surrounding the [[Knights Templar]] that cast the order as a secret society dedicated to mystical knowledge and relics. In Hammer-Purgstall's work, the Grail is not a physical relic but a symbol of the secret knowledge that the Templars sought. There is no historical evidence linking the Templars to a search for the Grail, but subsequent writers have elaborated on the Templar theories.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 70, 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 20th century, writers, particularly in France, further connected the Templars and Grail to the Cathars. In 1906, French esoteric writer [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]] identified the Cathar castle of Monts\u00e9gur with [[Munsalv\u00e4sche]] or Montsalvat, the Grail castle in Wolfram's ''Parzival''. This identification has inspired a wider legend asserting that the Cathars possessed the Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 75\u201376.</ref> According to these stories, the Cathars guarded the Grail at Monts\u00e9gur, and smuggled it out when the castle fell in 1244.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n[[File:Parsifal1933.jpg|thumb|The Grail in 1933 German stamp]]\n\nBeginning in 1933, German writer [[Otto Rahn]] published a series of books tying the Grail, Templars, and Cathars to modern German nationalist mythology. According to Rahn, the Grail was a symbol of a pure Germanic religion repressed by Christianity. Rahn's books inspired interest in the Grail in [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]] and led to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s abortive sponsorship of Rahn's search for the Grail, as well as many subsequent conspiracy theories and fictional works about the Nazis searching for the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, writers [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]] created one of the most widely known conspiracy theories about the Holy Grail. The theory first appeared in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'' in the 1970s, and was elaborated upon in the bestselling 1982 book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''.<ref name=Wood77/> The theory combines myths about the Templars and Cathars with various other legends and a prominent [[hoax]] about a secret order called the [[Priory of Sion]]. According to this theory, the Holy Grail is not a physical object, but a symbol of the [[bloodline of Jesus]]. The blood connection is based on the etymology reading ''san greal'' (holy grail) as ''sang real'' (royal blood), which dates to the 15th century.<ref name=Wood77/> The narrative developed here is that [[Jesus]] was not divine, and had children with [[Mary Magdalene]], who took the family to France where their descendants became the [[Merovingians]] dynasty. While the Catholic Church worked to destroy the dynasty, they were protected by the Priory of Sion and their associates, including the Templars, Cathars, and other secret societies.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77\u201382.</ref> The book, its arguments, and its evidence have been widely criticized by scholars, but it has had a vast influence on conspiracy and [[alternate history]] books. It has also inspired fiction, most notably [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and its 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77, 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n===Music and painting===\n[[File:Frederick Sandys - King Pelles Daughter.jpg|thumb|upright|''King Pelles' Daughter Bearing the Sancgraal'' by [[Frederick Sandys]] (1861)|alt=]]\n\nThe combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in [[Richard Wagner]]'s final music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the grail \u2013 now periodically producing blood \u2013 directly with female fertility.<ref>Donington, Robert (1963).

A sexualised interpretation of the grail, now identified with female genitalia, appeared in 1870 in [[Hargrave Jennings]]' book ''The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries''.<ref>Writing of the Order of the Garter ceremonies Jennings writes on page 323:- The whole refers to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table; set round as sentinels ('in lodge') of the Sangreal, or Holy Graal--the 'Sacrifice Mysterious', or 'Eucharist'. But how is all this magic and sacred in the estimate of the Rosicrucians?' an inquirer will very naturally ask. The answer to all this is very, ample and satisfactory; but particulars must be left to the sagacity of the querist himself, because propriety does not admit of explanation. Suffice it to say, that it is one of the most curious and wonderful subjects which has occupied the attention of antiquaries. That archaeological puzzle, the 'Round Table of King Arthur', is a perfect display of this whole subject of the origin of the 'Garter'; it springs directly from it, being the same object as that enclosed by the mythic garter, 'garder', or 'girther.'</ref>\n\n* [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) loosely follows the legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King combined with vignettes of contemporary British society. In his first note to the poem Eliot attributes the title to [[Jessie L. Weston]]'s book on the Grail legend, ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''. The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King and the subsequent sterility of his lands. A poem of the same title, though otherwise dissimilar, written by [[Madison Cawein]], was published in 1913 in [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/4|title=January 1913 : Poetry Magazine|publisher=Poetryfoundation.org|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n* In [[John Cowper Powys]]'s ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' (1932) the \"heroine is the Grail,\"<ref>\"Preface\" to ''A Glastonbury Romance''.

In Brown's novel, it is hinted that this Grail was long buried beneath [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in Scotland, but that in recent decades its guardians had it moved to a secret chamber embedded in the floor beneath the [[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|Inverted Pyramid]] in the entrance of the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]].\n* [[Michael Moorcock]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The War Hound and the World's Pain]]'' (1981) depicts a supernatural Grail quest set in the era of the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n*German history and fantasy novel author [[Rainer M.

In the third book, ''Das Labyrinth der schwarzen Abtei'' (2007), the four heroes must reunite to smuggle the Holy Grail out of the Temple in Paris after the fall of the Knights Templar 1307, again pursued by the Iscarians (who in the novel used the King's animosity against the Templars to their advantage). Interestingly, Schr\u00f6der also indirectily addresses the Cathar Theory by letting the four heroes encounter Cathars - among them old friends from their flight from Acco - on their way to Portugal to seek refuge with the King of Portugal and travel further west.\n* The 15th novel in ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' series by [[Jim Butcher]], [[Skin Game (The Dresden Files)|''Skin Game'']] (2014), features [[Harry Dresden]] being recruited by Denarian and longtime enemy Nichodemus into a heist team seeking to retrieve the Holy Grail from the vault of [[Hades]], the lord of the Underworld.

Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance, often in the custody of the [[Fisher King]]. The term \"holy grail\" is often used to denote an elusive object or goal that is sought after for its great significance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of Holy Grail |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Holy%20Grail |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA \"grail\", wondrous but not explicitly holy, first appears in ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'', an unfinished [[Chivalric romance|romance]] written by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] around 1190. Chr\u00e9tien's story attracted many continuators, translators and interpreters in the later 12th and early 13th centuries, including [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who perceived the Grail as a stone. In the late 12th century, [[Robert de Boron]] wrote in ''Joseph d'Arimathie'' that the Grail was [[Jesus]]'s vessel from the [[Last Supper]], which [[Joseph of Arimathea]] used to catch [[Blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion]]. Thereafter, the Holy Grail became interwoven with the legend of the [[Holy Chalice]], the Last Supper cup, a theme continued in works such as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], as well as ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.<ref name=\"Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210\">Campbell 1990, p. 210.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|350x350px|[[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail.

The first concerns [[Knights of the Round Table|King Arthur's knights]] visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object. The second concerns the Grail's history in the time of [[Joseph of Arimathea]].\n\nThe nine works from the first group are:\n* ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]].\n* [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#The Continuations|Four Continuations]] of Chr\u00e9tien's poem, by authors of differing vision and talent, designed to bring the story to a close.\n* ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], which adapted at least the holiness of Robert's Grail into the framework of Chr\u00e9tien's story. In Wolfram's telling, the Grail was kept safe at the castle of [[Munsalvaesche]] (''mons salvationis''), entrusted to Titurel, the first Grail King. Some, not least the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks, have identified the castle with their real sanctuary of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]].\n* The Didot ''Perceval'', named after the manuscript's former owner, and purportedly a prosification of [[Robert de Boron]]'s sequel to ''Joseph d'Arimathie''.\n* [[Welsh romance]] ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'', a loose translation of Chr\u00e9tien's poem and the Continuations, with some influence from native Welsh literature. \n* ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', called the \"least canonical\" Grail romance because of its very different character.\n* German poem ''[[Diu Cr\u00f4ne]]'' (''The Crown''), in which [[Gawain]], rather than [[Percival]], achieves the Grail.\n* The ''Lancelot'' section of the vast [[Vulgate Cycle]] introduced the new Grail hero, [[Galahad]]. The ''Queste del Saint Graal'', a folow-up part of the cycle, concerns Galahad's eventual achievement of the Grail.\n\nOf the second group there are:\n*Robert de Boron's ''Joseph d'Arimathie.''\n* The ''Estoire del Saint Graal'', the first part of the Vulgate Cycle (but written after ''Lancelot'' and the ''Queste''), based on Robert's tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.\n* Verses by [[Rigaut de Berbezilh|Rigaut de Barbezieux]], a late 12th or early 13th-century<ref>Barber 2004, p. 418.</ref> Proven\u00e7al troubador, where mention is made of Perceval, the lance, and the Grail (\"Like Perceval when he lived, who stood amazed in contemplation, so that he was quite unable to ask what purpose the lance and grail served\" - \"''Attressi con Persavaus el temps que vivia, que s'esbait d'esgarder tant qu'anc non saup demandar de que servia la lansa ni-l grazaus''\"<ref>Sayce, Olive. ''Exemplary comparison from Homer to Petrarch'', DS Brewer, 2008, p. 143.</ref>).\n\nThe Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes.

Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 380.</ref> [[H\u00e9linand of Froidmont]] described a grail as a \"wide and deep saucer\" (''scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda''); other authors had their own ideas. Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the [[Last Supper]]. ''Peredur son of Efrawg'' had no Grail as such, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman's bloody, severed head.<ref>Guest, Lady Charlotte. ''The Mabinogion.

While dining in the magical abode of the [[Fisher King]], Perceval witnesses a wondrous procession in which youths carry magnificent objects from one chamber to another, passing before him at each course of the meal. First comes a young man carrying a bleeding lance, then two boys carrying candelabras. Finally, a beautiful young girl emerges bearing an elaborately decorated ''graal'', or \"grail\".<ref>Staines, David. (Trans.) ''The Complete Romances of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 379.</ref>\n\nChr\u00e9tien refers to this object not as \"The Grail\" but as \"a grail\" (''un graal''), showing the word was used, in its earliest literary context, as a common noun. For Chr\u00e9tien a grail was a wide, somewhat deep dish or bowl, interesting because it contained not a pike, salmon, or lamprey, as the audience may have expected for such a container, but a single [[Sacramental bread|Communion wafer]] which provided sustenance for the Fisher King's crippled father. Perceval, who had been warned against talking too much, remains silent through all of this and wakes up the next morning alone. He later learns that if he had asked the appropriate questions about what he saw, he would have healed his maimed host, much to his honour. The story of the Wounded King's [[inedia|mystical fasting]] is not unique; several saints were said to have lived without food besides communion, for instance Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]]. This may imply that Chr\u00e9tien intended the Communion wafer to be the significant part of the ritual, and the Grail to be a mere prop.<ref>Loomis 1991, p. 184.</ref>\n\n===Robert de Boron===\nThough Chr\u00e9tien's account is the earliest and most influential of all Grail texts, it was in the work of Robert de Boron that the Grail truly became the \"Holy Grail\" and assumed the form most familiar to modern readers in its Christian context.<ref>Weston 1993, p.161.</ref> In his verse romance ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', composed between 1191 and 1202, Robert tells the story of Joseph of Arimathea acquiring the chalice of the [[Last Supper]] to collect Christ's blood upon his removal from the cross. Joseph is thrown in prison, where Christ visits him and explains the mysteries of the blessed cup. Upon his release, Joseph gathers his in-laws and other followers and travels to the west. He founds a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.\n\n=== Lancelot-Grail ===\n[[File:Arthur Hughes - Sir Galahad.jpg|thumb|250px|''Sir Galahad, the Quest for the Holy Grail'' by [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] (1870)]]\n\nThe authors of the Vulgate Cycle used the Grail as a symbol of [[divine grace]]; Galahad, illegitimate son of [[Lancelot]] and [[Elaine of Corbenic|Elaine]], the world's greatest knight and the Grail Bearer at the castle of [[Corbenic]], is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a greater warrior than even his illustrious father.<ref>''The Quest of The Holy Grail'', translated by Matarasso, P.M., Penguin Books, 1969, page 60.</ref> The ''Queste del Saint Graal'' (''The Quest of The Holy Grail'') tells also of the adventures of various [[Knights of the Round Table]] in their eponymous quest, some of them including Percival as Galahad's on-and-off companions.

Penguin Books, 1980, page 239.</ref>\n\n===Scholarly hypotheses===\nScholars have long speculated on the origins of the Holy Grail before Chr\u00e9tien, suggesting that it may contain elements of the trope of magical cauldrons from [[Celtic mythology]] and later [[Welsh mythology]] combined with Christian legend surrounding the [[Eucharist]],<ref>Weston 1993, p. 74, 129.</ref> the latter found in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] sources, conceivably in that of the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine Mass]], or even Persian sources.<ref>Jung, Emma and von Franz, Marie-Louise. ''The Grail Legend'', Sigo Press, Boston, 1980, p. 14.</ref> The view that the \"origin\" of the Grail legend should be seen as deriving from Celtic mythology was championed by [[Roger Sherman Loomis]], [[Alfred Nutt]] and [[Jessie Weston]]. Loomis traced a number of parallels between [[Medieval Welsh literature]] and Irish material and the Grail romances, including similarities between the ''[[Mabinogion]]''{{'}}s [[Bran the Blessed]] and the Arthurian Fisher King, and between Bran's life-restoring cauldron and the Grail.\n\nThe opposing view dismissed the \"Celtic\" connections as spurious and interpreted the legend as essentially Christian in origin. Joseph Goering has identified sources for Grail imagery in 12th-century wall paintings from churches in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Pyrenees]] (now mostly removed to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]), which present unique iconic images of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a bowl that radiates tongues of fire, images that predate the first literary account by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes.

These artifacts are said to have been the vessel used at the Last Supper, but other details vary. Despite the prominence of the Grail literature, traditions about a Last Supper relic remained rare in contrast to other items associated with Jesus' last days, such as the [[True Cross]] and [[Holy Lance]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\">Wood 2012, p. 91.</ref>\n\nOne tradition predates the Grail romances: in the 7th century, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] reported that the Last Supper chalice was displayed near Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\"/><ref>Barber 2004, p. 167.</ref> In the wake of Robert de Boron's Grail works, several other items came to be claimed as the true Last Supper vessel. In the late 12th century, one was said to be in [[Byzantium]]; [[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]]'s Grail romance ''[[Der J\u00fcngere Titurel]]'' associated it explicitly with the Arthurian Grail, but claimed it was only a copy.<ref name=barber93/> This item was said to have been looted in the [[Fourth Crusade]] and brought to [[Troyes]] in France, but it was lost during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\">Wood 2012, p. 94.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 168.</ref>\n\nTwo relics associated with the Grail survive today. The ''Sacro Catino'' (Sacred Basin, also known as the Genoa Chalice) is a green glass dish held at the [[Genoa Cathedral]] said to have been used at the Last Supper. Its provenance is unknown, and there are two divergent accounts of how it was brought to Genoa by [[Caesarea Maritima#Crusades|Crusaders]] in the 12th century. It was not associated with the Last Supper until later, in the wake of the Grail romances; the first known association is in [[Jacobus da Varagine]]'s chronicle of Genoa in the late 13th century, which draws on the Grail literary tradition. The Catino was moved and broken during [[Napoleon]]'s conquest in the early 19th century, revealing that it is glass rather than emerald.<ref name=barber93/><ref>Wood 2012, p. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe Holy Chalice of [[Valencia]] is an [[agate]] dish with a mounting for use as a chalice. The bowl may date to [[Greco-Roman]] times, but its dating is unclear, and its provenance is unknown before 1399, when it was gifted to [[Martin I of Aragon]]. By the 14th century an elaborate tradition had developed that this object was the Last Supper chalice. This tradition mirrors aspects of the Grail material, with several major differences, suggesting a separate tradition entirely. It is not associated with Joseph of Arimathea or Jesus' blood; it is said to have been taken to Rome by [[Saint Peter]] and later entrusted to [[Saint Lawrence]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95\u201396.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 169\u2013170.</ref> Early references do not call the object the \"Grail\"; the first evidence connecting it to the Grail tradition is from the 15th century.<ref>Barber 2004, p. 170.</ref> The monarchy sold the cup in the 15th century to [[Valencia Cathedral]], where it remains a significant local icon.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95.</ref>\n\nSeveral objects were identified with the Holy Grail in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\"/> In the 20th century, a series of new items became associated with it. These include the [[Nanteos Cup]], a medieval wooden bowl found near [[Rhydyfelin]], Wales; a glass dish found near [[Glastonbury]], England; and the [[Antioch chalice]], a 6th-century [[silver-gilt]] object that became attached to the Grail legend in the 1930s.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\n===Locations associated with the Holy Grail===\n[[File:Hans Thoma - Die Gralsburg.jpg|thumb|''Die Gralsburg'' (''The Grail Castle'') by [[Hans Thoma]] (1899)]]\n\nIn the modern era, a number of places have become associated with the Holy Grail. One of the most prominent is [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], England. Glastonbury was associated with King Arthur and his resting place of [[Avalon]] by the 12th century.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 51\u201352.</ref> In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 53\u201355.</ref> Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 55\u201360.</ref> In the late 19th century, [[John Goodchild]] hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]], retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 57\u201358.</ref> Glastonbury and its Holy Grail legend have since become a point of focus for various [[New Age]] and [[Neopagan]] groups.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 58\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, esoteric writers identified [[Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur|Monts\u00e9gur]], a stronghold of the heretical [[Cathar]] sect in the 13th century, as the Grail castle. Similarly, the 14th-century [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Midlothian]], Scotland, became attached to the Grail legend in the mid-20th century when a succession of conspiracy books identified it as a secret hiding place of the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, pp. 75\u201376, 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n==Modern interpretations==\n===Pseudohistory and conspiracy theories===\nSince the 19th century, the Holy Grail has been linked to various conspiracy theories. In 1818, Austrian pseudohistorical writer [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] connected the Grail to contemporary myths surrounding the [[Knights Templar]] that cast the order as a secret society dedicated to mystical knowledge and relics. In Hammer-Purgstall's work, the Grail is not a physical relic but a symbol of the secret knowledge that the Templars sought. There is no historical evidence linking the Templars to a search for the Grail, but subsequent writers have elaborated on the Templar theories.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 70, 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 20th century, writers, particularly in France, further connected the Templars and Grail to the Cathars. In 1906, French esoteric writer [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]] identified the Cathar castle of Monts\u00e9gur with [[Munsalv\u00e4sche]] or Montsalvat, the Grail castle in Wolfram's ''Parzival''. This identification has inspired a wider legend asserting that the Cathars possessed the Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 75\u201376.</ref> According to these stories, the Cathars guarded the Grail at Monts\u00e9gur, and smuggled it out when the castle fell in 1244.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n[[File:Parsifal1933.jpg|thumb|The Grail in 1933 German stamp]]\n\nBeginning in 1933, German writer [[Otto Rahn]] published a series of books tying the Grail, Templars, and Cathars to modern German nationalist mythology. According to Rahn, the Grail was a symbol of a pure Germanic religion repressed by Christianity. Rahn's books inspired interest in the Grail in [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]] and led to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s abortive sponsorship of Rahn's search for the Grail, as well as many subsequent conspiracy theories and fictional works about the Nazis searching for the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, writers [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]] created one of the most widely known conspiracy theories about the Holy Grail. The theory first appeared in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'' in the 1970s, and was elaborated upon in the bestselling 1982 book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''.<ref name=Wood77/> The theory combines myths about the Templars and Cathars with various other legends and a prominent [[hoax]] about a secret order called the [[Priory of Sion]]. According to this theory, the Holy Grail is not a physical object, but a symbol of the [[bloodline of Jesus]]. The blood connection is based on the etymology reading ''san greal'' (holy grail) as ''sang real'' (royal blood), which dates to the 15th century.<ref name=Wood77/> The narrative developed here is that [[Jesus]] was not divine, and had children with [[Mary Magdalene]], who took the family to France where their descendants became the [[Merovingians]] dynasty. While the Catholic Church worked to destroy the dynasty, they were protected by the Priory of Sion and their associates, including the Templars, Cathars, and other secret societies.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77\u201382.</ref> The book, its arguments, and its evidence have been widely criticized by scholars, but it has had a vast influence on conspiracy and [[alternate history]] books. It has also inspired fiction, most notably [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and its 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77, 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n===Music and painting===\n[[File:Frederick Sandys - King Pelles Daughter.jpg|thumb|upright|''King Pelles' Daughter Bearing the Sancgraal'' by [[Frederick Sandys]] (1861)|alt=]]\n\nThe combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in [[Richard Wagner]]'s final music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the grail \u2013 now periodically producing blood \u2013 directly with female fertility.<ref>Donington, Robert (1963).

''Culture and the King: The Social Implications of the Arthurian Legend'', SUNY Press, Albany, N.Y., 1994, p. 264.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\nThe story of the Grail and of the quest to find it became increasingly popular in the 19th century, referred to in literature such as [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s Arthurian cycle ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. A sexualised interpretation of the grail, now identified with female genitalia, appeared in 1870 in [[Hargrave Jennings]]' book ''The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries''.<ref>Writing of the Order of the Garter ceremonies Jennings writes on page 323:- The whole refers to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table; set round as sentinels ('in lodge') of the Sangreal, or Holy Graal--the 'Sacrifice Mysterious', or 'Eucharist'. But how is all this magic and sacred in the estimate of the Rosicrucians?' an inquirer will very naturally ask. The answer to all this is very, ample and satisfactory; but particulars must be left to the sagacity of the querist himself, because propriety does not admit of explanation. Suffice it to say, that it is one of the most curious and wonderful subjects which has occupied the attention of antiquaries. That archaeological puzzle, the 'Round Table of King Arthur', is a perfect display of this whole subject of the origin of the 'Garter'; it springs directly from it, being the same object as that enclosed by the mythic garter, 'garder', or 'girther.'</ref>\n\n* [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) loosely follows the legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King combined with vignettes of contemporary British society. In his first note to the poem Eliot attributes the title to [[Jessie L. Weston]]'s book on the Grail legend, ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''. The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King and the subsequent sterility of his lands. A poem of the same title, though otherwise dissimilar, written by [[Madison Cawein]], was published in 1913 in [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/4|title=January 1913 : Poetry Magazine|publisher=Poetryfoundation.org|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n* In [[John Cowper Powys]]'s ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' (1932) the \"heroine is the Grail,\"<ref>\"Preface\" to ''A Glastonbury Romance''.

Costain]].\n* A quest for the Grail appears in [[Nelson DeMille]]'s adventure novel ''The Quest'' (1975), set during the 1970s.\n* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s Arthurian revisionist fantasy novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' (1983) presented the Grail as a symbol of water, part of a set of objects representing the four [[classical elements]]. \n* The main theme of [[Rosalind Miles]]' ''Child of the Holy Grail'' (2000) in her ''Guenevere'' series is the story of the Grail quest by the 14-year-old Galahad.\n* The Grail motif features heavily in [[Umberto Eco]]'s 2000 novel ''[[Baudolino]]'', set in the 12th century.\n* It is the subject of [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s historical fiction series of books ''[[The Grail Quest]]'' (2000-2012), set during the [[Hundred Years War]].\n* Influenced by the 1982 publication of the ostensibly non-fiction ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Dan Brown's ''The Da Vinci Code'' (2003) has the \"grail\"  taken to refer to Mary Magdalene as the \"receptacle\" of Jesus' bloodline (playing on the ''sang real'' etymology). In Brown's novel, it is hinted that this Grail was long buried beneath [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in Scotland, but that in recent decades its guardians had it moved to a secret chamber embedded in the floor beneath the [[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|Inverted Pyramid]] in the entrance of the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]].\n* [[Michael Moorcock]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The War Hound and the World's Pain]]'' (1981) depicts a supernatural Grail quest set in the era of the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n*German history and fantasy novel author [[Rainer M. Schr\u00f6der]] wrote the trilogy ''[[:de:Die Bruderschaft vom Heiligen Gral|Die Bruderschaft vom Heiligen Gral]]'' (The Brotherhood of the Holy Grail) about a group of four Knights Templar who save the Grail from the Fall of Acco 1291 and go through an Odyssey to bring it to the Temple in Paris in the first two books, ''Der Fall von Akkon'' (2006) and ''Das Amulett der W\u00fcstenkrieger'' (2006), while defending the holy relic from the attempts of a satanic sect called Iscarians to steal it. In the third book, ''Das Labyrinth der schwarzen Abtei'' (2007), the four heroes must reunite to smuggle the Holy Grail out of the Temple in Paris after the fall of the Knights Templar 1307, again pursued by the Iscarians (who in the novel used the King's animosity against the Templars to their advantage). Interestingly, Schr\u00f6der also indirectily addresses the Cathar Theory by letting the four heroes encounter Cathars - among them old friends from their flight from Acco - on their way to Portugal to seek refuge with the King of Portugal and travel further west.\n* The 15th novel in ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' series by [[Jim Butcher]], [[Skin Game (The Dresden Files)|''Skin Game'']] (2014), features [[Harry Dresden]] being recruited by Denarian and longtime enemy Nichodemus into a heist team seeking to retrieve the Holy Grail from the vault of [[Hades]], the lord of the Underworld. The properties of the item are not explicit, but the relic itself makes an appearance and is in the hands of Nichodemus by the end of the novel's events.\n\n===Film and other media===\n[[File:Hollywood Museum - Indiana Jones' Grail Diary (7659583966).jpg|thumb|Grail diary of [[Henry Jones, Sr.]] from the 1989 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' at the [[Hollywood Museum]]]]\n\nIn the cinema, the Holy Grail debuted in the 1904 silent film ''[[Parsifal (1904 film)|Parsifal]]'', an adaptation of Wagner's opera by [[Edwin S. Porter]]. More recent cinematic adaptations include Costain's ''The Silver Chalice'' made into a [[The Silver Chalice (film)|1954 film]] by [[Victor Saville]] and Brown's ''The Da Vinci Code'' turned into a [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|2006 film]] by [[Ron Howard]].\n\n* The silent drama film ''[[The Light in the Dark]]'' (1922) involves discovery of the Grail in modern times.\n*[[Robert Bresson]]'s fantasy film ''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'' (1974) includes a more realistic version of the Grail quest from Arthurian romances.\n* ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) is a comedic take on the Arthurian Grail quest, adapted in 2004 as the stage production ''[[Spamalot]]''. \n* [[John Boorman]], in his fantasy film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), attempted to restore a more traditional heroic representation of an Arthurian tale, in which the Grail is revealed as a mystical means to revitalise Arthur and the barren land to which his depressive sickness is connected.\n*[[Steven Spielberg]]'s adventure film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989) features [[Indiana Jones]] and [[Henry Jones, Sr.|his father]] in a race for the Grail against the Nazis.\n*[[Terry Gilliam]]'s comedy-drama film ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991) features the Grail quest in the modern New York City.\n*In the season one episode \"[[Grail (Babylon 5)|Grail]]\" (1994) of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', a man named Aldous Gajic visits Babylon 5 in his continuing quest to find the Holy Grail. His quest is primarily a plot device, as the episode's action revolves not around the quest but rather around his presence and impact on the life of a station resident.\n* A science fiction version of the Grail Quest is central theme in the [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|''Stargate SG-1'' season 10]] episode \"The Quest\" (2006).\n*In the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'' (2016), the Holy Grail is the Treasure of the game's final Palace, representing the combined desires of all of humanity for a higher power to take control their lives and make a world that has no sense of individuality.\n* In the television series [[Knightfall (TV series)|''Knightfall'']] (2017), the search for the Holy Grail by the Knights Templar is a major theme of the series' first season. The Grail, which appears as a simple earthenware cup, is coveted by various factions including the Pope, who thinks that possession of it will enable him to ignite another Crusade.\n* In the ''[[Fate/stay night|Fate]]'' franchise, the Holy Grail serves as the prize of the Holy Grail War, granting a single wish to the victor of the battle royale. However, it's hinted at throughout the series that this Grail is not the real chalice of Christ, but is actually an item of uncertain nature created by mages some generations ago.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Akshaya Patra]] (Hindu mythology)\n* [[Arma Christi]]\n* [[Cornucopia]] (Greek mythology)\n* [[Cup of Jamshid]] (Persian mythology)\n*[[Fairy cup legend]]\n* [[Holy Chalice]] (Christian mythology)\n* [[List of mythological objects]]\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n* [[Sampo]] (Finnish mythology)\n* [[Salsabil]] \n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Barber, Richard (2004).

His absent father is supposedly serving on the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]] but has lost all contact, and his older sister Inge has recently died of [[influenza]]. The [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] Jojo often talks with his [[imaginary friend]], Adolf, a supportive and buffoonish version of [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nNow aged ten, it is time for Jojo to join the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]''. He attends his first [[Hitler Youth]] training camp with his best friend, Yorki, run by the one-eyed ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Captain Klenzendorf and assisted by Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm, where Jojo receives a knife. When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he tries to release it. The older boys snap its neck, and Jojo runs off crying after the other boys taunt him with the name \"Jojo Rabbit\". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns, stealing a ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'' and throwing it without permission in an effort to prove his bravery. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial and body scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, his mother coerces Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included, despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading [[propaganda]] leaflets throughout the town, and collecting [[scrap]] for the war effort.\n\nAlone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister's former classmate, hiding upstairs. Elsa reacts aggressively on their first encounter, pinning him against a wall and taking the knife issued to him as a member of Hitler Youth. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the [[Gestapo]], but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her, and threatens to kill him if he tells his mother. Intimidated, Jojo agrees to keep her safe, but soon afterwards returns and asks that she reveal her \"[[Antisemitic canard|Jew secrets]]\" so he can write a book about Jews for Klenzendorf, which amuses her. Elsa plays along by making up stories about Jewish powers, such as [[Telepathy|mind-reading]]. Angry with his mother for hiding a Jew but unable to reveal his knowledge of Elsa, Jojo accuses Rosie of being unpatriotic and laments that his father is away. Rosie dismisses his accusations and espouses her belief that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression.\n\nJojo continues to interrogate Elsa. Elsa says she has a fianc\u00e9 called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Jojo forges a letter from Nathan, which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Hearing her crying, Jojo writes another letter retracting the first one. Jojo and Adolf argue, with Adolf insisting Elsa is a monster. Later, while on one of his metal collecting trips, Jojo spots his mother leaving a \"free Germany\" message in town.\n\nJojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz, visit his house. Klenzendorf rushes to Jojo's house while it is being searched. Since Nazi regulations require that all Nazi officers and members must have their daggers at all times, when the Gestapo notice that Jojo's Hitler Youth knife is missing, they are suspicious of Jojo's answer to how he lost it. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be Jojo's sister Inge. She tells the Gestapo she had taken the knife in order to protect herself against Jojo intruding into her room, and produces Inge's papers in answer to the Gestapo's challenges to her identity. She hands them to Klenzendorf and provides her own birthday to quell the Gestapo's suspicions. The Gestapo rely on Klenzendorf, who is holding the documents, to affirm her accuracy, and he does. Jojo is relieved, but Elsa later realizes she recited the wrong date and Klenzendorf had only pretended it was correct. Elsa is confident the Gestapo will eventually realize the deception. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square, recognizing her two-toned shoes. He breaks down, hugging her dead body. In his grief, he tries to tie her untied shoe lace, but can't get it right. Devastated, he returns home and stabs Elsa in the shoulder with his blunt Hitler Youth knife in vengeance, then breaks down again; Elsa comforts him.\n\nJojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler has committed suicide]] and that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] are closing in. When the village is attacked, Jojo and Yorki find cover, where they find Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm sending out children with grenades strapped to them to \"hug\" enemy soldiers before she charges into battle with a machine gun. Facing the [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, the city's garrison surrenders. The Soviets force several captured Germans into a backyard and line them up against a wall, including Jojo. A wounded Klenzendorf tells Jojo his mother was a good woman and to look after his \"sister\", then saves him by removing his Hitler Youth coat and calling him a Jew, causing the Soviet guards to drag him to safety. The soldiers expel Jojo, who runs away as gunshots are heard.\n\nJojo runs home and, to stop Elsa from leaving, tells her Germany won the war. Recognizing her despair, he recites a new letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of [[tuberculosis]] the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him like a \"younger brother\". A disheveled Adolf (now displaying a severe head wound) angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window, outgrowing him. Jojo takes Elsa outside and just before walking out the door, he bends down and ties Elsa's shoe: to this point, Jojo has never been able to fully tie shoe laces. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the Allies have won the war. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying before they dance in the street to a German rendition of \"[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roman Griffin Davis]] as Jojo, a young German boy who is a member of ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]''\n* [[Thomasin McKenzie]] as Elsa, a Jewish girl whom Rosie hides in her home\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as Adolf, Jojo's imaginary friend version of [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm, a brutish instructor in the Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Deertz, a [[Gestapo]] agent\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Captain Klenzendorf, an [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|army]] officer who runs a Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Rosie, Jojo's mother who is secretly [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi]]\n* [[Archie Yates]] as Yorki, Jojo's best friend and a member of ''Hitlerjugend''\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that [[Taika Waititi]] would direct, write, co-produce, and co-star in the film, as an imaginary [[Adolf Hitler]].

His absent father is supposedly serving on the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]] but has lost all contact, and his older sister Inge has recently died of [[influenza]]. The [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] Jojo often talks with his [[imaginary friend]], Adolf, a supportive and buffoonish version of [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nNow aged ten, it is time for Jojo to join the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]''. He attends his first [[Hitler Youth]] training camp with his best friend, Yorki, run by the one-eyed ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Captain Klenzendorf and assisted by Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm, where Jojo receives a knife. When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he tries to release it. The older boys snap its neck, and Jojo runs off crying after the other boys taunt him with the name \"Jojo Rabbit\". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns, stealing a ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'' and throwing it without permission in an effort to prove his bravery. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial and body scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, his mother coerces Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included, despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading [[propaganda]] leaflets throughout the town, and collecting [[scrap]] for the war effort.\n\nAlone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister's former classmate, hiding upstairs. Elsa reacts aggressively on their first encounter, pinning him against a wall and taking the knife issued to him as a member of Hitler Youth. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the [[Gestapo]], but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her, and threatens to kill him if he tells his mother. Intimidated, Jojo agrees to keep her safe, but soon afterwards returns and asks that she reveal her \"[[Antisemitic canard|Jew secrets]]\" so he can write a book about Jews for Klenzendorf, which amuses her. Elsa plays along by making up stories about Jewish powers, such as [[Telepathy|mind-reading]]. Angry with his mother for hiding a Jew but unable to reveal his knowledge of Elsa, Jojo accuses Rosie of being unpatriotic and laments that his father is away. Rosie dismisses his accusations and espouses her belief that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression.\n\nJojo continues to interrogate Elsa. Elsa says she has a fianc\u00e9 called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Jojo forges a letter from Nathan, which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Hearing her crying, Jojo writes another letter retracting the first one. Jojo and Adolf argue, with Adolf insisting Elsa is a monster. Later, while on one of his metal collecting trips, Jojo spots his mother leaving a \"free Germany\" message in town.\n\nJojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz, visit his house. Klenzendorf rushes to Jojo's house while it is being searched. Since Nazi regulations require that all Nazi officers and members must have their daggers at all times, when the Gestapo notice that Jojo's Hitler Youth knife is missing, they are suspicious of Jojo's answer to how he lost it. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be Jojo's sister Inge. She tells the Gestapo she had taken the knife in order to protect herself against Jojo intruding into her room, and produces Inge's papers in answer to the Gestapo's challenges to her identity. She hands them to Klenzendorf and provides her own birthday to quell the Gestapo's suspicions. The Gestapo rely on Klenzendorf, who is holding the documents, to affirm her accuracy, and he does. Jojo is relieved, but Elsa later realizes she recited the wrong date and Klenzendorf had only pretended it was correct. Elsa is confident the Gestapo will eventually realize the deception. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square, recognizing her two-toned shoes. He breaks down, hugging her dead body. In his grief, he tries to tie her untied shoe lace, but can't get it right. Devastated, he returns home and stabs Elsa in the shoulder with his blunt Hitler Youth knife in vengeance, then breaks down again; Elsa comforts him.\n\nJojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler has committed suicide]] and that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] are closing in. When the village is attacked, Jojo and Yorki find cover, where they find Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm sending out children with grenades strapped to them to \"hug\" enemy soldiers before she charges into battle with a machine gun. Facing the [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, the city's garrison surrenders. The Soviets force several captured Germans into a backyard and line them up against a wall, including Jojo. A wounded Klenzendorf tells Jojo his mother was a good woman and to look after his \"sister\", then saves him by removing his Hitler Youth coat and calling him a Jew, causing the Soviet guards to drag him to safety. The soldiers expel Jojo, who runs away as gunshots are heard.\n\nJojo runs home and, to stop Elsa from leaving, tells her Germany won the war. Recognizing her despair, he recites a new letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of [[tuberculosis]] the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him like a \"younger brother\". A disheveled Adolf (now displaying a severe head wound) angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window, outgrowing him. Jojo takes Elsa outside and just before walking out the door, he bends down and ties Elsa's shoe: to this point, Jojo has never been able to fully tie shoe laces. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the Allies have won the war. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying before they dance in the street to a German rendition of \"[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roman Griffin Davis]] as Jojo, a young German boy who is a member of ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]''\n* [[Thomasin McKenzie]] as Elsa, a Jewish girl whom Rosie hides in her home\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as Adolf, Jojo's imaginary friend version of [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Rahm, a brutish instructor in the Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Deertz, a [[Gestapo]] agent\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Captain Klenzendorf, an [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|army]] officer who runs a Hitler Youth camp\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Rosie, Jojo's mother who is secretly [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi]]\n* [[Archie Yates]] as Yorki, Jojo's best friend and a member of ''Hitlerjugend''\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that [[Taika Waititi]] would direct, write, co-produce, and co-star in the film, as an imaginary [[Adolf Hitler]].
