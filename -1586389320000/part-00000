First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Despite being fairly complete by the standards of its locale, many of the specimen's bones are flattened or fragmentary. UFSM 11471 was collected from the Bica S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 site, an outcrop of the [[Sanga do Cabral Formation]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil]]. Based on the presence of ''[[Procolophon]]'', the Sanga do Cabral Formation is likely [[Early Triassic]] ([[Induan]]-[[Olenekian]]) in age.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Genus|generic name]] of ''Elessaurus'' is derived from the word \"Elessar\". This word originated from the fictional language of [[Quenya]], which was invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] for [[Elf|elves]] in his [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]] series. It translated to \"elf-stone\", and is one of the many names of the character more well-known as [[Aragorn]]. Another name of Aragorn is \"long-shanks\", justifying its connection to ''Elessaurus'', which possessed characteristically elongated shin bones. The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] translates to \"Western [[Gondwana]]\", the region of the Early Triassic world which is now [[South America]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Elessaurus foot.png|thumb|213x213px|Pes (foot) of ''Elessaurus'']]\n[[File:Elessaurus vertebrae.png|left|thumb|Hip and tail vertebrae of ''Elessaurus'']]\nThe sacral rib of the second [[Sacrum|sacral (hip) vertebra]] bifurcates towards its contact with the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]]. Most of this sacral rib has a broad connection with the ilium, but at its rear it sends a pointed prong backwards. This trait is similar to ''[[Macrocnemus]]'' but unlike other tanystropheids, many of which do not have bifurcating sacral ribs. On the other hand, the caudal (tail) vertebrae resemble ''[[Tanytrachelos|Tanystrachelos]]'' and ''[[Jesairosaurus]]'' in possessing transverse processes which project backwards and upwards. The ilium has a straight and blade-like upper edge, a pronounced postacetabular process, and a short yet distinct preacetabular process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[femur]] is slender and [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]], similar to that of ''Macrocnemus'' and ''[[Augustaburiania]]''. The [[femoral head]] is not distinctly wider than the shaft and its ''[[caudofemoralis]]'' attachment ridge is in the form of an [[internal trochanter]] (like lizards and basal archosauromorphs) rather than a [[fourth trochanter]] (which is present in [[Archosauriformes|archosauriforms]]). The femur widens slightly near the knee, where it has a pair of distinct [[Condyle|condyles]]. The [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] are about 20% longer than the femur, a characteristic which is observed in ''Macrocnemus'' as well as [[Avemetatarsalia|avemetatarsalian]] [[Archosaur|archosaurs]] (like [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and early [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]]). The tibia may have a groove on its outer surface near the ankle like [[Proterochampsidae|proterochampsids]], but this may instead be an area of crushed bone. The [[fibula]] is thin and has a knob for the ''iliofibularis'' muscle near the knee.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe foot is asymmetrical, with the [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth metatarsal]] being the longest bone in the foot as with most non-archosauriform, non-tanystropheid archosauromorphs. Also like most early archosauromorphs, the [[Fifth metatarsal bone|fifth metatarsal]] is a short, hooked, L-shaped bone. The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] has six bones: an [[Talus bone|astragalus]], [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]], [[distal tarsals]] I, III, and IV, and a [[Centrale (bone)|centrale]]. This situation mirrors that of ''Macrocnemus bassannii'' and non-tanystropheid, non-archosauriform archosauromorphs. There is no foramen (hole) on the suture between the astragalus and calcaneum. The outer surface of calcaneum has an expansion known as a calcaneal tuber. A calcaneal tuber is known in archosauriforms and some [[Allokotosauria|allokotosaurs]], as well as at least one tanystropheid, ''Tanytrachelos''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Paleobiogeography and paleobiology ==\nAssuming ''Elessaurus'' is a relative of tanystropheids, it may illuminate the early origin of that unusual archosauromorph group. True tanystropheids first appeared in what is now Europe and China, though at the time these areas were northern regions of [[Pangaea]] along the margins of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]]. The oldest agreed-upon members of the group lived in [[Russia]] (''[[Augustaburiania]]'') and [[Germany]] (''[[Amotosaurus]]''). However, recently discovered Early Triassic [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical (neck) vertebrae]] from the [[Sanga do Cabral Formation|Sanga Do Cabral Formation]] suggest that tanystropheids were present in southern Pangaea around the same time that they started to become common in the north.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Tiane Macedo De Oliveira|first=|author2=Daniel Oliveira|author3=Cesar L.

It also suggests that tanystropheids may have originated in [[Gondwana]] (southern Pangaea) rather than [[Laurasia]] (northern Pangaea).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Elessaurus'' is construed to be a mostly terrestrial animal based on its hip and foot resembling ''Macrocnemus'' and other typical basal archosauromorphs. It does not possess any of the unusual characteristics of ''[[Tanystropheus]]'', a large and specialized tanystropheid which has been argued to be [[Semiaquatic|semi-aquatic]]. Nor does it resemble ''[[Dinocephalosaurus]]'', a possible tanystropheid which is even more adapted for aquatic life. If ''Elessaurus'' is considered an analogue for the origin of Tanystropheidae, the family was seemingly originally composed of terrestrial reptiles, with later semi-aquatic experimentation only evolving afterwards. ''Elessaurus'' is also notable among tanystropheids and their potential relatives due to hailing from a landlocked environment dominated by high-energy streams, rather than coastal swamps or beaches.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Classification ==\nDe-Oliveira ''et al''.

The [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] are about 20% longer than the femur, a characteristic which is observed in ''Macrocnemus'' as well as [[Avemetatarsalia|avemetatarsalian]] [[Archosaur|archosaurs]] (like [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and early [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]]). The tibia may have a groove on its outer surface near the ankle like [[Proterochampsidae|proterochampsids]], but this may instead be an area of crushed bone. The [[fibula]] is thin and has a knob for the ''iliofibularis'' muscle near the knee.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe foot is asymmetrical, with the [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth metatarsal]] being the longest bone in the foot as with most non-archosauriform, non-tanystropheid archosauromorphs. Also like most early archosauromorphs, the [[Fifth metatarsal bone|fifth metatarsal]] is a short, hooked, L-shaped bone. The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] has six bones: an [[Talus bone|astragalus]], [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]], [[distal tarsals]] I, III, and IV, and a [[Centrale (bone)|centrale]]. This situation mirrors that of ''Macrocnemus bassannii'' and non-tanystropheid, non-archosauriform archosauromorphs. There is no foramen (hole) on the suture between the astragalus and calcaneum. The outer surface of calcaneum has an expansion known as a calcaneal tuber. A calcaneal tuber is known in archosauriforms and some [[Allokotosauria|allokotosaurs]], as well as at least one tanystropheid, ''Tanytrachelos''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Paleobiogeography and paleobiology ==\nAssuming ''Elessaurus'' is a relative of tanystropheids, it may illuminate the early origin of that unusual archosauromorph group. True tanystropheids first appeared in what is now Europe and China, though at the time these areas were northern regions of [[Pangaea]] along the margins of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]]. The oldest agreed-upon members of the group lived in [[Russia]] (''[[Augustaburiania]]'') and [[Germany]] (''[[Amotosaurus]]''). However, recently discovered Early Triassic [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical (neck) vertebrae]] from the [[Sanga do Cabral Formation|Sanga Do Cabral Formation]] suggest that tanystropheids were present in southern Pangaea around the same time that they started to become common in the north.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Tiane Macedo De Oliveira|first=|author2=Daniel Oliveira|author3=Cesar L.

It also suggests that tanystropheids may have originated in [[Gondwana]] (southern Pangaea) rather than [[Laurasia]] (northern Pangaea).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Elessaurus'' is construed to be a mostly terrestrial animal based on its hip and foot resembling ''Macrocnemus'' and other typical basal archosauromorphs. It does not possess any of the unusual characteristics of ''[[Tanystropheus]]'', a large and specialized tanystropheid which has been argued to be [[Semiaquatic|semi-aquatic]]. Nor does it resemble ''[[Dinocephalosaurus]]'', a possible tanystropheid which is even more adapted for aquatic life. If ''Elessaurus'' is considered an analogue for the origin of Tanystropheidae, the family was seemingly originally composed of terrestrial reptiles, with later semi-aquatic experimentation only evolving afterwards. ''Elessaurus'' is also notable among tanystropheids and their potential relatives due to hailing from a landlocked environment dominated by high-energy streams, rather than coastal swamps or beaches.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Classification ==\nDe-Oliviera ''et al''. (2020) tested the affinities of ''Elessaurus'' by adding it to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]] previously created by Pritchard ''et al.''

Oilman [[Clint Murchison, Jr.|Clint Murchison Jr.]] had been trying to get an NFL expansion team in Dallas (as was [[Lamar Hunt]] \u2013 who ended up with an [[Kansas City Chiefs|AFL franchise]]), but [[George Preston Marshall]], owner of the [[Washington Redskins]], had a monopoly in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nMurchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins from Marshall in 1958. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. This infuriated Murchison and he called off the deal. Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\" and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959. Murchison purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.  Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he owned the song and Marshall could not play it during games. After a few Marshall expletives, Murchison gave the rights to \"Hail to the Redskins\" to Marshall for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a franchise at that time, and a [[Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry|rivalry]] was born.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 01 - Duane Thomas.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Cowboys playing against the Dolphins in [[Super Bowl VI]].]]\nFrom [[1970 NFL season|1970]] through [[1979 NFL season|1979]], the Cowboys won 105 regular season games, more than any other NFL franchise during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/fVEzy|title=Team Game Finder Query Results|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> In addition, they appeared in 5 and won two [[Super Bowl]]s, at the end of the [[1971 NFL season|1971]] and [[1977 NFL season|1977]] regular seasons.\n\n===1980s===\n[[Danny White]] became the Cowboys' starting quarterback in 1980 after quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] retired. Despite going 12\u20134 in [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|1980]], the Cowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs]] they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by defeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 30\u201327. For the NFC Championship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia, the team that won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their first conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20\u20137.\n\n[[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|1981]] brought another division championship for the Cowboys. They entered the [[1981-82 NFL playoffs]] as the number 2 seed. Their first game of the postseason saw them blow out Tampa Bay in a 38\u20130 shutout. For the Conference Title game they were pitted against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], the number 1 seed. Despite having a late 4th quarter 27\u201321 lead, they would lose to the 49ers 28\u201327. 49ers quarterback [[Joe Montana]] led his team on an 89-yard game-winning touchdown drive, connecting with [[Dwight Clark]] in a play known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]].\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 02 - Butch Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Cowboys playing against the Broncos in Super Bowl XII.]]\nThe [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|1982 season]] was shortened after a player strike. With a 6\u20133 record Dallas made it to the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs]] they eliminated the Buccaneers 30\u201317 in the Wild Card round and dispatched the Packers 37\u201326 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd consecutive Conference championship game. 3rd time was not the charm for the Cowboys as they fell 31\u201317 to their division rival and eventual [[Super Bowl XVII]] champions, the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFor the [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|1983 season]] the Cowboys went 12\u20134 and made it once again to the playoffs but were defeated at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24\u201317. Prior to the [[1984 Dallas Cowboys season|1984 season]], [[Bum Bright|H.R. \"Bum\" Bright]] purchased the Dallas Cowboys from [[Clint Murchison Jr.|Clint Murchison, Jr.]] Dallas posted a 9\u20137 record that season but missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons. After going 10\u20136 in [[1985 Dallas Cowboys season|1985]] and winning a division title, the Cowboys were shut out 20-0 by the Rams in the Divisional round at home.\n\nHard times came for the organization as they went 7\u20139 in [[1986 Dallas Cowboys season|1986]], 7\u20138 in [[1987 Dallas Cowboys season|1987]], and 3\u201313 in [[1988 Dallas Cowboys season|1988]]. During this time period Bright became disenchanted with the team. During the [[Savings and Loan crisis|savings and loan crisis]], the team and Mr. Bright's savings and loan were taken over by the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation|FSLIC]]. During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta in 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at coach [[Tom Landry]]'s play calling. The FSLIC forced Mr. Bright to sell the Cowboys to [[Jerry Jones]] on February 25, 1989.\n\nJones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history, replacing him with [[University of Miami]] head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was also Jerry Jones' teammate at the [[University of Arkansas]] as a fellow defensive lineman and Michael Irvin was under his tutelage in college. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected [[UCLA]] quarterback [[Troy Aikman]]. Later that same year, they would [[Herschel Walker trade|trade veteran running back]] [[Herschel Walker]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989 season]] with a 1\u201315 record, their worst in almost 30 years, \"The Trade\" later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.<ref>{{Citation|last=Law Nation|title=The Story of Dallas Cowboys 1992 3rd Super Bowl|date=January 7, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQcPRZLqeK8|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nJohnson quickly returned the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback [[Daryl Johnston]] and center [[Mark Stepnoski]] in 1989, running back [[Emmitt Smith]] in 1990, defensive tackle [[Russell Maryland]] and offensive tackle [[Erik Williams]] in 1991, and safety [[Darren Woodson]] in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]], guard [[Nate Newton]], linebacker [[Ken Norton Jr.]], and offensive lineman [[Mark Tuinei]], defensive lineman [[Jim Jeffcoat]], and veteran pickups such as tight end [[Jay Novacek]] and defensive end [[Charles Haley]].\n[[File:Texas Stadium - Dallas Cowboys World Champions Mural.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Five-time World Champions Mural]]\nThings started to look up for the franchise in [[1990 Dallas Cowboys season|1990]]. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the [[San Diego Chargers]] 17\u201314. They went 2\u20137 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish the season with a 4th place 7\u20139 record.\n\nComing into [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|1991]] the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator [[Dave Shula]] with [[Norv Turner]]; the Cowboys raced to a 6\u20135 start, then defeated the previously-unbeaten [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]] despite injury to [[Troy Aikman]].  Backup [[Steve Beuerlein]] took over and the Cowboys finished 11\u20135. In the Wild Card round they defeated the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] 17\u201313 for the Cowboys first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional round their season ended in a 38\u20136 playoff rout by the [[1991 Detroit Lions season|Lions]].\n\nIn [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|1992]] Dallas set a team record for regular season wins with a 13\u20133 mark. They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23\u201310. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys won that game 34\u201310 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first time in 10 years. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. On January 17, 1993 the Cowboys went to [[Candlestick Park]] and defeated the 49ers 30\u201320 to clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978. Dallas defeated the [[Buffalo Bills]] 52\u201317 in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], during which they forced a record nine turnovers. Johnson became the first coach to claim a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football.\n\nDespite starting the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]] season 0\u20132, they again defeated the Buffalo Bills in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]], 30\u201313 (becoming the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0\u20132). Dallas finished the regular season 12\u20134 as the number 1 seed of the NFC. They defeated the Green Bay Packers 27\u201317 in the divisional round. In the NFC Conference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38\u201321. Dallas sent a then-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety [[Thomas Everett]], Irvin, Johnston, Maryland, Newton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski, and Williams.\n\n[[File:Dallas Cowboys stadium championship banners 4.JPG|thumb|right|Dallas Cowboys championship banners inside AT&T Stadium]]\nOnly weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and Jones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his resignation. Jones then hired former [[University of Oklahoma]] head coach [[Barry Switzer]] to replace Johnson. The Cowboys finished 12\u20134 in [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|1994]]. They once again clinched a first round bye and defeated Green Bay 35\u20139 in the Divisional Round. They missed the Super Bowl, however, after losing to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38\u201328.\n\nPrior to the start of [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|1995 season]] Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] away from San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/1995/95nfl6.htm|title=Cowboys sign Sanders for Five Years, $30 Million|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 10, 1995|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> Dallas started the season 4\u20130 including shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35\u20130 at [[Giants Stadium]] to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12\u20134 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30\u201311 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38\u201327. In [[Super Bowl XXX]] the Cowboys defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 27\u201317 at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] for their fifth Super Bowl championship.

Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league for the first five games of [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|1996]] following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2\u20133. They finished the regular season with a 10\u20136 record, won the [[NFC East]] title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40\u201315 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26\u201317 by the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].\n\nThe Cowboys went 6\u201310 in [[1997 Dallas Cowboys season|1997]] (including losing their last 6 games of the season), with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/01/american-football-dallas-cowboys|title=Jeff Pearlman on the unbelievable story of the implosion of the Dallas Cowboys|work=the Guardian|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> As a result, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers offensive coordinator [[Chan Gailey]] was hired to take his place.\n\nGailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10\u20136 record in [[1998 Dallas Cowboys season|1998]] and an [[NFC East]] championship, but the Cowboys were defeated in the playoffs by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 20\u20137.\n\nIn [[1999 Dallas Cowboys season|1999]] Dallas went 8\u20138 (during which Irvin suffered a career-ending spinal injury in a loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]) ending in another playoff loss (this time to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 27\u201310). Gailey was fired and became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.\n\n===2000\u201309===\nDefensive coordinator [[Dave Campo]] was promoted to head coach for the [[2000 Dallas Cowboys season|2000 season]]. Prior to the season starting cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41\u201314 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB [[Randall Cunningham]] filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5\u201311 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.\n\n[[2001 Dallas Cowboys season|2001]] was another hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released from the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received. Jerry Jones signed [[Tony Banks (American football)|Tony Banks]] as a QB. Banks had been a starter for half of the season the previous year for the Super Bowl Champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] before being benched. Jones also drafted QB [[Quincy Carter]] in the second round of that year's draft, and Banks was released during the preseason. [[Ryan Leaf]], [[Anthony Wright (American football)|Anthony Wright]], and [[Clint Stoerner]] all competed for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at 5\u201311, last place in the NFC East, but they swept the Redskins for the 4th consecutive season.\n\nPrior to the [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|2002 season]] Dallas drafted safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]] with the 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Houston Texans]] 19\u201310 on Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by [[Walter Payton]]. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, that was their final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with another last place 5\u201311 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20\u201314 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as head coach at the conclusion of the season.\n\nJones then lured [[Bill Parcells]] out of retirement to coach the Cowboys. The Cowboys became the surprise team of the [[2003 Dallas Cowboys season|2003 season]] getting off to a hot 7\u20132 start, but went 3\u20134 for the rest of the season. They were able to grab the second NFC wild card spot with a 10\u20136 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29\u201310.\n\nIn [[2004 Dallas Cowboys season|2004]] Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success, and ended 6\u201310. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by [[Vinny Testaverde]].\n\nDallas got off to a hot 7\u20133 start for the [[2005 Dallas Cowboys season|2005 season]] but ended up in 3rd place with a 9\u20137 record. Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran [[Drew Bledsoe]] as starting quarterback.\n\n[[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|2006]] was an interesting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season they signed free agent wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] who was talented yet controversial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2374189|title=A star is born: Owens signs with the Cowboys|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2006|work=www.ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> The Cowboys started the season 3\u20132. During a week 7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup [[Tony Romo]]. Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 38\u201322. However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5\u20131 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9\u20137 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21\u201320. After the season Parcells retired and was replaced by [[Wade Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboysplus.com/classic/recordbook/coaches/123102campo.html |title=Dallas Cowboys Coaches |publisher=Cowboysplus.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDallas started the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|2007 season]] with a bang, winning their first five games. They won 12 of their first 13 games, with their only loss during that span being to [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England]], who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first round bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They lost in the divisional round 21\u201317 to the eventual [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]] champion [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].\n\nIn the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3\u20130 for the second straight year, en route to a 4\u20131 start. However, things soon went downhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in an overtime loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. With [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] and [[Brooks Bollinger]] playing as backups, Dallas went 1\u20132 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as Dallas went 3\u20130. However, injuries mounted during the season, with the team losing several starters for the year, such as [[Kyle Kosier]], [[Felix Jones]], safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]], punter [[Mat McBriar]], and several other starters playing with injuries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Josh|title=The Injury List Just Keeps On Growing|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=October 28, 2008|access-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031063704/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6|archive-date=October 31, 2008 }}</ref> Entering December, the 8\u20134 Cowboys underperformed, finishing 1\u20133. They failed to make the playoffs after losing at Philadelphia in the final regular season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs instead.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind storm. The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most serious injuries were special teams coach [[Joe DeCamillis]], who suffered fractured cervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his neck, and [[Rich Behm]], the team's 33-year-old scouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed.\n\nThe 2009 season started positively with a road win against Tampa Bay, but fortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2\u20132 start. In week five, with starting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver [[Miles Austin]] got his first start of the season and had a record setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns) to help lead Dallas to an overtime win over Kansas City. Following their [[bye week]], they went on a three-game winning streak including wins over Atlanta and NFC East division rival Philadelphia. Despite entering December with a record of 8\u20133, they lost their slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 24\u201317 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, they posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17\u20130) and Philadelphia (24\u20130) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. Dallas ended their playoff run after a hard divisional playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n===2010\u201313===\nAfter beginning the [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|2010 season]] at 1\u20137, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Jason Garrett]] as the interim head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/11/nfl-network-cowboys-fire-wade-phillips-as-head-coach-promote-jason-garrett/1|title=NFL Network: Cowboys fire Wade Phillips as head coach, promote Jason Garrett|accessdate=November 8, 2010 | work=USA Today|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The Cowboys finished the season 6\u201310.\n\nWith the 9th pick of the 1st round of the 2011 draft, the Cowboys selected [[University of Southern California|USC]] tackle [[Tyron Smith]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=6445535|title=Cowboys take OT Tyron Smith at No.9|last=Archer|first=Todd|date=April 28, 2011|publisher=ESPN|access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTo start the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|2011 season]] the Cowboys played the Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10\u20137, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by [[Jon Kitna]]. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17\u20137. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to [[Miles Austin]] as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On their opening possession after a 49ers punt, Romo found wide receiver [[Jesse Holley]] on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker [[Dan Bailey (American football)|Dan Bailey]].\n\nThe Cowboys ended the season 8\u20138. They were in a position to win the NFC East but lost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on [[NBC]] which allowed the Giants to win the division. The Giants would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]].\n\nThe Cowboys started off the [[2012 Dallas Cowboys season|2012 season]] on a high note by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 24\u201317 on the opening night of the season. They would hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a close Week 6 game to eventual [[Super Bowl XLVII]] champion Baltimore Ravens 31\u201329 at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore.\n\nGoing into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning the division. Standing in their way were the Washington Redskins, who had beaten them on Thanksgiving at [[AT&T Stadium]] and whom were one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by [[Robert Griffin III]] the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28-18. Dallas once again finished the season 8\u20138.\n\nIn the [[2013 Dallas Cowboys season|2013 season]] the Cowboys started off by defeating the New York Giants for the second straight year; this time 36\u201331. It was the first time since [[AT&T Stadium]] had opened back in 2009 that the Cowboys were able to defeat the Giants at home. The win was punctuated by [[Brandon Carr]] intercepting an [[Eli Manning]] pass for a touchdown late in the 4th quarter.\n\nFor the third straight year Dallas once again found themselves stuck in the .500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to the eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51\u201348. They battled it out with the Philadelphia Eagles for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back to back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division games having a 5\u20130 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24\u201323 on Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of [[Tony Romo]]. However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending interception to the Eagles which allowed the Eagles to win 24\u201322. Dallas ended the year at 8\u20138 for the third year in a row. The only difference of this 8\u20138 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes.\n\n===2014===\n{{very long section|date=October 2018}}\n{{Main|2014 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nTo start off the [[2014 Dallas Cowboys season|2014 season]] Dallas began by losing to San Francisco 28\u201317. After that they went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was defeating the Seahawks at [[CenturyLink Field]] 30\u201323. In Week 8, the Redskins won in overtime 20\u201317, and Romo injured his back again. He missed next week, a home loss to the Arizona Cardinals 28\u201317 with backup QB [[Brandon Weeden]]. Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31\u201317 victory over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], which was played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London, England]] as part of the [[NFL International Series]].\n\nDallas played their traditional Thanksgiving home game against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8\u20133 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33\u201310. They would rebound the next week when they defeated Chicago 41\u201328. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21\u20130. Then the Eagles put up 24 points but Dallas came back to win 38\u201327 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10\u20134. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts 42-7 and the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They became the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas ended the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and an 8\u20130 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44\u201317.\n\n====Wild Card Round====\nOn January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed [[Detroit Lions]] in the wild card round of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14\u20130 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. [[Matt Prater]] of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17\u20137. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback [[Matthew Stafford]] on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20\u20137. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20\u201314. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end [[Brandon Pettigrew]], but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker [[Anthony Hitchens]] in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24\u201320. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end [[DeMarcus Lawrence]], who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24\u201320. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game.\n\n====Divisional Round====\nThe following week, the Cowboys traveled to [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to play the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] in the divisional round. Despite having a 14\u20137 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26\u201321, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back [[DeMarco Murray]] to become a free agent. Murray signed with the [[Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry|division rival]] [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. On July 15 wide receiver [[Dez Bryant]] signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.\n\n===2015===\n{{Main|2015 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAt home against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas won 27\u201326. [[Dez Bryant]] left the game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], Romo suffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and [[Brandon Weeden]] replaced him. Dallas won 20\u201310 to begin the season 2\u20130, but then went on a seven-game losing streak. They finished the season 4\u201312 and last in their division.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main|2016 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAfter a preseason injury to [[Tony Romo]], rookie quarterback [[Dak Prescott]] was slated as the starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6\u20138 weeks. In game 1 against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas lost 20\u201319. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak. After much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo made an announcement that Prescott had earned the right to take over as the Cowboys starting quarterback.\n\nIn game 10, Romo suited up for the first time in the season and was the backup quarterback. Dallas defeated the [[Baltimore Ravens]] to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise record of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back [[Ezekiel Elliott]] breaking [[Tony Dorsett]]'s single season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Dan Marino]] by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13\u20133, tying their best 16-game regular season record. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at [[Lambeau Field]] in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the divisional round of the [[2016\u201317 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]] on a last-second field goal, ending the Cowboys\u2019 season.\n\nDak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4, 2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Both Prescott and Elliott made the [[2017 Pro Bowl]]. This is the first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys News: Dak Prescott And Ezekiel Elliott Headline Cowboys' Pro Bowl Selections - Blogging The Boys|url=https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2016/12/21/14029926/cowboys-news-notes-dak-and-zeke-headline-dallas-cowboys-pro-bowl-selections|website=Blogging the Boys (Dallas Cowboys blog)}}</ref>\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Dallas Cowboys season}}\n2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who retired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys. The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, [[Dez Bryant]] was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end [[Jason Witten]], who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] sports documentary series ''All or Nothing''. The series is produced by NFL Films.<ref>{{cite news|title='All or Nothing' series to showcase Cowboys' 2017 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000918226/article/all-or-nothing-series-to-showcase-cowboys-2017-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Thanksgiving Day games==\nIn 1966, six years after their founding, the Cowboys adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games. It is widely rumored that the Cowboys sought a guarantee that they would regularly host Thanksgiving games as a condition of their very first one (since games on days other than Sunday were uncommon at the time and thus high attendance was not a certainty).<ref>{{cite web|last=Scales|first=Kristi|title=Why Do the Cowboys Play on Thanksgiving Day?|url=http://www.5pointsblue.com/cowboys-play-thanksgiving-day/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=5PointsBlue.com|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> This is only partly true; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day. In 1975 and 1977, at the behest of then-Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], the then-[[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] replaced Dallas as a host team (Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976). Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys, who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era. This, combined with St. Louis's consistently weak attendance, a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three-game stretch, and opposition from the [[Kirkwood\u2013Webster Groves Turkey Day Game]] (a local [[high school football]] contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978; it was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever.<ref>{{cite news|last=McManaman|first=Bob|title=Cardinals, not Cowboys, could have been an NFL Thanksgiving Day staple|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2017/11/22/cardinals-nfl-thanksgiving-dallas-cowboys-host-team/883790001/|website=AZCentral.com|date=November 22, 2017|access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===Logo===\n[[File:Cowboys wordmark.svg|right|thumb|200px|The Cowboys' script logo.]]\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, which represents Texas as \"The Lone Star State,\" is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border was added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' [[Arena Football League|AFL]] team, the [[Dallas Desperados]] that have a similar logo based on that of the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that helps bring out the blue in the uniform.  The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe are on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms. The team uses a serifed font for the lettered player surnames on the jersey nameplates.<ref name=\"ScalesCowboys\">{{cite news|last=Scales|first=Kristi|title=BREAKING NEWS: Why the Cowboys Are Wearing a New Uniform Color-Combination on Sunday|url=http://www.5pointsblue.com/breaking-news-cowboys-wearing-new-uniform-color-combination-sunday/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=December 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210160453/http://www.5pointsblue.com/breaking-news-cowboys-wearing-new-uniform-color-combination-sunday/|archive-date=December 10, 2017|access-date=May 11, 2019|url-status=dead|quote=The Cowboys do not have an all-blue set of Color Rush.

The Cowboys also include a unique, if subtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of [[Dymo]] tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of the stripe at the back of the helmet.\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet Front.jpg|Front of Dallas Cowboys helmet\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet Back.jpg|Back of Dallas Cowboys helmet\n</gallery>\n\n====Uniform history====\nWhen the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included a white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe down the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a small blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for away games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1960.jpg|circa 1960\u20131963\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1960.jpg|Blue home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1960.jpg|White away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1964 the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silverblue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964 the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain \"throwback\" days.\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform has seen little change to the present day.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1964.jpg|circa 1964\u20131966\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1964.jpg|White home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1964.jpg|Blue away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nThe only notable changes in the last 40 years were:\n* from 1970\u20131973 when the \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes\n* from 1982\u20131988 the pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n* the removal of the indented [[serif]]s on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n* In 1980 the blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964\u201379 version; from 1981\u20131994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe. The stripes on the sleeves and socks also used the same gray with white border scheme (sans navy pinstripe).\n* Player names on jersey backs, which appeared in 1970, were originally in block-letter style; from 1982 onward the names were slightly smaller and in footed, \"serif\" style.\n* the 1996 addition of the word \"Cowboys\" in the center of the neckline which lasted until 1998 on the white jersey but currently remains on the blue jersey.\n\nDuring the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets were temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary.\n\n[[File:Cowboys 75anniv throwback.png|thumb|right|130px|The \"throwback\" NFL 75th Anniversary uniform was introduced in 1994.]]\n\nIn 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994\u20131995 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960\u201363 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's ''Classic Throwback Weekend'' on Thanksgiving Day 2001\u20132003.\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960\u20131963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960\u20131963 uniform may also be used on other special occasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players will no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving, which has since become an annual tradition.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\">{{cite web|last=Eatman|first=Nick|title=Cowboys To Wear Blue Jerseys At Home Thursday|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowboys-to-wear-blue-jerseys-at-home-thursday-344596|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=November 26, 2013|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\">{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Cowboys will wear navy jerseys at home more often|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000814752/article/cowboys-will-wear-navy-jerseys-at-home-more-often|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\">{{cite news|last=DaSilva|first=Cameron|title=Here's the real reason behind the Dallas Cowboys' mismatched uniform colors|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-nfl-uniforms-mismatched-gray-blue-home-away-throwback-thanksgiving-changes-061317|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks.

According to Mike McCord, the Cowboys' equipment director, one of the reasons why the Cowboys started wearing white at home was because of the intense heat during Cowboys' home games at [[Texas Stadium]].<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\" /><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\" />\n\n[[File:Staubach and Lilly HOF jerseys.jpg|thumb|Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly jerseys shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.]]\n\nThroughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"[[sports-related curses|jinxed]]\" because the team often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew attention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lukas|first=Paul|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/071025|title=ESPN Page 2 \u2013 Uni Watch: How 'bout them Cowboys?|publisher=ESPN|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> However, the roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional playoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in what turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Dallas's lone victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the 1978 NFC Championship game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSince the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super Bowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will wear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes), Miami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot climates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing teams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys going with retro look|first=Charean|last=Williams| work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=November 22, 2001}}</ref> such as when the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hosted the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=William N.|title=EAGLES DEVISE COLOR SCHEME FOR COWBOYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/sports/eagles-devise-color-scheme-for-cowboys.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1981|accessdate=December 10, 2016}}</ref> as well as their November 4, 2007 meeting.

With the implementation of the 2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear their regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, something they have not done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\"/>\n\n====Thanksgiving Day uniforms====\nWith the Cowboys traditionally hosting [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]], separate practice uniforms have been used for these games in recent years. Through the 2000 season, the Cowboys continued the usual practice of wearing white at home. In 2001, the Cowboys wore blue at home for the first time in years with was an older design of the blue jersey. Dallas would lose the game, but again wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and won. With the 2002 victory, it seems an exception to the theory of the blue jersey jinx is invoked on Thanksgiving.\n\nThus, the Cowboys continued wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving from 2003\u20132006, however it was always an older-styled alternate blue jersey. In 2007 and 2008, the Cowboys returned to wearing white at home for their Thanksgiving game. From 2009 to 2017, the Cowboys returned to wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving only. (From 2009\u20132012, the team again decided to go with an older-styled blue uniform as they had in previous years on Thanksgiving, and since 2013 have worn the newer-styled blue jersey.) The Cowboys wore white jerseys on Thanksgiving in 2018.\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Cowboys wore their [[Color Rush]] variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" jerseys for a Thanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Shannon|title=CowBuzz: Cowboys Unveil New ColorRush Uniform For Thanksgiving Day Game|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowbuzz-cowboys-unveil-new-colorrush-uniform-for-thanksgiving-day-game-393151|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=November 20, 2015|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Stadiums==\n\n===Cotton Bowl===\n{{Main|Cotton Bowl (stadium)}}\n[[File:CottonBowl.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance of the Cotton Bowl]]\nThe Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in [[Fair Park]], site of the [[State Fair of Texas]]. Concerts or other events using a stage allow the playing field to be used for additional spectators. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] college football bowl game, for which the stadium is named. (Beginning with the January 2010 game, the Cotton Bowl Classic has been played at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington.) The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to [[Texas Stadium]]. It is the only Cowboys stadium within the Dallas [[city limits]]. The Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|1966 NFL Championship]] at the Cotton Bowl.\n\n===Texas Stadium===\n{{Main|Texas Stadium}}\n[[File:Texas Stadium.jpeg|thumb|right|The outside of Texas Stadium]]\nFor the majority of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35&nbsp;million and with a [[seating capacity]] of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], 33\u201324, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving.\n\nIn [[2009 NFL season|2009]], it was replaced as home of the Cowboys by [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]], which officially opened on May 27, 2009 in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/cowboys/2009-09-17-cowboys-stadium-cover_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='This transcends football': 'Boys boast as new stadium shines | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | date=September 18, 2009 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> Texas Stadium was demolished by implosion on April 11, 2010.\n\n===AT&T Stadium===\n{{Main|AT&T Stadium}}\n[[File:Cowboys Stadium field.jpg|thumb|right|AT&T Stadium during a game]]\nAT&T Stadium, previously named Cowboys Stadium, is a [[domed stadium]] with a retractable roof in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].

The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach [[Jeff Fisher]] informed the officials that the punt struck the [[scoreboard]]. (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines \u2014 hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.\n\nThe first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants.

Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As such, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the sport.\n\n===Washington Redskins===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry}}\nThe Redskins and Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by ''Sports Illustrated'' the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in sports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed, due to a longstanding disagreement between Redskins owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Cowboys founder [[Clint Murchison Jr.|Clint Murchison, Jr.]] over the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Marshall's TV monopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26\u201314 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 116 regular season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 70\u201342\u20132, and the Redskins lead the all-time playoff series 2\u20130. The Cowboys currently have a 14\u20137 advantage over the Redskins at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over the Redskins for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, the Redskins have struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings.\n\n===Philadelphia Eagles===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 20\u20137. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach [[Buddy Ryan]]. Among these were the 1989 \"[[Bounty Bowl]]s\", in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker [[Luis Zendejas]] and [[Veterans Stadium]] fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game at Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and possibly paralyzed on the field. In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44\u20136. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78\u201330, including a 24\u20130 shutout in week 17. That three-game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992\u20131995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. During the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17\u20133 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in Philadelphia. They would meet again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback [[Tony Romo]] out with a season ending back injury which put backup [[Kyle Orton]] as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24\u201322 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road, with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33\u201310 win on [[National Football League on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38\u201327 in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 63\u201350.\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{main|Cowboys\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nThe first game ever played between the Giants and Cowboys was a 31\u201331 tie on December 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961 and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]] and winning the first regular season game played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in 2009. Dallas currently leads the all-time series 65\u201346\u20132.<ref name=\"footballdb1\"/>\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe two teams met in the first regular season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 35\u201328 loss to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]), the first-ever regular season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests.  The Steelers won [[Super Bowl X]] and [[Super Bowl XIII]]; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by [[Roger Staubach]], then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an [[onside kick]]. The Cowboys won [[Super Bowl XXX]] in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a \"flashy\" team with [[Roger Staubach]]'s aerial attack and the \"flex\" [[Doomsday Defense]]; while the Steelers were more of a [[blue-collar worker|\"blue-collar\"]] team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque [[Steel Curtain]] defense, a contrast that still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/articles/2008/12/06/sports/steelers/doc493b5cd78829a110461455.txt |title=Beaver County Times & Allegheny Times Online \u2013 Steelers |work=The Times |location=UK |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels.

San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers  are tied for third all-time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and New England Patriots, with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The Cowboys lead the all-time series with a record of 18-17-1.\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n{{main|Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry}}\n\nThe Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry is a rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the [[Green Bay Packers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/10/06/packers-cowboys-a-great-nfl-rivalry-is-renewed-sunday/106356050/|title=Packers vs Cowboys: Great NFL rivalry is renewed|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> It is one of the best known intra-conference [[National Football League rivalries|rivalries]] in the NFL.

Instead, the team has a [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|\"Ring of Honor\"]], which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president.\n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan.\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\nSome of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets\". The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.\n\nThe 5 most recent inductees are defensive end [[Charles Haley]], offensive lineman [[Larry Allen]], and wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], who were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] on November 6, 2011, safety [[Darren Woodson]], who was inducted on November 1, 2015, and executive [[Gil Brandt]], who was inducted on November 29, 2018.\n\n===Retired Numbers===\nThe Dallas Cowboys do not officially retire jersey numbers. However, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\". As of 2020, these following numbers have been kept out of circulation: [[Troy Aikman]]'s No. 8, [[Tony Romo]]'s No. 9, [[Roger Staubach]]'s No. 12, [[Bob Hayes]]' and [[Emmitt Smith]]'s No. 22, [[Bob Lilly]]'s No. 74, [[Jason Witten]]\u2019s No. 82, and No. 88, worn by [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], [[Michael Irvin]], and [[Dez Bryant]].\n\n===All-time first-round draft picks===\n{{Main|List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks}}\n\n==Head coaches and staff==\n\n===Head coaches===\n{{Main|List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches}}\n\n===Current staff===\n{{Dallas Cowboys staff}}\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{see also|Dallas Cowboys Radio Network}}\n{{as of|2010}}, the Cowboys' flagship radio station is [[KRLD-FM]]. [[Brad Sham]] is the team's longtime [[sports commentator|play-by-play voice]]. Working alongside him is former Cowboy quarterback [[Babe Laufenberg]], who returned in 2007 after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is [[KTVT]], the [[CBS]] owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included [[KVIL-FM]], [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], and [[KLUV-FM]]. Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show with late veteran sportscaster [[Frank Glieber]] and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for him and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\" at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with [[Bill Mercer]], famous for calling the ''Ice Bowl'' of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of [[World Class Championship Wrestling|WCCW]] in the 1980s. Upon Mercer's departure, [[Verne Lundquist]] joined the network, and became their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that capacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined the network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist.\n\nLongtime [[WFAA-TV]] sports anchor [[Dale Hansen]] was the Cowboys color analyst with Brad Sham as the play-by-play announcer from 1985\u20131996.\n\nDave Garrett served as the Cowboys' play-by-play announcer from 1995\u201397, when Brad Sham left the team and joined the Texas Rangers' radio network team as well as broadcast Sunday Night Football on Westwood One.\n\nSeeking to expand its radio broadcasting scope nationally, the Cowboys began a five-year partnership with [[Compass Media Networks]] on February 2, 2011. The result was the America's Team Radio Network, a supplement to the franchise's regional one.<ref>[http://www.rbr.com/radio/compass-signs-the-dallas-cowboys-for-new-network.html \"Compass signs the Dallas Cowboys for new network\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205233612/http://www.rbr.com/radio/compass-signs-the-dallas-cowboys-for-new-network.html |date=February 5, 2011 }}, ''Radio Business Report'', Wednesday, February 2, 2011</ref> Beginning with the 2011 season, [[Kevin Burkhardt]] and [[Danny White]] handled the broadcasts, with [[Jerry Recco]] as the studio host.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Broadcast Information|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/audio/radio-broadcast-information|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fight song==\nThe Dallas Cowboys fight song, \"Cowboys Stampede March\" by Tom Merriman Big Band was the official fight song of the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys used at [[Texas Stadium]] 1961 until about the early-mid '90s.\n\n\"This little platter came from the personal collection of Tex Schramm, and it seems to be from the dawn of the Dallas Cowboys when he was casting about for a song to associate with the team. Eventually, the song \"Cowboy Stampede March\" would become THE song associated with the team thru their broadcasts in the '60s thru the '80s.\" George Gimarc\n\nThe Cowboys now play [[We Dem Boyz]] by [[Wiz Khalifa]] for starting defensive line, because of the saying \"How Bout Dem Cowboys.\" For every touchdown scored by the Cowboys at a home game the song \"Cowboys and Cut Cigars\" by The

Oilman [[Clint Murchison, Jr.|Clint Murchison Jr.]] had been trying to get an NFL expansion team in Dallas (as was [[Lamar Hunt]] \u2013 who ended up with an [[Kansas City Chiefs|AFL franchise]]), but [[George Preston Marshall]], owner of the [[Washington Redskins]], had a monopoly in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nMurchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins from Marshall in 1958. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. This infuriated Murchison and he called off the deal. Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\" and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959. Murchison purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.  Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he owned the song and Marshall could not play it during games. After a few Marshall expletives, Murchison gave the rights to \"Hail to the Redskins\" to Marshall for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a franchise at that time, and a [[Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry|rivalry]] was born.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 01 - Duane Thomas.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Cowboys playing against the Dolphins in [[Super Bowl VI]].]]\nFrom [[1970 NFL season|1970]] through [[1979 NFL season|1979]], the Cowboys won 105 regular season games, more than any other NFL franchise during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/fVEzy|title=Team Game Finder Query Results|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> In addition, they appeared in 5 and won two [[Super Bowl]]s, at the end of the [[1971 NFL season|1971]] and [[1977 NFL season|1977]] regular seasons.\n\n===1980s===\n[[Danny White]] became the Cowboys' starting quarterback in 1980 after quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] retired. Despite going 12\u20134 in [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|1980]], the Cowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs]] they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by defeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 30\u201327. For the NFC Championship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia, the team that won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their first conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20\u20137.\n\n[[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|1981]] brought another division championship for the Cowboys. They entered the [[1981-82 NFL playoffs]] as the number 2 seed. Their first game of the postseason saw them blow out Tampa Bay in a 38\u20130 shutout. For the Conference Title game they were pitted against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], the number 1 seed. Despite having a late 4th quarter 27\u201321 lead, they would lose to the 49ers 28\u201327. 49ers quarterback [[Joe Montana]] led his team on an 89-yard game-winning touchdown drive, connecting with [[Dwight Clark]] in a play known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]].\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 02 - Butch Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Cowboys playing against the Broncos in Super Bowl XII.]]\nThe [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|1982 season]] was shortened after a player strike. With a 6\u20133 record Dallas made it to the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs]] they eliminated the Buccaneers 30\u201317 in the Wild Card round and dispatched the Packers 37\u201326 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd consecutive Conference championship game. 3rd time was not the charm for the Cowboys as they fell 31\u201317 to their division rival and eventual [[Super Bowl XVII]] champions, the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFor the [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|1983 season]] the Cowboys went 12\u20134 and made it once again to the playoffs but were defeated at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24\u201317. Prior to the [[1984 Dallas Cowboys season|1984 season]], [[Bum Bright|H.R. \"Bum\" Bright]] purchased the Dallas Cowboys from [[Clint Murchison Jr.|Clint Murchison, Jr.]] Dallas posted a 9\u20137 record that season but missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons. After going 10\u20136 in [[1985 Dallas Cowboys season|1985]] and winning a division title, the Cowboys were shut out 20-0 by the Rams in the Divisional round at home.\n\nHard times came for the organization as they went 7\u20139 in [[1986 Dallas Cowboys season|1986]], 7\u20138 in [[1987 Dallas Cowboys season|1987]], and 3\u201313 in [[1988 Dallas Cowboys season|1988]]. During this time period Bright became disenchanted with the team. During the [[Savings and Loan crisis|savings and loan crisis]], the team and Mr. Bright's savings and loan were taken over by the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation|FSLIC]]. During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta in 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at coach [[Tom Landry]]'s play calling. The FSLIC forced Mr. Bright to sell the Cowboys to [[Jerry Jones]] on February 25, 1989.\n\nJones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history, replacing him with [[University of Miami]] head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was also Jerry Jones' teammate at the [[University of Arkansas]] as a fellow defensive lineman and Michael Irvin was under his tutelage in college. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected [[UCLA]] quarterback [[Troy Aikman]]. Later that same year, they would [[Herschel Walker trade|trade veteran running back]] [[Herschel Walker]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989 season]] with a 1\u201315 record, their worst in almost 30 years, \"The Trade\" later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.<ref>{{Citation|last=Law Nation|title=The Story of Dallas Cowboys 1992 3rd Super Bowl|date=January 7, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQcPRZLqeK8|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nJohnson quickly returned the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback [[Daryl Johnston]] and center [[Mark Stepnoski]] in 1989, running back [[Emmitt Smith]] in 1990, defensive tackle [[Russell Maryland]] and offensive tackle [[Erik Williams]] in 1991, and safety [[Darren Woodson]] in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]], guard [[Nate Newton]], linebacker [[Ken Norton Jr.]], and offensive lineman [[Mark Tuinei]], defensive lineman [[Jim Jeffcoat]], and veteran pickups such as tight end [[Jay Novacek]] and defensive end [[Charles Haley]]. \n[[File:Texas Stadium - Dallas Cowboys World Champions Mural.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Five-time World Champions Mural]]\nThings started to look up for the franchise in [[1990 Dallas Cowboys season|1990]]. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the [[San Diego Chargers]] 17\u201314. They went 2\u20137 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish the season with a 4th place 7\u20139 record.\n\nComing into [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|1991]] the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator [[Dave Shula]] with [[Norv Turner]]; the Cowboys raced to a 6\u20135 start, then defeated the previously-unbeaten [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]] despite injury to [[Troy Aikman]].  Backup [[Steve Beuerlein]] took over and the Cowboys finished 11\u20135. In the Wild Card round they defeated the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] 17\u201313 for the Cowboys first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional round their season ended in a 38\u20136 playoff rout by the [[1991 Detroit Lions season|Lions]].\n\nIn [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|1992]] Dallas set a team record for regular season wins with a 13\u20133 mark. They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23\u201310. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys won that game 34\u201310 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first time in 10 years. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. On January 17, 1993 the Cowboys went to [[Candlestick Park]] and defeated the 49ers 30\u201320 to clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978. Dallas defeated the [[Buffalo Bills]] 52\u201317 in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], during which they forced a record nine turnovers. Johnson became the first coach to claim a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football.\n\nDespite starting the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]] season 0\u20132, they again defeated the Buffalo Bills in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]], 30\u201313 (becoming the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0\u20132). Dallas finished the regular season 12\u20134 as the number 1 seed of the NFC. They defeated the Green Bay Packers 27\u201317 in the divisional round. In the NFC Conference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38\u201321. Dallas sent a then-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety [[Thomas Everett]], Irvin, Johnston, Maryland, Newton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski, and Williams.\n\n[[File:Dallas Cowboys stadium championship banners 4.JPG|thumb|right|Dallas Cowboys championship banners inside AT&T Stadium]]\nOnly weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and Jones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his resignation. Jones then hired former [[University of Oklahoma]] head coach [[Barry Switzer]] to replace Johnson. The Cowboys finished 12\u20134 in [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|1994]]. They once again clinched a first round bye and defeated Green Bay 35\u20139 in the Divisional Round. They missed the Super Bowl, however, after losing to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38\u201328.\n\nPrior to the start of [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|1995 season]] Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] away from San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/1995/95nfl6.htm|title=Cowboys sign Sanders for Five Years, $30 Million|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 10, 1995|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> Dallas started the season 4\u20130 including shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35\u20130 at [[Giants Stadium]] to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12\u20134 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30\u201311 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38\u201327. In [[Super Bowl XXX]] the Cowboys defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 27\u201317 at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/1995.htm|title=Dallas Cowboys 1995 summary|publisher=Pro-Football Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league for the first five games of [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|1996]] following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2\u20133. They finished the regular season with a 10\u20136 record, won the [[NFC East]] title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40\u201315 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26\u201317 by the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].\n\nThe Cowboys went 6\u201310 in [[1997 Dallas Cowboys season|1997]] (including losing their last 6 games of the season), with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/01/american-football-dallas-cowboys|title=Jeff Pearlman on the unbelievable story of the implosion of the Dallas Cowboys|work=the Guardian|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> As a result, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers offensive coordinator [[Chan Gailey]] was hired to take his place.\n\nGailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10\u20136 record in [[1998 Dallas Cowboys season|1998]] and an [[NFC East]] championship, but the Cowboys were defeated in the playoffs by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 20\u20137.\n\nIn [[1999 Dallas Cowboys season|1999]] Dallas went 8\u20138 (during which Irvin suffered a career-ending spinal injury in a loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]) ending in another playoff loss (this time to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 27\u201310). Gailey was fired and became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.\n\n===2000\u201309===\nDefensive coordinator [[Dave Campo]] was promoted to head coach for the [[2000 Dallas Cowboys season|2000 season]]. Prior to the season starting cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41\u201314 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB [[Randall Cunningham]] filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5\u201311 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.\n\n[[2001 Dallas Cowboys season|2001]] was another hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released from the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received. Jerry Jones signed [[Tony Banks (American football)|Tony Banks]] as a QB. Banks had been a starter for half of the season the previous year for the Super Bowl Champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] before being benched. Jones also drafted QB [[Quincy Carter]] in the second round of that year's draft, and Banks was released during the preseason. [[Ryan Leaf]], [[Anthony Wright (American football)|Anthony Wright]], and [[Clint Stoerner]] all competed for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at 5\u201311, last place in the NFC East, but they swept the Redskins for the 4th consecutive season.\n\nPrior to the [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|2002 season]] Dallas drafted safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]] with the 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Houston Texans]] 19\u201310 on Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by [[Walter Payton]]. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, that was their final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with another last place 5\u201311 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20\u201314 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as head coach at the conclusion of the season.\n\nJones then lured [[Bill Parcells]] out of retirement to coach the Cowboys. The Cowboys became the surprise team of the [[2003 Dallas Cowboys season|2003 season]] getting off to a hot 7\u20132 start, but went 3\u20134 for the rest of the season. They were able to grab the second NFC wild card spot with a 10\u20136 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29\u201310.\n\nIn [[2004 Dallas Cowboys season|2004]] Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success, and ended 6\u201310. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by [[Vinny Testaverde]].\n\nDallas got off to a hot 7\u20133 start for the [[2005 Dallas Cowboys season|2005 season]] but ended up in 3rd place with a 9\u20137 record. Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran [[Drew Bledsoe]] as starting quarterback.\n\n[[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|2006]] was an interesting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season they signed free agent wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] who was talented yet controversial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2374189|title=A star is born: Owens signs with the Cowboys|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2006|work=www.ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref> The Cowboys started the season 3\u20132. During a week 7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup [[Tony Romo]]. Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 38\u201322. However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5\u20131 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9\u20137 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21\u201320.

They won 12 of their first 13 games, with their only loss during that span being to [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England]], who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first round bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They lost in the divisional round 21\u201317 to the eventual [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]] champion [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].\n\nIn the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3\u20130 for the second straight year, en route to a 4\u20131 start. However, things soon went downhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in an overtime loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. With [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] and [[Brooks Bollinger]] playing as backups, Dallas went 1\u20132 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as Dallas went 3\u20130. However, injuries mounted during the season, with the team losing several starters for the year, such as [[Kyle Kosier]], [[Felix Jones]], safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]], punter [[Mat McBriar]], and several other starters playing with injuries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Josh|title=The Injury List Just Keeps On Growing|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=October 28, 2008|access-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031063704/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6|archive-date=October 31, 2008 }}</ref> Entering December, the 8\u20134 Cowboys underperformed, finishing 1\u20133. They failed to make the playoffs after losing at Philadelphia in the final regular season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs instead.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind storm. The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most serious injuries were special teams coach [[Joe DeCamillis]], who suffered fractured cervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his neck, and [[Rich Behm]], the team's 33-year-old scouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed.\n\nThe 2009 season started positively with a road win against Tampa Bay, but fortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2\u20132 start. In week five, with starting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver [[Miles Austin]] got his first start of the season and had a record setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns) to help lead Dallas to an overtime win over Kansas City. Following their [[bye week]], they went on a three-game winning streak including wins over Atlanta and NFC East division rival Philadelphia. Despite entering December with a record of 8\u20133, they lost their slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 24\u201317 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, they posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17\u20130) and Philadelphia (24\u20130) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. Dallas ended their playoff run after a hard divisional playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n===2010\u201313===\nAfter beginning the [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|2010 season]] at 1\u20137, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Jason Garrett]] as the interim head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/11/nfl-network-cowboys-fire-wade-phillips-as-head-coach-promote-jason-garrett/1|title=NFL Network: Cowboys fire Wade Phillips as head coach, promote Jason Garrett|accessdate=November 8, 2010 | work=USA Today|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The Cowboys finished the season 6\u201310.\n\nWith the 9th pick of the 1st round of the 2011 draft, the Cowboys selected [[University of Southern California|USC]] tackle [[Tyron Smith]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/news/story?id=6445535|title=Cowboys take OT Tyron Smith at No.9|last=Archer|first=Todd|date=April 28, 2011|publisher=ESPN|access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref> \n\nTo start the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|2011 season]] the Cowboys played the Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10\u20137, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by [[Jon Kitna]]. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17\u20137. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to [[Miles Austin]] as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On their opening possession after a 49ers punt, Romo found wide receiver [[Jesse Holley]] on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker [[Dan Bailey (American football)|Dan Bailey]].\n\nThe Cowboys ended the season 8\u20138. They were in a position to win the NFC East but lost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on [[NBC]] which allowed the Giants to win the division. The Giants would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]].\n\nThe Cowboys started off the [[2012 Dallas Cowboys season|2012 season]] on a high note by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 24\u201317 on the opening night of the season. They would hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a close Week 6 game to eventual [[Super Bowl XLVII]] champion Baltimore Ravens 31\u201329 at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore.\n\nGoing into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning the division. Standing in their way were the Washington Redskins, who had beaten them on Thanksgiving at [[AT&T Stadium]] and whom were one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by [[Robert Griffin III]] the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28-18. Dallas once again finished the season 8\u20138.\n\nIn the [[2013 Dallas Cowboys season|2013 season]] the Cowboys started off by defeating the New York Giants for the second straight year; this time 36\u201331. It was the first time since [[AT&T Stadium]] had opened back in 2009 that the Cowboys were able to defeat the Giants at home. The win was punctuated by [[Brandon Carr]] intercepting an [[Eli Manning]] pass for a touchdown late in the 4th quarter.\n\nFor the third straight year Dallas once again found themselves stuck in the .500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to the eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51\u201348. They battled it out with the Philadelphia Eagles for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back to back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division games having a 5\u20130 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24\u201323 on Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of [[Tony Romo]]. However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending interception to the Eagles which allowed the Eagles to win 24\u201322. Dallas ended the year at 8\u20138 for the third year in a row. The only difference of this 8\u20138 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes.\n\n===2014===\n{{very long section|date=October 2018}}\n{{Main|2014 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nTo start off the [[2014 Dallas Cowboys season|2014 season]] Dallas began by losing to San Francisco 28\u201317. After that they went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was defeating the Seahawks at [[CenturyLink Field]] 30\u201323. In Week 8, the Redskins won in overtime 20\u201317, and Romo injured his back again. He missed next week, a home loss to the Arizona Cardinals 28\u201317 with backup QB [[Brandon Weeden]]. Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31\u201317 victory over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], which was played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London, England]] as part of the [[NFL International Series]].\n\nDallas played their traditional Thanksgiving home game against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8\u20133 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33\u201310. They would rebound the next week when they defeated Chicago 41\u201328. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21\u20130. Then the Eagles put up 24 points but Dallas came back to win 38\u201327 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10\u20134. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts 42-7 and the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They became the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas ended the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and an 8\u20130 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44\u201317.\n\n====Wild Card Round====\nOn January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed [[Detroit Lions]] in the wild card round of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14\u20130 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. [[Matt Prater]] of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17\u20137. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback [[Matthew Stafford]] on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20\u20137. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20\u201314. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end [[Brandon Pettigrew]], but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker [[Anthony Hitchens]] in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24\u201320. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end [[DeMarcus Lawrence]], who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24\u201320. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game.\n\n====Divisional Round====\nThe following week, the Cowboys traveled to [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to play the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] in the divisional round. Despite having a 14\u20137 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26\u201321, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back [[DeMarco Murray]] to become a free agent. Murray signed with the [[Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry|division rival]] [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. On July 15 wide receiver [[Dez Bryant]] signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.\n\n===2015===\n{{Main|2015 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAt home against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas won 27\u201326. [[Dez Bryant]] left the game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], Romo suffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and [[Brandon Weeden]] replaced him. Dallas won 20\u201310 to begin the season 2\u20130, but then went on a seven-game losing streak. They finished the season 4\u201312 and last in their division.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main|2016 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAfter a preseason injury to [[Tony Romo]], rookie quarterback [[Dak Prescott]] was slated as the starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6\u20138 weeks. In game 1 against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas lost 20\u201319. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak. After much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo made an announcement that Prescott had earned the right to take over as the Cowboys starting quarterback.\n\nIn game 10, Romo suited up for the first time in the season and was the backup quarterback. Dallas defeated the [[Baltimore Ravens]] to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise record of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back [[Ezekiel Elliott]] breaking [[Tony Dorsett]]'s single season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Dan Marino]] by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13\u20133, tying their best 16-game regular season record. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at [[Lambeau Field]] in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the divisional round of the [[2016\u201317 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]] on a last-second field goal, ending the Cowboys\u2019 season.\n\nDak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4, 2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Both Prescott and Elliott made the [[2017 Pro Bowl]]. This is the first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys News: Dak Prescott And Ezekiel Elliott Headline Cowboys' Pro Bowl Selections - Blogging The Boys|url=https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2016/12/21/14029926/cowboys-news-notes-dak-and-zeke-headline-dallas-cowboys-pro-bowl-selections|website=Blogging the Boys (Dallas Cowboys blog)}}</ref>\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 Dallas Cowboys season}}\n2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who retired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys. The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, [[Dez Bryant]] was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end [[Jason Witten]], who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] sports documentary series ''All or Nothing''. The series is produced by NFL Films.<ref>{{cite news|title='All or Nothing' series to showcase Cowboys' 2017 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000918226/article/all-or-nothing-series-to-showcase-cowboys-2017-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Thanksgiving Day games==\nIn 1966, six years after their founding, the Cowboys adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games. It is widely rumored that the Cowboys sought a guarantee that they would regularly host Thanksgiving games as a condition of their very first one (since games on days other than Sunday were uncommon at the time and thus high attendance was not a certainty).<ref>{{cite web|last=Scales|first=Kristi|title=Why Do the Cowboys Play on Thanksgiving Day?|url=http://www.5pointsblue.com/cowboys-play-thanksgiving-day/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=5PointsBlue.com|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> This is only partly true; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day. In 1975 and 1977, at the behest of then-Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], the then-[[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] replaced Dallas as a host team (Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976). Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys, who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era. This, combined with St. Louis's consistently weak attendance, a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three-game stretch, and opposition from the [[Kirkwood\u2013Webster Groves Turkey Day Game]] (a local [[high school football]] contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978; it was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever.<ref>{{cite news|last=McManaman|first=Bob|title=Cardinals, not Cowboys, could have been an NFL Thanksgiving Day staple|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2017/11/22/cardinals-nfl-thanksgiving-dallas-cowboys-host-team/883790001/|website=AZCentral.com|date=November 22, 2017|access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===Logo===\n[[File:Cowboys wordmark.svg|right|thumb|200px|The Cowboys' script logo.]]\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, which represents Texas as \"The Lone Star State,\" is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border was added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' [[Arena Football League|AFL]] team, the [[Dallas Desperados]] that have a similar logo based on that of the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that helps bring out the blue in the uniform.  The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe are on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms.

Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1960.jpg|circa 1960\u20131963\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1960.jpg|Blue home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1960.jpg|White away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1964 the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silverblue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964 the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain \"throwback\" days.\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform has seen little change to the present day.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1964.jpg|circa 1964\u20131966\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1964.jpg|White home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1964.jpg|Blue away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nThe only notable changes in the last 40 years were:\n* from 1970\u20131973 when the \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes\n* from 1982\u20131988 the pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n* the removal of the indented [[serif]]s on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n* In 1980 the blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964\u201379 version; from 1981\u20131994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe. The stripes on the sleeves and socks also used the same gray with white border scheme (sans navy pinstripe).\n* Player names on jersey backs, which appeared in 1970, were originally in block-letter style; from 1982 onward the names were slightly smaller and in footed, \"serif\" style.\n* the 1996 addition of the word \"Cowboys\" in the center of the neckline which lasted until 1998 on the white jersey but currently remains on the blue jersey.\n\nDuring the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets were temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary.\n\n[[File:Cowboys 75anniv throwback.png|thumb|right|130px|The \"throwback\" NFL 75th Anniversary uniform was introduced in 1994.]]\n\nIn 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994\u20131995 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960\u201363 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's ''Classic Throwback Weekend'' on Thanksgiving Day 2001\u20132003.\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960\u20131963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960\u20131963 uniform may also be used on other special occasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players will no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving, which has since become an annual tradition.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\">{{cite web|last=Eatman|first=Nick|title=Cowboys To Wear Blue Jerseys At Home Thursday|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowboys-to-wear-blue-jerseys-at-home-thursday-344596|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=November 26, 2013|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\">{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Cowboys will wear navy jerseys at home more often|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000814752/article/cowboys-will-wear-navy-jerseys-at-home-more-often|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\">{{cite news|last=DaSilva|first=Cameron|title=Here's the real reason behind the Dallas Cowboys' mismatched uniform colors|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-nfl-uniforms-mismatched-gray-blue-home-away-throwback-thanksgiving-changes-061317|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks.

According to Mike McCord, the Cowboys' equipment director, one of the reasons why the Cowboys started wearing white at home was because of the intense heat during Cowboys' home games at [[Texas Stadium]].<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\" /><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\" />\n\n[[File:Staubach and Lilly HOF jerseys.jpg|thumb|Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly jerseys shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.]]\n\nThroughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"[[sports-related curses|jinxed]]\" because the team often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew attention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lukas|first=Paul|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/071025|title=ESPN Page 2 \u2013 Uni Watch: How 'bout them Cowboys?|publisher=ESPN|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> However, the roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional playoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in what turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Dallas's lone victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the 1978 NFC Championship game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSince the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super Bowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will wear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes), Miami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot climates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing teams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys going with retro look|first=Charean|last=Williams| work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=November 22, 2001}}</ref> such as when the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hosted the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=William N.|title=EAGLES DEVISE COLOR SCHEME FOR COWBOYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/sports/eagles-devise-color-scheme-for-cowboys.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1981|accessdate=December 10, 2016}}</ref> as well as their November 4, 2007 meeting.

With the implementation of the 2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear their regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, something they have not done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\"/>\n\n====Thanksgiving Day uniforms====\nWith the Cowboys traditionally hosting [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]], separate practice uniforms have been used for these games in recent years. Through the 2000 season, the Cowboys continued the usual practice of wearing white at home. In 2001, the Cowboys wore blue at home for the first time in years with was an older design of the blue jersey. Dallas would lose the game, but again wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and won. With the 2002 victory, it seems an exception to the theory of the blue jersey jinx is invoked on Thanksgiving.\n\nThus, the Cowboys continued wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving from 2003\u20132006, however it was always an older-styled alternate blue jersey. In 2007 and 2008, the Cowboys returned to wearing white at home for their Thanksgiving game. From 2009 to 2017, the Cowboys returned to wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving only. (From 2009\u20132012, the team again decided to go with an older-styled blue uniform as they had in previous years on Thanksgiving, and since 2013 have worn the newer-styled blue jersey.) The Cowboys wore white jerseys on Thanksgiving in 2018.\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Cowboys wore their [[Color Rush]] variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" jerseys for a Thanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Shannon|title=CowBuzz: Cowboys Unveil New ColorRush Uniform For Thanksgiving Day Game|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowbuzz-cowboys-unveil-new-colorrush-uniform-for-thanksgiving-day-game-393151|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=November 20, 2015|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Stadiums==\n\n===Cotton Bowl===\n{{Main|Cotton Bowl (stadium)}}\n[[File:CottonBowl.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance of the Cotton Bowl]]\nThe Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in [[Fair Park]], site of the [[State Fair of Texas]]. Concerts or other events using a stage allow the playing field to be used for additional spectators. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] college football bowl game, for which the stadium is named. (Beginning with the January 2010 game, the Cotton Bowl Classic has been played at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington.) The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to [[Texas Stadium]]. It is the only Cowboys stadium within the Dallas [[city limits]]. The Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|1966 NFL Championship]] at the Cotton Bowl.\n\n===Texas Stadium===\n{{Main|Texas Stadium}}\n[[File:Texas Stadium.jpeg|thumb|right|The outside of Texas Stadium]]\nFor the majority of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35&nbsp;million and with a [[seating capacity]] of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], 33\u201324, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving.\n\nIn [[2009 NFL season|2009]], it was replaced as home of the Cowboys by [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]], which officially opened on May 27, 2009 in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/cowboys/2009-09-17-cowboys-stadium-cover_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='This transcends football': 'Boys boast as new stadium shines | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | date=September 18, 2009 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> Texas Stadium was demolished by implosion on April 11, 2010.\n\n===AT&T Stadium===\n{{Main|AT&T Stadium}}\n[[File:Cowboys Stadium field.jpg|thumb|right|AT&T Stadium during a game]]\nAT&T Stadium, previously named Cowboys Stadium, is a [[domed stadium]] with a retractable roof in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].

The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach [[Jeff Fisher]] informed the officials that the punt struck the [[scoreboard]]. (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines \u2014 hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.\n\nThe first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants. A league record-setting 105,121 fans showed up to fill Cowboys Stadium for the game before which the traditional \"blue star\" at the 50-yard line was unveiled for the first time; however, the Cowboys lost in the final seconds, 33\u201331.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Rob|title=Open & Shut|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=DBA2D9CD-CCD8-CBA6-3963CB2ABC03AEDF|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=September 21, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924233939/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=DBA2D9CD-CCD8-CBA6-3963CB2ABC03AEDF|archivedate=September 24, 2009|accessdate=August 29, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboys got their first regular season home win on September 28, 2009.

Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As such, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the sport.\n\n===Washington Redskins===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry}}\nThe Redskins and Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by ''Sports Illustrated'' the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in sports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed, due to a longstanding disagreement between Redskins owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Cowboys founder [[Clint Murchison Jr.|Clint Murchison, Jr.]] over the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Marshall's TV monopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26\u201314 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 116 regular season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 70\u201342\u20132, and the Redskins lead the all-time playoff series 2\u20130. The Cowboys currently have a 14\u20137 advantage over the Redskins at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over the Redskins for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, the Redskins have struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings.\n\n===Philadelphia Eagles===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 20\u20137. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach [[Buddy Ryan]]. Among these were the 1989 \"[[Bounty Bowl]]s\", in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker [[Luis Zendejas]] and [[Veterans Stadium]] fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game at Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and possibly paralyzed on the field. In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44\u20136. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78\u201330, including a 24\u20130 shutout in week 17. That three-game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992\u20131995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. During the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17\u20133 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in Philadelphia. They would meet again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback [[Tony Romo]] out with a season ending back injury which put backup [[Kyle Orton]] as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24\u201322 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road, with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33\u201310 win on [[National Football League on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38\u201327 in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 63\u201350.\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{main|Cowboys\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nThe first game ever played between the Giants and Cowboys was a 31\u201331 tie on December 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961 and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]] and winning the first regular season game played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in 2009. Dallas currently leads the all-time series 65\u201346\u20132.<ref name=\"footballdb1\"/>\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry}} \nThe two teams met in the first regular season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 35\u201328 loss to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]), the first-ever regular season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests.  The Steelers won [[Super Bowl X]] and [[Super Bowl XIII]]; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by [[Roger Staubach]], then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an [[onside kick]]. The Cowboys won [[Super Bowl XXX]] in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a \"flashy\" team with [[Roger Staubach]]'s aerial attack and the \"flex\" [[Doomsday Defense]]; while the Steelers were more of a [[blue-collar worker|\"blue-collar\"]] team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque [[Steel Curtain]] defense, a contrast that still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/articles/2008/12/06/sports/steelers/doc493b5cd78829a110461455.txt |title=Beaver County Times & Allegheny Times Online \u2013 Steelers |work=The Times |location=UK |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels.

San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers  are tied for third all-time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and New England Patriots, with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The Cowboys lead the all-time series with a record of 18-17-1.\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n{{main|Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry}}\n\nThe Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry is a rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the [[Green Bay Packers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/10/06/packers-cowboys-a-great-nfl-rivalry-is-renewed-sunday/106356050/|title=Packers vs Cowboys: Great NFL rivalry is renewed|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> It is one of the best known intra-conference [[National Football League rivalries|rivalries]] in the NFL. The two teams do not play every year; instead, they play once every three years due to the NFL's rotating division schedules, or if the two teams finish in the same place in their respective divisions, they would play the ensuing post-season.

Instead, the team has a [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|\"Ring of Honor\"]], which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president. \n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan.\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\nSome of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets\". The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.\n\nThe 5 most recent inductees are defensive end [[Charles Haley]], offensive lineman [[Larry Allen]], and wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], who were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] on November 6, 2011, safety [[Darren Woodson]], who was inducted on November 1, 2015, and executive [[Gil Brandt]], who was inducted on November 29, 2018.\n\n===Retired Numbers===\nThe Dallas Cowboys do not officially retire jersey numbers. However, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\". As of 2020, these following numbers have been kept out of circulation: [[Troy Aikman]]'s No. 8, [[Tony Romo]]'s No. 9, [[Roger Staubach]]'s No. 12, [[Bob Hayes]]' and [[Emmitt Smith]]'s No. 22, [[Bob Lilly]]'s No. 74, [[Jason Witten]]\u2019s No. 82, and No. 88, worn by [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], [[Michael Irvin]], and [[Dez Bryant]].\n\n===All-time first-round draft picks===\n{{Main|List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks}}\n\n==Head coaches and staff==\n\n===Head coaches===\n{{Main|List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches}}\n\n===Current staff===\n{{Dallas Cowboys staff}}\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{see also|Dallas Cowboys Radio Network}}\n{{as of|2010}}, the Cowboys' flagship radio station is [[KRLD-FM]]. [[Brad Sham]] is the team's longtime [[sports commentator|play-by-play voice]]. Working alongside him is former Cowboy quarterback [[Babe Laufenberg]], who returned in 2007 after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is [[KTVT]], the [[CBS]] owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included [[KVIL-FM]], [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], and [[KLUV-FM]]. Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show with late veteran sportscaster [[Frank Glieber]] and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for him and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\" at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with [[Bill Mercer]], famous for calling the ''Ice Bowl'' of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of [[World Class Championship Wrestling|WCCW]] in the 1980s. Upon Mercer's departure, [[Verne Lundquist]] joined the network, and became their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that capacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined the network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist.\n\nLongtime [[WFAA-TV]] sports anchor [[Dale Hansen]] was the Cowboys color analyst with Brad Sham as the play-by-play announcer from 1985\u20131996.\n\nDave Garrett served as the Cowboys' play-by-play announcer from 1995\u201397, when Brad Sham left the team and joined the Texas Rangers' radio network team as well as broadcast Sunday Night Football on Westwood One.\n\nSeeking to expand its radio broadcasting scope nationally, the Cowboys began a five-year partnership with [[Compass Media Networks]] on February 2, 2011. The result was the America's Team Radio Network, a supplement to the franchise's regional one.<ref>[http://www.rbr.com/radio/compass-signs-the-dallas-cowboys-for-new-network.html \"Compass signs the Dallas Cowboys for new network\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205233612/http://www.rbr.com/radio/compass-signs-the-dallas-cowboys-for-new-network.html |date=February 5, 2011 }}, ''Radio Business Report'', Wednesday, February 2, 2011</ref> Beginning with the 2011 season, [[Kevin Burkhardt]] and [[Danny White]] handled the broadcasts, with [[Jerry Recco]] as the studio host.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Broadcast Information|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/audio/radio-broadcast-information|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fight song==\nThe Dallas Cowboys fight song, \"Cowboys Stampede March\" by Tom Merriman Big Band was the official fight song of the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys used at [[Texas Stadium]] 1961 until about the early-mid '90s.\n\n\"This little platter came from the personal collection of Tex Schramm, and it seems to be from the dawn of the Dallas Cowboys when he was casting about for a song to associate with the team. Eventually, the song \"Cowboy Stampede March\" would become THE song associated with the team thru their broadcasts in the '60s thru the '80s.\" George Gimarc\n\nThe Cowboys now play [[We Dem Boyz]] by [[Wiz Khalifa]] for starting defensive line, because of the saying \"How Bout Dem Cowboys.\" For every touchdown scored by the Cowboys at a home game the song \"Cowboys and Cut Cigars\" by The Burning of Rome is played after a train horn.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]]\n* [[List of Dallas Cowboys seasons]]\n* [[List of Dallas Cowboys players]]\n* [[America's Team]]\n* [[Doomsday Defense]]\n\n==References==\n* NFL 2002 Record & Fact Book {{ISBN|0-7611-2643-0}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Aron |first= Jaime |title= Dallas Cowboys: The Complete Illustrated History |year= 2010 |publisher=MVP Books |ISBN=978-0-7603-3520-8}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hitzges |first=Norm |author2=St. Angelo, Ron |title=Greatest Team Ever: The Dallas Cowboys Dynasty of the 1990s |year=2007 |publisher=Rutledge Hill Press |ISBN=1-4016-0340-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatestteamever00stan }}\n* {{Cite book |last= Myers |first= Gary |title= The Catch: One Play, Two Dynasties, and the Game That Changed the NFL |year= 2009 |publisher= Crown Archetype |ISBN= 978-0-307-40908-9 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/catchoneplaytwod00myer }}\n* {{Cite book |last= Patoski |first= Joe Nick |title= The Dallas Cowboys: The Outrageous History of the Biggest, Loudest, Most Hated, Best Loved Football Team in America |year= 2012 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |ISBN= 978-0-316-07755-2 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/dallascowboysout0000pato }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Pearlman |first=Jeff |title=Boys Will Be Boys: The Glory Days and Party Nights of the Dallas Cowboys Dynasty |year=2008 |publisher=HarperCollins |ISBN=978-0-06-125680-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/boyswillbeboysgl00pear }}\n* {{Cite book |last=St. John |first=Bob |title=Landry: The Legend and the Legacy |year=2000 |publisher=Word Publishing |ISBN=0-8499-1670-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/landrylegendlega0000stjo }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Dallas Cowboys}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.nfl.com/teams/dallascowboys/profile?team=DAL Dallas Cowboys] at the [[National Football League]] official website\n\n{{Dallas Cowboys}}\n{{Navboxes\n|titlestyle = {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Dallas Cowboys|border=2}}\n|list =\n{{NFL}}\n{{Texas sports}}\n{{Dallas}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|American football|Texas}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dallas Cowboys| ]]\n[[Category:National Football League teams]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1960]]\n[[Category:1960 establishments in Texas]]\n", "name_user": "Sulfurboy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys"}

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.
