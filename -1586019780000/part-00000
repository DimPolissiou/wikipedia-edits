He was also a member of the groups [[Art Bears]], [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], and [[Skeleton Crew (band)|Skeleton Crew]]. He has collaborated with a number of prominent musicians, including [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[the Residents]], [[Lol Coxhill]], [[John Zorn]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Mike Patton]], [[Lars Hollmer]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Iva Bittov\u00e1]], [[Jad Fair]], [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]], the [[ARTE Quartett]], and [[Bob Ostertag]]. He has also composed several long works, including ''Traffic Continues'' (1996, performed 1998 by Frith and [[Ensemble Modern]]) and ''[[Freedom in Fragments]]'' (1993, performed 1999 by [[Rova Saxophone Quartet]]). Frith produces most of his own music, and has also produced many albums by other musicians, including [[Curlew (band)|Curlew]], [[the Muffins]], [[Etron Fou Leloublan]], and [[Orthotonics]].\n\nFrith is the subject of Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel's award-winning 1990 documentary ''[[Step Across the Border]]''. He also appears in the Canadian documentary ''[[Act of God (film)|Act of God]]'', which is about the metaphysical effects of being struck by lightning. Frith has contributed to a number of music publications, including ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' and ''[[Trouser Press]]'', and has conducted improvising workshops across the world. Frith's career spans over four decades and he appears on over 400 albums. He still performs actively throughout the world.<ref name=\"ff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fredfrith.com/concerts.htm |title=Current concert schedule |work=FredFrith.com |accessdate=22 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216054920/http://fredfrith.com/concerts.htm |archive-date=16 December 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrith was awarded the 2008 Demetrio Stratos Prize for his career achievements in experimental music.

He is the brother of [[Simon Frith]], a music critic and sociologist, and [[Chris Frith]], a psychologist at [[University College London]].\n\n==Musical career==\nFrith was born in [[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]] in Sussex, England<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/231/000029144/|title=Fred Frith|website=www.nndb.com|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> into a family where music was considered an essential part of life. He was given the nickname \"Fred\" at school after the motorcycle road racer [[Freddie Frith]].{{sfn|Piekut|2019|p=33}} Frith started violin lessons at the age of five and became a member of his school orchestra. But at 13 he switched to guitar after watching a group imitating a popular instrumental band at the time, [[the Shadows]]. He decided to learn how to play guitar and get into a band. Frith taught himself guitar from a book of [[guitar chord]]s and soon found himself in a school group called The Chaperones, playing Shadows and [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[cover band|covers]]. But when Frith started hearing [[blues]] music from the likes of [[Snooks Eaglin]] and [[Alexis Korner]] it changed his whole approach to the guitar, and by the time he was 15, The Chaperones had become a blues band. Frith's first public performances were in 1967 in [[folk club]]s in the North of England, where he sang and played traditional and blues songs.\n\nBesides the blues, Frith started listening to any music that had guitar in it, including [[Folk music|folk]], classical, [[ragtime]], and [[flamenco]]. He also listened to Indian, Japanese, and [[Bali]]nese music and was particularly drawn to [[Eastern Europe|East European]] music after a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] school friend taught him folk tunes from his home. Frith went to [[Cambridge University]] in 1967, where his musical horizons were expanded further by the philosophies of [[John Cage]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s manipulation of rock music. Frith graduated from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] with a BA ([[English literature]]) in 1970 (and by Cambridge custom received a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|pro forma MA]] in 1974),<ref name=FF-CV>{{cite web |url=http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/mus/frith/frith_cv.php |title=Fred Frith |date=18 September 2014 |publisher=[[Mills College]] |accessdate=22 October 2015 |archivedate=19 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919163915/http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/mus/frith/frith_cv.php |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> but the real significance of Cambridge for him was that that was where the seminal [[avant-rock]] group [[Henry Cow]] were formed.\n\n===Henry Cow===\n{{Main|Henry Cow}}\nFrith met [[Tim Hodgkinson]], a fellow student, in a blues club at Cambridge University in 1968. \"We'd never met before, and he had an alto sax, and I had my violin, and we just improvised this ghastly screaming noise for about half an hour.\"<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/interviews/int_frith.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215162125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/interviews/int_frith.shtml |archivedate=15 February 2006 |title=Fred Frith interview |work=BBC Music |accessdate=31 October 2008}}</ref> Something clicked and, recognizing their mutual open-minded approach to music, Frith and Hodgkinson formed a band there and then. They called it [[Henry Cow]] and they remained with the band until its demise in 1978. In the early 1970s Fred's grey Morris Minor sported the band's heraldic logo, much to the amusement of boys at his dad's grammar school in York where he was the headmaster.\n\nFrith composed a number of the band's notable pieces, including \"Nirvana for Mice\" and \"[[Ruins (instrumental)|Ruins]]\". While guitar was his principal instrument, he also played violin (drawing on his classical training), bass guitar, piano, and xylophone.\n\nIn November 1973, Frith (and other members of Henry Cow) participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's ''[[Elements \u2013 The Best of Mike Oldfield (video)|Elements]]'' DVD.\n\n===''Guitar Solos''===\n{{Main|Guitar Solos}}\nAfter Henry Cow's first album, Frith released ''[[Guitar Solos]]'' in 1974, his first solo album and a glimpse at what he had been doing with his guitar. The album comprised eight tracks of unaccompanied and [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] music played on [[prepared guitar]]s. It was recorded in four days, at the Kaleidophon Studios in London's [[Camden Town]], without any [[overdubbing]].\n\nWhen it was released, ''Guitar Solos'' was considered a landmark album<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=guitar-solos-mw0000611989|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Guitar Solos'' |work=AllMusic.com |first=Sean |last=Westergaard |accessdate=20 November 2006}}</ref> because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing. The January 1983 edition of ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine remarked that ''Guitar Solos'' \"...&nbsp;must have stunned listeners of the day. Even today that album stands up as uniquely innovative and undeniably daring.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\">\"The Frith Factor: Exploration in Sound\", ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, January 1983.</ref> It also attracted the attention of some \"famous\" musicians, including [[Brian Eno]], resulting in Frith playing guitar on two of Eno's albums, ''[[Before and After Science]]'' (1977) and ''[[Music for Films]]'' (1978).\n\nBetween October and December 1974, Frith contributed a series of ten articles to the British weekly music newspaper ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' entitled \"Great Rock Solos of Our Time\". In them he analysed prominent rock guitarists of the day and their contribution to the development of the rock guitar, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Frank Zappa]].{{sfn|Piekut|2019|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n===Post-Henry Cow===\nWhile recording Henry Cow's last album, differences emerged between the group members over the album's content. Frith and [[Chris Cutler]] favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and [[Lindsay Cooper]] wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, to release the songs already created on their own album, ''[[Hopes and Fears (Art Bears album)|Hopes and Fears]]'', under the name [[Art Bears]] (with [[Dagmar Krause]]). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on ''[[Western Culture (album)|Western Culture]]'' later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, ''[[Winter Songs (Art Bears album)|Winter Songs]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The World as It Is Today]]'' in 1981.\n\nDuring this time Frith also released ''[[Gravity (Fred Frith album)|Gravity]]'' (1980), his second solo album, recorded at Norrg\u00e5rden Nyvla in [[Uppsala]], Sweden with Swedish group [[Samla Mammas Manna]], and at the Catch-a-Buzz studio in [[Rockville, Maryland]] with United States band [[The Muffins]]. It showed Frith breaking free from the highly structured and orchestrated music of Henry Cow and experimenting with folk and dance music. \"Norrg\u00e5rden Nyvla\" was also the title of one of the tracks on the album and is considered one of Frith's most recognisable tunes.\n\n===New York===\n[[File:FredFrith October2005.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Fred Frith performing at [[Mills College]], [[Oakland, California]] in October 2005.]]\n\nTowards the end of 1979, Frith relocated to New York City, where he immediately hooked up with the local [[avant-garde]]/[[downtown music]] scene. The impact on him was uplifting: \"...&nbsp;New York was a profoundly liberating experience for me; for the first time I felt that I could be myself and not try to live up to what I imagined people were thinking about me.\"<ref name=\"paristransatlantic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/interviews/frith.html |title=Fred Frith interview, March 1998 |work=Paris Transatlantic Magazine |first=Dan |last=Warburton |accessdate=22 November 2006}}</ref> Frith met and began recording with a number of musicians and groups, including [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] (''[[With Friends Like These (album)|With Friends Like These]]'', ''[[Who Needs Enemies? (album)|Who Needs Enemies?]]''), [[Bob Ostertag]] (''[[Getting a Head]]'', ''[[Voice of America (Frith, Ostertag and Minton album)|Voice of America]]''), [[Tom Cora]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Zeena Parkins]], [[Ikue Mori]], [[the Residents]], [[Material (band)|Material]], [[the Golden Palominos]], and [[Curlew (band)|Curlew]]. He spent some 14 years in New York, during which time he joined a few bands, including [[John Zorn]]'s [[Naked City (band)|Naked City]] (in which Frith played bass) and [[French Frith Kaiser Thompson]] (consisting of [[John French (musician)|John French]], Frith, Henry Kaiser and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]). Frith also started three bands himself, namely [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], [[Skeleton Crew (band)|Skeleton Crew]], and [[Keep the Dog]].\n\nMassacre was formed in 1980 with bassist [[Bill Laswell]] and drummer [[Fred Maher]]. A high energy [[experimental rock]] band, they toured the United States and Europe in 1980 and 1981, and released one album, ''[[Killing Time (Massacre album)|Killing Time]]'' (1981), recorded at [[Martin Bisi]]'s later-to-be historic studio in [[Brooklyn]]. Massacre split in 1981 when Maher left, but later reformed again in 1998 when drummer [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] joined. The new Massacre released three more albums.\n\nSkeleton Crew, a collaboration with Tom Cora from 1982 to 1986, was an [[Experimental music|experimental]] group noted for its live improvisations where Frith (guitar, violin, keyboards, drums) and Cora (cello, bass guitar, homemade drums and contraptions) played a number of instruments simultaneously. They performed extensively across Europe, North America and Japan and released ''[[Learn to Talk]]'' in 1984. Zeena Parkins (electric harp and keyboards) joined in 1984 and the trio released ''[[The Country of Blinds]]'' in 1986. In October 1983 Skeleton Crew joined [[Duck and Cover (German band)|Duck and Cover]], a commission from the [[JazzFest Berlin|Berlin Jazz Festival]], for a performance in [[West Berlin]], followed by another in February 1984 in [[East Berlin]].\n\nFrith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a [[sextet]] and review band for performing selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions from the previous 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), [[Ren\u00e9 Lussier]] (guitar, bass guitar), [[Jean Derome]] (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and [[Kevin Norton]] (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former [[Soviet Union]]. A double CD, ''[[That House We Lived In]]'', from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.\n\n===Other projects===\nDuring the 1980s, Frith began writing music for dance, film, and theatre, and a number of his solo albums from this time reflect this genre, including ''[[The Technology of Tears|The Technology of Tears (And Other Music for Dance and Theatre)]]'' (1988), ''[[Middle of the Moment (soundtrack)|Middle of the Moment]]'' (1995), ''[[Allies (Fred Frith album)|Allies (Music for Dance, Volume 2)]]'' (1996), and ''[[Rivers and Tides (soundtrack)|Rivers and Tides]]'' (2003). Exploring new forms of composition, Frith also experimented with chance or accidental compositions, often created by building music around \"[[Found object (music)|found sounds]]\" and [[field recording]]s, examples of which can be found on ''[[Accidental (album)|Accidental (Music for Dance, Volume 3)]]'' (2002) and ''[[Prints (album)|Prints: Snapshots, Postcards, Messages and Miniatures, 1987\u20132001]]'' (2002).\n\n[[File:FredFrith August2006.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Fred Frith performing in [[Lisbon]] in August 2006.]]\n\nAs a composer, Frith began composing works for other musicians and groups in the late 1980s, including the [[Rova Saxophone Quartet]], [[Ensemble Modern]], and [[Arditti Quartet]]. In the late 1990s, Frith established his own [[Fred Frith Guitar Quartet]] consisting of Frith, [[Ren\u00e9 Lussier]], [[Nick Didkovsky]], and [[Mark Stewart (guitarist)|Mark Stewart]]. Their guitar music, varying from \"tuneful and pretty, to noisy, aggressive and quite challenging\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=851876 |title=Fred Frith Guitar Quartet |work=everything2.com |accessdate=31 October 2007}}</ref> appears on two albums, ''[[Ayaya Moses]]'' (1997) and ''[[Upbeat (album)|Upbeat]]'' (1999), both on Lussier's own [[Ambiances Magn\u00e9tiques]] label.\n\nThe ex-Henry Cow members have always maintained close contact with each other and Frith still collaborates with many of them, including Chris Cutler, Tim Hodgkinson, and Lindsay Cooper. Cutler and Frith have been touring Europe, Asia, and the Americas since 1978, and have given dozens of duo performances. Three albums from some of these concerts have been released by [[Recommended Records]]. In December 2006, Cutler, Frith, and Hodgkinson performed together at [[The Stone (music space)|the Stone]] in New York City, their first concert performance since Henry Cow's demise in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestonenyc.com/calendar.php |title=The Stone calendar |work=The Stone, New York City |accessdate=18 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://punkcast.com/1086/ |title=Fred Frith \u2013 Tim Hodgkinson \u2013 Chris Cutler, The Stone NYC, 16 December 2006 |work=Punkcast |accessdate=10 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Frith moved to [[Stuttgart]] in Germany to live with his wife, German photographer Heike Liss, and their children Finn and Lucia. Between 1994 and 1996, Frith was Composer-in-Residence at L'Ecole Nationale de Musique in [[Villeurbanne]], France.\n\nFrith relocated to the United States in 1997 to become Composer-in-Residence at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]]. In 1999 he was appointed the Luther B.

For the more structured and refined music he has often used a [[Gibson ES-335#Other|Gibson ES-345]], for example on his solo album, ''[[Gravity (Fred Frith album)|Gravity]]''. For the heavier \"rock\" sound, as in [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], he has used an old 1961 solid body Burns guitar, created by the British craftsman Jim Burns. On his landmark ''[[Guitar Solos]]'' album, Frith used a modified 1936 Gibson K-11 guitar (q.v. for details).\n\n[[File:FredFrith's setup April2009.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fred Frith's setup in April 2009.]]\n\nFor Frith's early unstructured music, as with [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] on ''[[With Friends Like These (album)|With Friends Like These]]'', and his early table-top guitar solo performances, he used a homemade six- and eight-string [[Multi-neck guitar|double-neck guitar]] created by a friend, Charles Fletcher. Frith told ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine in 1983: \"It was the one and only guitar that he ever built ... he constructed it mainly out of old pieces from other guitars that I had, and for the body I think he used an old door.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" /> The possibilities offered by homemade instruments prompted Frith to start creating his own guitars, basically slabs of wood on which he mounted a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], a [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]], and [[Strings (music)|strings]] stretched over metal screws. \"The basic design of the instrument is supposed to be as rudimentary and flexible as possible,\" Frith said, \"so I can use an electric drill to bore holes into the body of it to achieve certain sounds ... .\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" />\n\nFrith uses a variety of implements to play guitar, from traditional [[guitar pick]]s to [[Violin#Bows|violin bows]], [[Percussion mallet|drum stick]]s, egg beaters, paint brushes, lengths of metal chain, and other [[Found object (music)|found objects]]. Frith remarked: \"It's more to do with my interest in found objects and the use of certain kinds of textures which have an effect on the string ... the difference between the touch of stone, the touch of glass, the touch of wood, the touch of paper \u2013 those kinds of basic elements that you're using against the surface of the strings which produce different sounds.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" />\n\nIn a typical solo improvising concert, Frith would lay a couple of his homemade guitars flat on a table and play them with a collection of found objects (varying from concert to concert). He would drop objects, like [[ball bearing]]s, dried beans, and rice on the strings while stroking, scraping, and hitting them with whatever was on hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/36/32/art_music_groundzero.html |title=\"Ground Zero\", May 2002 |work=San Francisco Bay Guardian |first=Derk |last=Richardson |accessdate=22 November 2006}}</ref> Later he added a live [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] to his on-stage equipment, which he controlled with pedals. The sampler enabled him to dynamically capture and loop guitar sounds, over which he would capture and loop new sounds, and so on, until he had a bed of repeated patterns on top of which he would then begin his solo performance.\n\n=== Effects and amplification ===\n[[File:FredFrith April2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|210px|right|Fred Frith performing in [[Seattle]] in April 2009.]]\n;Effect pedals:\n*[[Pro Co RAT]] [[distortion]]\n*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] FV-50L volume foot controller\n*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] RC20-XL [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]\n*[[DigiTech]] [[Digitech Whammy|Whammy 4]]\n*[[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] DL4 delay\n*[[EBow]]\n*[[Electroharmonix POG]]\n;Amplification:\n*[[Fender Amplifiers]]\n\n==Compositions==\nSince the late 1980s, Fred Frith has composed a number of longer works.

He is the brother of [[Simon Frith]], a music critic and sociologist, and [[Chris Frith]], a psychologist at [[University College London]].\n\n==Musical career==\nFrith was born in [[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]] in Sussex, England<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/231/000029144/|title=Fred Frith|website=www.nndb.com|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> into a family where music was considered an essential part of life. He was given the nickname \"Fred\" at school after the motorcycle road racer [[Freddie Frith]].{{sfn|Piekut|2019|p=33}} Frith started violin lessons at the age of five and became a member of his school orchestra. But at 13 he switched to guitar after watching a group imitating a popular instrumental band at the time, [[the Shadows]]. He decided to learn how to play guitar and get into a band. Frith taught himself guitar from a book of [[guitar chord]]s and soon found himself in a school group called The Chaperones, playing Shadows and [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[cover band|covers]]. But when Frith started hearing [[blues]] music from the likes of [[Snooks Eaglin]] and [[Alexis Korner]] it changed his whole approach to the guitar, and by the time he was 15, The Chaperones had become a blues band. Frith's first public performances were in 1967 in [[folk club]]s in the North of England, where he sang and played traditional and blues songs.\n\nBesides the blues, Frith started listening to any music that had guitar in it, including [[Folk music|folk]], classical, [[ragtime]], and [[flamenco]]. He also listened to Indian, Japanese, and [[Bali]]nese music and was particularly drawn to [[Eastern Europe|East European]] music after a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] school friend taught him folk tunes from his home. Frith went to [[Cambridge University]] in 1967, where his musical horizons were expanded further by the philosophies of [[John Cage]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s manipulation of rock music. Frith graduated from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] with a BA ([[English literature]]) in 1970 (and by Cambridge custom received a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|pro forma MA]] in 1974),<ref name=FF-CV>{{cite web |url=http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/mus/frith/frith_cv.php |title=Fred Frith |date=18 September 2014 |publisher=[[Mills College]] |accessdate=22 October 2015 |archivedate=19 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919163915/http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/mus/frith/frith_cv.php |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> but the real significance of Cambridge for him was that that was where the seminal [[avant-rock]] group [[Henry Cow]] were formed.\n\n===Henry Cow===\n{{Main|Henry Cow}}\nFrith met [[Tim Hodgkinson]], a fellow student, in a blues club at Cambridge University in 1968. \"We'd never met before, and he had an alto sax, and I had my violin, and we just improvised this ghastly screaming noise for about half an hour.\"<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/interviews/int_frith.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215162125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/experimental/interviews/int_frith.shtml |archivedate=15 February 2006 |title=Fred Frith interview |work=BBC Music |accessdate=31 October 2008}}</ref> Something clicked and, recognizing their mutual open-minded approach to music, Frith and Hodgkinson formed a band there and then. They called it [[Henry Cow]] and they remained with the band until its demise in 1978. In the early 1970s Fred's grey Morris Minor sported the band's heraldic logo, much to the amusement of boys at his dad's grammar school in York where he was the headmaster.\n\nFrith composed a number of the band's notable pieces, including \"Nirvana for Mice\" and \"[[Ruins (instrumental)|Ruins]]\". While guitar was his principal instrument, he also played violin (drawing on his classical training), bass guitar, piano, and xylophone.\n\nIn November 1973, Frith (and other members of Henry Cow) participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's ''[[Elements \u2013 The Best of Mike Oldfield (video)|Elements]]'' DVD.\n\n===''Guitar Solos''===\n{{Main|Guitar Solos}}\nAfter Henry Cow's first album, Frith released ''[[Guitar Solos]]'' in 1974, his first solo album and a glimpse at what he had been doing with his guitar. The album comprised eight tracks of unaccompanied and [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] music played on [[prepared guitar]]s. It was recorded in four days, at the Kaleidophon Studios in London's [[Camden Town]], without any [[overdubbing]].\n\nWhen it was released, ''Guitar Solos'' was considered a landmark album<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=guitar-solos-mw0000611989|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Guitar Solos'' |work=AllMusic.com |first=Sean |last=Westergaard |accessdate=20 November 2006}}</ref> because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing. The January 1983 edition of ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine remarked that ''Guitar Solos'' \"...&nbsp;must have stunned listeners of the day. Even today that album stands up as uniquely innovative and undeniably daring.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\">\"The Frith Factor: Exploration in Sound\", ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, January 1983.</ref> It also attracted the attention of some \"famous\" musicians, including [[Brian Eno]], resulting in Frith playing guitar on two of Eno's albums, ''[[Before and After Science]]'' (1977) and ''[[Music for Films]]'' (1978).\n\nBetween October and December 1974, Frith contributed a series of ten articles to the British weekly music newspaper ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' entitled \"Great Rock Solos of Our Time\". In them he analysed prominent rock guitarists of the day and their contribution to the development of the rock guitar, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Frank Zappa]].{{sfn|Piekut|2019|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n===Post-Henry Cow===\nWhile recording Henry Cow's last album, differences emerged between the group members over the album's content. Frith and [[Chris Cutler]] favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and [[Lindsay Cooper]] wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, to release the songs already created on their own album, ''[[Hopes and Fears (Art Bears album)|Hopes and Fears]]'', under the name [[Art Bears]] (with [[Dagmar Krause]]). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on ''[[Western Culture (album)|Western Culture]]'' later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, ''[[Winter Songs (Art Bears album)|Winter Songs]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The World as It Is Today]]'' in 1981.\n\nDuring this time Frith also released ''[[Gravity (Fred Frith album)|Gravity]]'' (1980), his second solo album, recorded at Norrg\u00e5rden Nyvla in [[Uppsala]], Sweden with Swedish group [[Samla Mammas Manna]], and at the Catch-a-Buzz studio in [[Rockville, Maryland]] with United States band [[The Muffins]]. It showed Frith breaking free from the highly structured and orchestrated music of Henry Cow and experimenting with folk and dance music. \"Norrg\u00e5rden Nyvla\" was also the title of one of the tracks on the album and is considered one of Frith's most recognisable tunes.\n\n===New York===\n[[File:FredFrith October2005.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Fred Frith performing at [[Mills College]], [[Oakland, California]] in October 2005.]]\n\nTowards the end of 1979, Frith relocated to New York City, where he immediately hooked up with the local [[avant-garde]]/[[downtown music]] scene. The impact on him was uplifting: \"...&nbsp;New York was a profoundly liberating experience for me; for the first time I felt that I could be myself and not try to live up to what I imagined people were thinking about me.\"<ref name=\"paristransatlantic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/interviews/frith.html |title=Fred Frith interview, March 1998 |work=Paris Transatlantic Magazine |first=Dan |last=Warburton |accessdate=22 November 2006}}</ref> Frith met and began recording with a number of musicians and groups, including [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] (''[[With Friends Like These (album)|With Friends Like These]]'', ''[[Who Needs Enemies? (album)|Who Needs Enemies?]]''), [[Bob Ostertag]] (''[[Getting a Head]]'', ''[[Voice of America (Frith, Ostertag and Minton album)|Voice of America]]''), [[Tom Cora]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Zeena Parkins]], [[Ikue Mori]], [[the Residents]], [[Material (band)|Material]], [[the Golden Palominos]], and [[Curlew (band)|Curlew]]. He spent some 14 years in New York, during which time he joined a few bands, including [[John Zorn]]'s [[Naked City (band)|Naked City]] (in which Frith played bass) and [[French Frith Kaiser Thompson]] (consisting of [[John French (musician)|John French]], Frith, Henry Kaiser and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]). Frith also started three bands himself, namely [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], [[Skeleton Crew (band)|Skeleton Crew]], and [[Keep the Dog]].\n\nMassacre was formed in 1980 with bassist [[Bill Laswell]] and drummer [[Fred Maher]]. A high energy [[experimental rock]] band, they toured the United States and Europe in 1980 and 1981, and released one album, ''[[Killing Time (Massacre album)|Killing Time]]'' (1981), recorded at [[Martin Bisi]]'s later-to-be historic studio in [[Brooklyn]]. Massacre split in 1981 when Maher left, but later reformed again in 1998 when drummer [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] joined. The new Massacre released three more albums.\n\nSkeleton Crew, a collaboration with Tom Cora from 1982 to 1986, was an [[Experimental music|experimental]] group noted for its live improvisations where Frith (guitar, violin, keyboards, drums) and Cora (cello, bass guitar, homemade drums and contraptions) played a number of instruments simultaneously. They performed extensively across Europe, North America and Japan and released ''[[Learn to Talk]]'' in 1984. Zeena Parkins (electric harp and keyboards) joined in 1984 and the trio released ''[[The Country of Blinds]]'' in 1986. In October 1983 Skeleton Crew joined [[Duck and Cover (German band)|Duck and Cover]], a commission from the [[JazzFest Berlin|Berlin Jazz Festival]], for a performance in [[West Berlin]], followed by another in February 1984 in [[East Berlin]].\n\nFrith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a [[sextet]] and review band for performing selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions from the previous 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), [[Ren\u00e9 Lussier]] (guitar, bass guitar), [[Jean Derome]] (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and [[Kevin Norton]] (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former [[Soviet Union]]. A double CD, ''[[That House We Lived In]]'', from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.\n\n===Other projects===\nDuring the 1980s, Frith began writing music for dance, film, and theatre, and a number of his solo albums from this time reflect this genre, including ''[[The Technology of Tears|The Technology of Tears (And Other Music for Dance and Theatre)]]'' (1988), ''[[Middle of the Moment (soundtrack)|Middle of the Moment]]'' (1995), ''[[Allies (Fred Frith album)|Allies (Music for Dance, Volume 2)]]'' (1996), and ''[[Rivers and Tides (soundtrack)|Rivers and Tides]]'' (2003). Exploring new forms of composition, Frith also experimented with chance or accidental compositions, often created by building music around \"[[Found object (music)|found sounds]]\" and [[field recording]]s, examples of which can be found on ''[[Accidental (album)|Accidental (Music for Dance, Volume 3)]]'' (2002) and ''[[Prints (album)|Prints: Snapshots, Postcards, Messages and Miniatures, 1987\u20132001]]'' (2002).\n\n[[File:FredFrith August2006.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Fred Frith performing in [[Lisbon]] in August 2006.]]\n\nAs a composer, Frith began composing works for other musicians and groups in the late 1980s, including the [[Rova Saxophone Quartet]], [[Ensemble Modern]], and [[Arditti Quartet]]. In the late 1990s, Frith established his own [[Fred Frith Guitar Quartet]] consisting of Frith, [[Ren\u00e9 Lussier]], [[Nick Didkovsky]], and [[Mark Stewart (guitarist)|Mark Stewart]]. Their guitar music, varying from \"tuneful and pretty, to noisy, aggressive and quite challenging\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=851876 |title=Fred Frith Guitar Quartet |work=everything2.com |accessdate=31 October 2007}}</ref> appears on two albums, ''[[Ayaya Moses]]'' (1997) and ''[[Upbeat (album)|Upbeat]]'' (1999), both on Lussier's own [[Ambiances Magn\u00e9tiques]] label.\n\nThe ex-Henry Cow members have always maintained close contact with each other and Frith still collaborates with many of them, including Chris Cutler, Tim Hodgkinson, and Lindsay Cooper. Cutler and Frith have been touring Europe, Asia, and the Americas since 1978, and have given dozens of duo performances. Three albums from some of these concerts have been released by [[Recommended Records]]. In December 2006, Cutler, Frith, and Hodgkinson performed together at [[The Stone (music space)|the Stone]] in New York City, their first concert performance since Henry Cow's demise in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestonenyc.com/calendar.php |title=The Stone calendar |work=The Stone, New York City |accessdate=18 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://punkcast.com/1086/ |title=Fred Frith \u2013 Tim Hodgkinson \u2013 Chris Cutler, The Stone NYC, 16 December 2006 |work=Punkcast |accessdate=10 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Frith moved to [[Stuttgart]] in Germany to live with his wife, German photographer Heike Liss, and their children Finn and Lucia. Between 1994 and 1996, Frith was Composer-in-Residence at L'Ecole Nationale de Musique in [[Villeurbanne]], France.\n\nFrith relocated to the United States in 1997 to become Composer-in-Residence at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]]. In 1999 he was appointed the Luther B.

For the heavier \"rock\" sound, as in [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], he has used an old 1961 solid body Burns guitar, created by the British craftsman Jim Burns. On his landmark ''[[Guitar Solos]]'' album, Frith used a modified 1936 Gibson K-11 guitar (q.v. for details).\n\n[[File:FredFrith's setup April2009.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fred Frith's setup in April 2009.]]\n\nFor Frith's early unstructured music, as with [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] on ''[[With Friends Like These (album)|With Friends Like These]]'', and his early table-top guitar solo performances, he used a homemade six- and eight-string [[Multi-neck guitar|double-neck guitar]] created by a friend, Charles Fletcher. Frith told ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine in 1983: \"It was the one and only guitar that he ever built ... he constructed it mainly out of old pieces from other guitars that I had, and for the body I think he used an old door.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" /> The possibilities offered by homemade instruments prompted Frith to start creating his own guitars, basically slabs of wood on which he mounted a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], a [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]], and [[Strings (music)|strings]] stretched over metal screws. \"The basic design of the instrument is supposed to be as rudimentary and flexible as possible,\" Frith said, \"so I can use an electric drill to bore holes into the body of it to achieve certain sounds ... .\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" />\n\nFrith uses a variety of implements to play guitar, from traditional [[guitar pick]]s to [[Violin#Bows|violin bows]], [[Percussion mallet|drum stick]]s, egg beaters, paint brushes, lengths of metal chain, and other [[Found object (music)|found objects]]. Frith remarked: \"It's more to do with my interest in found objects and the use of certain kinds of textures which have an effect on the string ... the difference between the touch of stone, the touch of glass, the touch of wood, the touch of paper \u2013 those kinds of basic elements that you're using against the surface of the strings which produce different sounds.\"<ref name=\"downbeat\" />\n\nIn a typical solo improvising concert, Frith would lay a couple of his homemade guitars flat on a table and play them with a collection of found objects (varying from concert to concert). He would drop objects, like [[ball bearing]]s, dried beans, and rice on the strings while stroking, scraping, and hitting them with whatever was on hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/36/32/art_music_groundzero.html |title=\"Ground Zero\", May 2002 |work=San Francisco Bay Guardian |first=Derk |last=Richardson |accessdate=22 November 2006}}</ref> Later he added a live [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] to his on-stage equipment, which he controlled with pedals. The sampler enabled him to dynamically capture and loop guitar sounds, over which he would capture and loop new sounds, and so on, until he had a bed of repeated patterns on top of which he would then begin his solo performance.\n\n=== Effects and amplification ===\n[[File:FredFrith April2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|210px|right|Fred Frith performing in [[Seattle]] in April 2009.]]\n;Effect pedals:\n*[[Pro Co RAT]] [[distortion]]\n*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] FV-50L volume foot controller\n*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] RC20-XL [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]\n*[[DigiTech]] [[Digitech Whammy|Whammy 4]]\n*[[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] DL4 delay\n*[[EBow]]\n*[[Electroharmonix POG]]\n;Amplification:\n*[[Fender Amplifiers]]\n\n==Compositions==\nSince the late 1980s, Fred Frith has composed a number of longer works.

The name change is in accordance with the proposal of the Governor of Central Borneo, and recommendations / responses of [[Minister of the Interior]].\nThe prescription of the name is because [[Tjilik Riwut]] is a National Hero ''(Dekrit Presiden Republik Indonesia tanggal 6 November 1988, No.108 / TK / 1988).''\n\nOn 28 March 2019 the airport's new terminal began operations, all flight activities at the airport's old terminal were moved to the new airport terminal.\n\nThen on 8 April 2019 the new terminal of Tjilik Riwut Airport was inaugurated by [[President of the Republic of Indonesia]] [[Joko Widodo]].\n\n==Terminal facilities==\n\nThe capacity of the airport has increased after the new terminal was officially inaugurated on 28 March 2019. The total terminal capacity at that time was 15,000 square meters, able to serve 1,000 passengers daily. The terminal was extended further with an area of 29,124 square meters; the double level terminal can now serve 2,200 passengers daily.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2019/04/12/new-terminal-at-tjilik-riwut-airport-ready-for-operation.html|title=New terminal at Tjilik Riwut Airport ready for operation|newspaper=The Jakarta PostNews|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are a few shops and restaurants in the terminal to serve the passengers. The airport has its own taxi service for arrival passengers; alternative local taxi and transport companies such as [[Grab (company)|Grab]], [[Gojek|GoJek]] and small local buses (''angkot'') are not permitted to collect passengers from the airport.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n\n{{airport-dest-list\n<!-- According to WP:AIRPORTS \"Do not separate flights into domestic (national) and international.\" -->\n| [[Aviastar (Indonesia)|Aviastar]] | [[South Barito Regency|Buntok]], [[Gunung Mas Regency|Kuala Kurun]], [[Seruyan Regency|Kuala Pembuang]], [[Beringin Airport|Muara Teweh]], [[Iskandar Airport|Pangkalan Bun]], [[Murung Raya Regency|Puruk Cahu]], [[Katingan Regency|Tumbang Samba]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Batik Air]] | [[Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport|Jakarta\u2013Soekarno\u2013Hatta]], [[Juanda International Airport|Surabaya]],<ref name=LA>https://agent.lionair.co.id/LionAirAgentsPortal/Default.aspx</ref> [[Yogyakarta International Airport|Yogyakarta\u2013International]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Citilink]] | [[Juanda International Airport|Surabaya]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Garuda Indonesia]] |[[Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport|Jakarta\u2013Soekarno\u2013Hatta]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Lion Air]] | [[Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport|Jakarta\u2013Soekarno\u2013Hatta]], [[Juanda International Airport|Surabaya]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[NAM Air]] | [[Adisumarmo International Airport|Surakarta/Solo]]<ref>http://m.rri.co.id/surakarta/post/berita/788867/ekonomi/nam_air_pindah_rute_penerbangan_dari_solo_mana_saja_rutenya.html</ref><ref>https://m.solopos.com/nam-air-buka-rute-anyar-dari-bandara-adi-soemarmo-ke-luar-jawa-mana-saja-1046501</ref>\n| [[Susi Air]]|[[Beringin Airport|Muara Teweh]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[TransNusa]]|[[Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport|Balikpapan]], [[Iskandar Airport|Pangkalan Bun]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Wings Air]]|[[Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport|Balikpapan]], [[Syamsudin Noor International Airport|Banjarmasin]], [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|Makassar]],<ref name=LA /> [[Supadio International Airport|Pontianak]],<ref>https://m.antaranews.com/berita/1351842/lion-air-hubungkan-kalbar-kalteng-dukung-kemajuan-ekonomi-daerah?utm_source=antaranews&utm_medium=mobile&utm_campaign=related_news</ref><ref>https://www.m.jpnn.com/amp/news/wings-air-akan-layani-rute-pontianak-ke-palangkaraya</ref><ref>https://bisnis.tempo.co/amp/1318936/april-lion-air-buka-rute-penerbangan-pontianak-palangkaraya</ref><ref>https://www.airmagz.com/56154/wings-air-akan-buka-rute-pontianak-ke-palangkaraya.html</ref><ref>https://www.suaramerdeka.com/amp/news/ekonomi-dan-bisnis/221569-wings-air-akan-buka-rute-pontianak-ke-palangkaraya</ref> [[H.

Air disturbance in the aircraft cabin was only discovered when the aircraft carrying 96 people had taken off from [[Palangkaraya]], at 08.04 WIB. After being in the air for about 10 minutes the pilot decided to return to base on the grounds of technical problems.\n* 30 September 2011: [[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] Aiming for [[Jakarta]] to [[Palangkaraya]], failed to land due to fog in the [[Palangkaraya]]. This incident was caused due to Smoky Weather and Pilot Distance. The pilots finally decided to land at [[Syamsudin Noor Airport]] in [[Banjarmasin]].\n* 22 April 2012: [[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800NG]] with flight number GA 550 bumps into an [[Eagle]] while on its way to land at [[Palangka Raya]]. There were no fatalities in this incident, but the muzzle of the plane that was hit by the Eagle was damaged. And the flight to [[Jakarta]] was delayed, and the passenger to [[Jakarta]] departed at 20:00 Local Time, with a Flight Replacement from [[Jakarta]].\n* 22 September 2012: [[Lion Air]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-900ER]] that was chartered by a contingent of [[Central Borneo]] contingents on PON XVIII had failed to land at [[Palangka Raya]],  00.15am Local Time. This incident occurred when the plane had touched the runway, but the plane flew back and circled in the air for 45 minutes, and then the plane landed again in this airport. This incident happened because this Chartered Flight and pilot had never landed in [[Palangkaraya]] even at night.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://indonesiaairport.com/provinces/kalimantan/tjilik_riwut_airport.htm Tjilik Riwut Airport - Indonesia Airport Global Website]\n* {{ASN|PKY}}\n\n{{Airports in Indonesia}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Palangkaraya]]\n[[Category:Airports in Central Kalimantan]]\n", "name_user": "Meandkancil2020", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePassenger:No Officials Sources that Say NAM Air Open Surakarta-Palangkaraya Route .", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjilik_Riwut_Airport"}

The [[city centre]] has a population of approximately 70,000, while the [[urban area]] counts around 250,000 inhabitants.<ref>taken from \"Annuario statistico italiano 2008\" {{ISBN|978-88-458-1595-9}}</ref> It is the capital of the [[Province of Cosenza]]. The demonym of Cosenza in English is Cosentian.\n\nThe ancient town is the seat of the [[Cosentian Academy]], one of the oldest academies of philosophical and literary studies in Italy and [[Europe]]. To this day, the city remains a cultural hub, with museums, theatres, libraries, and the [[University of Calabria]].\n\n== Geography and Climate ==\n[[File:Viale Parco.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Old Town in the snow]]\n[[File:Piazza XI Settembre 2016- Cosenza.jpg|thumb|left|Piazza XI Settembre in the snow]]\n[[File:Fiume crati cosenza.jpg|thumb|left|The River Crati in Cosenza]]\n\nLocated at the confluence of two ancient rivers, the [[Busento]] and the [[Crati]], Cosenza stands 238&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in a valley between the [[La Sila|Sila]] plateau and the coastal range of mountains. The old town, overshadowed by its Swabian castle, descends to the river Crati. The modern city lies to the north, beyond the Busento, on level ground.\n\nAlmost completely surrounded by mountains, Cosenza is subject to a microclimate scarcely influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, with cold winters and hot summers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe ancient '''Consentia''' ({{lang-grc|\u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}})<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:6.1.5 Strabo, Geography, \u00a76.1.5]</ref>, capital of the Italic tribe of the [[Bruttii]], was a bulwark of the [[Italic people]] against the [[Hellenic civilization|Hellenic]] influences of the Ionian colonies. It was in this province that the [[Battle of Pandosia]] was fought, in which a small Italic army composed of Bruttii and [[Lucanians]] defeated [[Alexander the Great]]'s uncle, [[Alexander of Epirus]].  Over the centuries, Cosenza maintained a distinctive character, which marked it out among the cities of the region. Under Emperor [[Augustus]] it became an important stopover on the Roman route [[via Popilia]], which connected Calabria to [[Sicily]]. During the Roman Empire, although merely a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', the town benefited from municipal privileges.\n\n===Alaric's legendary tomb===\n[[File:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|Death of [[Alaric I]], buried in the bed of the River [[Busento]]]]\n\nIn 410 AD [[Alaric I]], king of the [[Visigoths]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city of Rome]] and became the first foreign enemy to capture the city in over 800 years. After leaving Rome, Alaric had amassed a great amount of treasure from his conquest of the city.\n \nAccording to the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]],<ref>Jordanes, ''De origine actibusque Getarum'' (551), taken up by [[Edward Gibbon]], '' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', chapter 31.</ref> After sacking Rome Alaric left and headed south with his troops until reaching the area of Cosenza, where he died. No one is certain how this happened: Some believe he contracted a disease that took his life, while others feel that his death came from an attack by enemy forces. In any case, his troops honored their king by burying him in a tomb in the city. His burial place is said to have been at the confluence of the [[Busento]] and [[Crati|Crathis]] rivers. A horde of slaves were used to divert the water from the Busento, allowing them to dig a tomb large enough for Alaric, his horse and all of the treasure amassed from his conquests in Rome. Once the tomb was completed, the river was returned to its bed and the tomb covered with water. Then, to ensure that no one would reveal this location to anyone, Alaric's troops killed all of the slaves.\n\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, several towns in the Cosenza province, most notably [[Rossano]], refused to acknowledge the new governments of the Visigoths. Instead, they used their fortune of having strong city walls and small Roman garrisons to hold out for centuries as semi-independent enclaves of the still existent [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in Italy. For that reason, Cosenza was viewed as [[Byzantine]] territory until the invasion of the Germanic [[Lombards]] in the 560s.\n\n===Norman, Hohenstaufen and Angevin period===\n\nBitterly disputed between the [[Saracens]] and the [[Lombards]], the town was destroyed, then rebuilt around 988; only to be ravaged again in the early 11th century. In the attempt to escape the devastation, the population left the town and sheltered on the surrounding hills where they built some small hamlets (still denominated ''casali'').\n\nBy the first half of the eleventh century, Lombard Calabria became a feudal dukedom of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans]], with Cosenza as capital. The town soon rebelled against the rule of [[Roger Guiscard]] and was only recaptured after a long siege. Subsequently, under the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule, the town became the seat of the Court of Calabria (''Curia Generale''). The Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] had a particular interest in the town: he promoted construction and economic activities, organising an important annual fair.\n\nSubsequently, Cosenza fought bitterly against the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] domination, supported by the clergy. While the uprising spread through the valley of the Crathis, the town was involved in the see-sawing fight between [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevins]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1432 King [[Louis III of Anjou]] settled in the castle of Cosenza with his wife [[Margaret of Savoy (1410\u20131479)|Margaret of Savoy]]. When he died untimely, in 1434, he was buried in the Cathedral.\n\n[[File:teatrorendano.jpg|thumb|right|Rendano Theatre]]\n\n===Spanish domination===\n\nIn 1500, in spite of resistance, Cosenza was occupied by the Spanish army led by Captain [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]]. During the sixteenth century the town experienced a period of expansion as the seat of the Viceroy of Calabria. At the same time its cultural importance grew thanks to the foundation of the [[Cosentian Academy|Accademia Cosentina]]; among its most renowned members were [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Aulo Gianni Parrasio]], the Martirano brothers, [[Antonio Serra]] and others. \nIn 1707 the Austrians succeeded the Spanish in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], followed by the Bourbons. After the proclamation in 1799 of the short-lived [[Parthenopean Republic]] and a vain resistance, the town was finally occupied for the Bourbons by [[Fabrizio Ruffo|Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo]]\u2019s ''Lazzari''; Cardinal Ruffo was native of the province of Cosenza.\n\n===Modern age===\n\nFrom 1806 to 1815 Cosenza fought hard against French domination. Cruel suppressions characterised that period and in 1813 the town, a cradle of the [[Carbonari]] secret societies, saw many rebels executed. The local riots of 1821 and 1837 heralded the [[Risorgimento]]. They were followed by the uprising of 15 March 1844, which reached its climax with the \u201cnoble folly\u201d of the [[Bandiera Brothers]], who were executed together with some of their followers in the Vallone di Rovito in Cosenza. In 1860, some months after the rapid and overwhelmingly heroic deeds of Garibaldi's troops, a plebiscite proclaimed the annexation of Calabria to the new Kingdom of Italy.\n[[File:Statua di Alarico 1.jpg|thumb|Church of San Domenico]]\n[[File:Cosenza-Duomo.JPG|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral]]\n[[File:Biblioteca Civica.jpg|thumb|Civic Library]]\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Cosenza}}\n\n==Main sights==\n===Church of San Domenico===\n\nFounded in 1448, the church combines Renaissance and Medieval elements. Its most interesting feature is the rose window defined by 16 little [[tuff]]<!--NOT tufa--> columns. The wooden portal (1614) is inlaid with floral motifs, figures of saints and coats of arms.\n \nInside the church are works by the Cosentian painter A. Granata (late 18th century): ''Santa Rosa, Santa Caterina, San Ludovico, San Giacinto'' and ''San Domenico''. The high altar is made of polychrome marble (1767). In the transept, there is  a ''Deposition'' and a ''San Vincenzo Ferreri'' (late 18th century, anonymous). The sacristy is noted for its ribbed vault, a double lancet window with a narrow arch and a wooden choir installed in 1635.\n\n===The Cathedral===\n\nThe exact origins of the [[Duomo]] are unknown; it was probably built during the first half of the 11th century. An earthquake destroyed the cathedral on 9 June 1184, and rebuilding was completed by 1222 when the cathedral was consecrated by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]]. At some point during the first half of the 18th century the church was covered by a baroque superstructure which obliterated the original structure and its works of art. In the first half of the 19th century the fa\u00e7ade was transformed in neo-gothic style, which completely changed its character. At the end of the 19th century, Archbishop Camillo Sorgente entrusted the work to Pisanti, who recovered the original old arches and the ancient structure of the church. In the 1940s the work was finally completed. \nIn the transept is the tomb of [[Isabella of Aragon, Queen of France|Isabella of Aragon]], wife of king  [[Philip III of France]]. A long aisle links the Duomo to the archbishops' palace, the ''Palazzo Arcivescovile'', which houses an ''Immacolata'' by [[Luca Giordano]]. One can also admire the rare and precious ''Stauroteca'', a gift from [[Emperor Frederick II]] to the Duomo upon consecration. The work was produced in the royal goldsmiths' workshops, better known as \u201cTiraz\u201d, in a cultural environment which blended Arabic, Byzantine and Western cultural elements.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, the Cathedral of Cosenza received the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site for being \"Heritage Witness to a Culture of Peace\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youritaly.com/Guide_Turistiche/CITIES_OF_ART/Cosenza_City|title=Youritaly.it - Portal for tourism and recreation in Italy|author=|date=|website=Youritaly.it|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062738/http://www.youritaly.com/Guide_Turistiche/CITIES_OF_ART/Cosenza_City|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.italy-holiday.com/calabria/Cosenza|title=Cosenza - Calabria: Your holiday in Italy|author=|date=|website=en.italy-holiday.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\nThis is the first award given by UNESCO to the region of Calabria.\n\n===''Monastero delle Vergini''===\n\nIn via Gaetano Argento stands the \"Convent of the Virgins\". The external part of the main entrance is made of decorated tuff, while the internal part is carved of wood. The convent contains a 16th-century painting of the ''Annunciation''. In front of it, is the 13th-century ''Madonna del Pilerio'' attributed to [[Giovanni da Taranto]], while on the walls are four other anonymous 16th-century paintings: the ''Visitation'', the ''Circumcision'', the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' and the ''Adoration of the Magi''. In the apse is the altarpiece ''Transit of the Virgin'' (1570). The [[cymatium]] houses a painting portraying the ''Coronation of the Virgin'', while at the base of the two columns are paintings, attributed to Michele Curia, the \"Master of Montecalvario\", of two unidentified saints. The wooden choir dates to the 17th century.\n\n===''Giostra Vecchia''===\nIn the fifteenth century, at Palazzo Falvo the [[Renaissance]] was introduced at Cosenza, in the ''Giostra Vecchia''.  Here are located the church and monastery of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. The [[Latin cross]] plan has a nave and two aisles. In the nave stands the impressive high wooden altar built in 1700. Above it is a painting by Daniele Russo representing the ''Perdono d\u2019Assisi ''(1618). The left aisle is home to a wooden 17th-century crucifix, the altar of the ''Madonna della Febbre'' and the statue of the ''Madonna with Child'', in marble, dating to the 16th century. The sacristy has a painted wooden ceiling, a wooden ''armadio'' representing episodes from the Passion of Christ and pictures of saints and Franciscan friars. The stone arch is characterized by the painting of [[St. Francis of Paola]], while on the walls are some frescoes dating to the beginning of the 15th century.\n\n===Hohenstaufen Castle===\n[[File:Hohenstaufen Castle (small).jpg|thumb|left|Hohenstaufen Castle]]\n[[File:Palazzo Arnone.jpg|thumb|Palazzo Arnone, National Gallery]]\n[[File:Bilotti.jpg|thumb|Open Air Museum]]\n[[File:Bagnante1 jpg.jpg|thumb|''The Bather'', by Emilio Greco]]\n\nThe ''Castello Svevo'' (\"Swabian\" or [[Hohenstaufen]] Castle) was originally built by the Saracens on the ruins of the ancient Rocca Brutia, around the year 1000. The castle was restored by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], adding the octagonal tower to the original structure, in 1239. According to tradition, his son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry]] lived in this castle, as a prisoner at his father's command. [[Louis III of Naples]] and Margaret of Savoy married in the castle and they both settled there in 1432.\n\nAll signs of the ancient Saracen structure have now disappeared. In the internal cloister, the modifications made by the [[Bourbons]] in order to convert it into a prison can also be seen. The entrance-hall is covered by ogival arches with engraved brackets. A wide corridor is dominated by some [[fleur-de-lis]] from the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]]  [[coat of arms]]. They are engraved on the ribbed Hohenstaufen arches.\n\n===''Spirito Santo''===\nThe church of ''Sant'Agostino'', also known as the ''Spirito Santo'', was built in 1507 by the [[Augustinians]]. The original portal has several inscriptions in Gothic characters. The interior has a series of paintings from the eighteenth century. Further on a narrow street leads to the so-called \u201cArea of the [[Bandiera Brothers]]\u201d, the ''Vallone di Rovito''. Here, the insurrectional patriots of 1844 were executed by a firing squad.\n\n===''San Francesco di Paola''===\nIn the Arenella, are the Church and Monastery of [[Saint Francis of Paola]] (1510). The interior, with a single nave, houses the tomb of Ottavio Cesare Gaeta. On the right wall, are two 18th-century paintings: a ''Sacra Famiglia'' and ''Madonna con San Francesco e Sant\u2019Agostino''. On an altar is a wooden statue of Saint Francis of Paola; while on the left side of the nave, on another altar, is a wooden statue of San Michele Arcangelo. The ''Madonna with Child in Glory and Saints Paul and Luke'' (1551) was painted by [[Pietro Negroni]]. In the apse, a 16th-century triptych made by Cristoforo Faffeo represents the ''Madonna and Child in glory with saints Catherine and Sebastian''. At the back of the altar is a wooden choir built in 1679 by M. Domenico Costanzo da Rogliano. On the wall of the sacristy are remains of frescoes dating back to 1550\u20131600. On the vault are some pastels<!--probably faded frescoes?--> representing scenes from the life of the Saint from Paola.\n\n===''San Salvatore''===\nThe small church of San Salvatore serves the parish which professes the Byzantine-Albanian faith. Inside the nave are a wooden ceiling, some frescoes of the Apostoli, of the Salvatore and of the Madonna, as well as a splendid [[iconostasis]].\n\n===Open Air Museum===\n\nIn the modern part of Cosenza, in an area stretching from the pedestrianized Corso Mazzini to Piazza Bilotti, lies the open-air \"Museo MAB\" (''Museo all'aperto Bilotti''). The museum hosts a wide range of modern art sculptures that stand in the street for residents and tourists. The sculptures were donated to the city by the Italian-American entrepreneur and art collector, Carlo Bilotti. They include ''Saint George and the Dragon'' by [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], ''Hector and Andromache'' by [[Giorgio de Chirico]], \"the Bronzes\" by [[Sacha Sosno]], ''The Bather'' by [[Emilio Greco]], ''The Cardinal'' by [[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]] and various marble sculptures by [[Pietro Consagra]].\n\n=== Museums and cultural institutions ===\n\n* National Gallery - Palazzo Arnone\n* Civic Archeological Museum \n* Remembrance Museum \n* Bilotti Open Air Museum\n* [http://museocentrostorico.cs.it/index.html Museo Storico all'Aperto] \n* Rendano Theatre \n* Morelli Theatre \n* Acquario Theatre \n* [[Cosentian Academy]]\n* [[University of Calabria]] \n* Music Conservatoire \n* State Archive Library \n* Civic Library \n* National Library \n* District Library \n* Children's Library  \n* Antonio Guarasci Foundation Library \n* Calabria Jazz Centre Recordings Archive \n* Theological Library (Seminario cosentino)\n* Cultural and Ethno-Anthropological Heritage Archive\n\n== Events and festivals ==\n*Fiera di S.Giuseppe - March\n*Festival delle Invasioni - July\n*Festa del Cioccolato (Chocolate Festival) - October\n*''La sagra dell'uva e del vino'' (Wine Festival) in Donnici - October\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n* [[Joachim of Fiore]] (theologian, c.1135-1202)\n* [[Aulo Giano Parrasio]] (humanist, 1470\u20131521)\n* [[Bernardino Telesio]] (philosopher, 1509\u20131588)\n* [[Pietro Negroni]] (painter, 1505\u20131565)\n* [[Antonio Serra]] (economist, late 16th century)\n* [[Sertorio Quattromani]] (philosopher, 1541\u20131607)\n* [[ Niccol\u00f2 Pasquali (musician, 1717/18\u20131757)\n* [[ Francis Pasquali (musician, fl.1743\u20131795)\n* [[Francesco Saverio Salfi]] (writer, 1759\u20131832)\n* [[Nicola Misasi]] (writer, 1850\u20131923)\n* [[Alfonso Rendano]] (pianist, 1853\u20131931)\n* [[Alessandro Longo]] (composer, 1864\u20131945)\n* [[Pietro Mancini]] (politician, 1876\u20131968)\n* [[Fausto Gullo]] (politician, 1887\u20131974)\n* [[Stefano Rodot\u00e0]] (politician, 1933-2017)\n* [[Sandra Savaglio]] (astrophysicist, born 1967)\n* [[Maria Perrotta]] (pianist, born 1974)\n* [[Stefano Fiore]] (footballer, born 1975)\n* [[Maria Perrusi]] (Miss Italia 2009)\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities===\nCosenza is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|Wisconsin}} [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], United States, since 1979<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kenosha.org/mayor/sister_cities.html|title=Sister Cities - City of Kenosha|first=Super|last=User|date=|website=www.kenosha.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Michigan}} [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States, since 2000<ref name=\"Lansing, Michigan - Sister Cities\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lansingmi.gov/live/sister_cities.jsp |title=Living Here &#124; Sister Cities &#124; City of Lansing, Michigan |publisher=Lansingmi.gov |accessdate=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028000120/http://www.lansingmi.gov/live/sister_cities.jsp |archivedate=2012-10-28 }}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Ontario}} [[Sault Ste.

The [[city centre]] has a population of approximately 70,000, while the [[urban area]] counts around 250,000 inhabitants.<ref>taken from \"Annuario statistico italiano 2008\" {{ISBN|978-88-458-1595-9}}</ref> It is the capital of the [[Province of Cosenza]]. The demonym of Cosenza in English is Cosentian.\n\nThe ancient town is the seat of the [[Cosentian Academy]], one of the oldest academies of philosophical and literary studies in Italy and [[Europe]]. To this day, the city remains a cultural hub, with museums, theatres, libraries, and the [[University of Calabria]].\n\n== Geography and Climate ==\n[[File:Viale Parco.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Old Town in the snow]]\n[[File:Piazza XI Settembre 2016- Cosenza.jpg|thumb|left|Piazza XI Settembre in the snow]]\n[[File:Fiume crati cosenza.jpg|thumb|left|The River Crati in Cosenza]]\n\nLocated at the confluence of two ancient rivers, the [[Busento]] and the [[Crati]], Cosenza stands 238&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in a valley between the [[La Sila|Sila]] plateau and the coastal range of mountains. The old town, overshadowed by its Swabian castle, descends to the river Crati. The modern city lies to the north, beyond the Busento, on level ground.\n\nAlmost completely surrounded by mountains, Cosenza is subject to a microclimate scarcely influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, with cold winters and hot summers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe ancient '''Consentia''' ({{lang-grc|\u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}})<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:6.1.5 Strabo, Geography, \u00a76.1.5]</ref>, capital of the Italic tribe of the [[Bruttii]], was a bulwark of the [[Italic people]] against the [[Hellenic civilization|Hellenic]] influences of the Ionian colonies. It was in this province that the [[Battle of Pandosia]] was fought, in which a small Italic army composed of Bruttii and [[Lucanians]] defeated [[Alexander the Great]]'s uncle, [[Alexander of Epirus]].  Over the centuries, Cosenza maintained a distinctive character, which marked it out among the cities of the region. Under Emperor [[Augustus]] it became an important stopover on the Roman route [[via Popilia]], which connected Calabria to [[Sicily]]. During the Roman Empire, although merely a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', the town benefited from municipal privileges.\n\n===Alaric's legendary tomb===\n[[File:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|Death of [[Alaric I]], buried in the bed of the River [[Busento]]]]\n\nIn 410 AD [[Alaric I]], king of the [[Visigoths]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city of Rome]] and became the first foreign enemy to capture the city in over 800 years. After leaving Rome, Alaric had amassed a great amount of treasure from his conquest of the city.\n \nAccording to the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]],<ref>Jordanes, ''De origine actibusque Getarum'' (551), taken up by [[Edward Gibbon]], '' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', chapter 31.</ref> After sacking Rome Alaric left and headed south with his troops until reaching the area of Cosenza, where he died. No one is certain how this happened: Some believe he contracted a disease that took his life, while others feel that his death came from an attack by enemy forces. In any case, his troops honored their king by burying him in a tomb in the city. His burial place is said to have been at the confluence of the [[Busento]] and [[Crati|Crathis]] rivers. A horde of slaves were used to divert the water from the Busento, allowing them to dig a tomb large enough for Alaric, his horse and all of the treasure amassed from his conquests in Rome. Once the tomb was completed, the river was returned to its bed and the tomb covered with water. Then, to ensure that no one would reveal this location to anyone, Alaric's troops killed all of the slaves.\n\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, several towns in the Cosenza province, most notably [[Rossano]], refused to acknowledge the new governments of the Visigoths. Instead, they used their fortune of having strong city walls and small Roman garrisons to hold out for centuries as semi-independent enclaves of the still existent [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in Italy. For that reason, Cosenza was viewed as [[Byzantine]] territory until the invasion of the Germanic [[Lombards]] in the 560s.\n\n===Norman, Hohenstaufen and Angevin period===\n\nBitterly disputed between the [[Saracens]] and the [[Lombards]], the town was destroyed, then rebuilt around 988; only to be ravaged again in the early 11th century. In the attempt to escape the devastation, the population left the town and sheltered on the surrounding hills where they built some small hamlets (still denominated ''casali'').\n\nBy the first half of the eleventh century, Lombard Calabria became a feudal dukedom of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans]], with Cosenza as capital. The town soon rebelled against the rule of [[Roger Guiscard]] and was only recaptured after a long siege. Subsequently, under the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule, the town became the seat of the Court of Calabria (''Curia Generale''). The Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] had a particular interest in the town: he promoted construction and economic activities, organising an important annual fair.\n\nSubsequently, Cosenza fought bitterly against the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] domination, supported by the clergy. While the uprising spread through the valley of the Crathis, the town was involved in the see-sawing fight between [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevins]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1432 King [[Louis III of Anjou]] settled in the castle of Cosenza with his wife [[Margaret of Savoy (1410\u20131479)|Margaret of Savoy]]. When he died untimely, in 1434, he was buried in the Cathedral.\n\n[[File:teatrorendano.jpg|thumb|right|Rendano Theatre]]\n\n===Spanish domination===\n\nIn 1500, in spite of resistance, Cosenza was occupied by the Spanish army led by Captain [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]]. During the sixteenth century the town experienced a period of expansion as the seat of the Viceroy of Calabria. At the same time its cultural importance grew thanks to the foundation of the [[Cosentian Academy|Accademia Cosentina]]; among its most renowned members were [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Aulo Gianni Parrasio]], the Martirano brothers, [[Antonio Serra]] and others. \nIn 1707 the Austrians succeeded the Spanish in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], followed by the Bourbons. After the proclamation in 1799 of the short-lived [[Parthenopean Republic]] and a vain resistance, the town was finally occupied for the Bourbons by [[Fabrizio Ruffo|Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo]]\u2019s ''Lazzari''; Cardinal Ruffo was native of the province of Cosenza.\n\n===Modern age===\n\nFrom 1806 to 1815 Cosenza fought hard against French domination. Cruel suppressions characterised that period and in 1813 the town, a cradle of the [[Carbonari]] secret societies, saw many rebels executed. The local riots of 1821 and 1837 heralded the [[Risorgimento]]. They were followed by the uprising of 15 March 1844, which reached its climax with the \u201cnoble folly\u201d of the [[Bandiera Brothers]], who were executed together with some of their followers in the Vallone di Rovito in Cosenza. In 1860, some months after the rapid and overwhelmingly heroic deeds of Garibaldi's troops, a plebiscite proclaimed the annexation of Calabria to the new Kingdom of Italy.\n[[File:Statua di Alarico 1.jpg|thumb|Church of San Domenico]]\n[[File:Cosenza-Duomo.JPG|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral]]\n[[File:Biblioteca Civica.jpg|thumb|Civic Library]]\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Cosenza}}\n\n==Main sights==\n===Church of San Domenico===\n\nFounded in 1448, the church combines Renaissance and Medieval elements. Its most interesting feature is the rose window defined by 16 little [[tuff]]<!--NOT tufa--> columns. The wooden portal (1614) is inlaid with floral motifs, figures of saints and coats of arms.\n \nInside the church are works by the Cosentian painter A. Granata (late 18th century): ''Santa Rosa, Santa Caterina, San Ludovico, San Giacinto'' and ''San Domenico''. The high altar is made of polychrome marble (1767). In the transept, there is  a ''Deposition'' and a ''San Vincenzo Ferreri'' (late 18th century, anonymous). The sacristy is noted for its ribbed vault, a double lancet window with a narrow arch and a wooden choir installed in 1635.\n\n===The Cathedral===\n\nThe exact origins of the [[Duomo]] are unknown; it was probably built during the first half of the 11th century. An earthquake destroyed the cathedral on 9 June 1184, and rebuilding was completed by 1222 when the cathedral was consecrated by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]]. At some point during the first half of the 18th century the church was covered by a baroque superstructure which obliterated the original structure and its works of art. In the first half of the 19th century the fa\u00e7ade was transformed in neo-gothic style, which completely changed its character. At the end of the 19th century, Archbishop Camillo Sorgente entrusted the work to Pisanti, who recovered the original old arches and the ancient structure of the church. In the 1940s the work was finally completed. \nIn the transept is the tomb of [[Isabella of Aragon, Queen of France|Isabella of Aragon]], wife of king  [[Philip III of France]]. A long aisle links the Duomo to the archbishops' palace, the ''Palazzo Arcivescovile'', which houses an ''Immacolata'' by [[Luca Giordano]]. One can also admire the rare and precious ''Stauroteca'', a gift from [[Emperor Frederick II]] to the Duomo upon consecration. The work was produced in the royal goldsmiths' workshops, better known as \u201cTiraz\u201d, in a cultural environment which blended Arabic, Byzantine and Western cultural elements.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, the Cathedral of Cosenza received the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site for being \"Heritage Witness to a Culture of Peace\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youritaly.com/Guide_Turistiche/CITIES_OF_ART/Cosenza_City|title=Youritaly.it - Portal for tourism and recreation in Italy|author=|date=|website=Youritaly.it|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062738/http://www.youritaly.com/Guide_Turistiche/CITIES_OF_ART/Cosenza_City|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.italy-holiday.com/calabria/Cosenza|title=Cosenza - Calabria: Your holiday in Italy|author=|date=|website=en.italy-holiday.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\nThis is the first award given by UNESCO to the region of Calabria.\n\n===''Monastero delle Vergini''===\n\nIn via Gaetano Argento stands the \"Convent of the Virgins\". The external part of the main entrance is made of decorated tuff, while the internal part is carved of wood. The convent contains a 16th-century painting of the ''Annunciation''. In front of it, is the 13th-century ''Madonna del Pilerio'' attributed to [[Giovanni da Taranto]], while on the walls are four other anonymous 16th-century paintings: the ''Visitation'', the ''Circumcision'', the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' and the ''Adoration of the Magi''. In the apse is the altarpiece ''Transit of the Virgin'' (1570). The [[cymatium]] houses a painting portraying the ''Coronation of the Virgin'', while at the base of the two columns are paintings, attributed to Michele Curia, the \"Master of Montecalvario\", of two unidentified saints. The wooden choir dates to the 17th century.\n\n===''Giostra Vecchia''===\nIn the fifteenth century, at Palazzo Falvo the [[Renaissance]] was introduced at Cosenza, in the ''Giostra Vecchia''.  Here are located the church and monastery of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. The [[Latin cross]] plan has a nave and two aisles. In the nave stands the impressive high wooden altar built in 1700. Above it is a painting by Daniele Russo representing the ''Perdono d\u2019Assisi ''(1618). The left aisle is home to a wooden 17th-century crucifix, the altar of the ''Madonna della Febbre'' and the statue of the ''Madonna with Child'', in marble, dating to the 16th century. The sacristy has a painted wooden ceiling, a wooden ''armadio'' representing episodes from the Passion of Christ and pictures of saints and Franciscan friars. The stone arch is characterized by the painting of [[St. Francis of Paola]], while on the walls are some frescoes dating to the beginning of the 15th century.\n\n===Hohenstaufen Castle===\n[[File:Hohenstaufen Castle (small).jpg|thumb|left|Hohenstaufen Castle]]\n[[File:Palazzo Arnone.jpg|thumb|Palazzo Arnone, National Gallery]]\n[[File:Bilotti.jpg|thumb|Open Air Museum]]\n[[File:Bagnante1 jpg.jpg|thumb|''The Bather'', by Emilio Greco]]\n\nThe ''Castello Svevo'' (\"Swabian\" or [[Hohenstaufen]] Castle) was originally built by the Saracens on the ruins of the ancient Rocca Brutia, around the year 1000. The castle was restored by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], adding the octagonal tower to the original structure, in 1239. According to tradition, his son [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry]] lived in this castle, as a prisoner at his father's command. [[Louis III of Naples]] and Margaret of Savoy married in the castle and they both settled there in 1432.\n\nAll signs of the ancient Saracen structure have now disappeared. In the internal cloister, the modifications made by the [[Bourbons]] in order to convert it into a prison can also be seen. The entrance-hall is covered by ogival arches with engraved brackets. A wide corridor is dominated by some [[fleur-de-lis]] from the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]]  [[coat of arms]]. They are engraved on the ribbed Hohenstaufen arches.\n\n===''Spirito Santo''===\nThe church of ''Sant'Agostino'', also known as the ''Spirito Santo'', was built in 1507 by the [[Augustinians]]. The original portal has several inscriptions in Gothic characters. The interior has a series of paintings from the eighteenth century. Further on a narrow street leads to the so-called \u201cArea of the [[Bandiera Brothers]]\u201d, the ''Vallone di Rovito''. Here, the insurrectional patriots of 1844 were executed by a firing squad.\n\n===''San Francesco di Paola''===\nIn the Arenella, are the Church and Monastery of [[Saint Francis of Paola]] (1510). The interior, with a single nave, houses the tomb of Ottavio Cesare Gaeta. On the right wall, are two 18th-century paintings: a ''Sacra Famiglia'' and ''Madonna con San Francesco e Sant\u2019Agostino''. On an altar is a wooden statue of Saint Francis of Paola; while on the left side of the nave, on another altar, is a wooden statue of San Michele Arcangelo. The ''Madonna with Child in Glory and Saints Paul and Luke'' (1551) was painted by [[Pietro Negroni]]. In the apse, a 16th-century triptych made by Cristoforo Faffeo represents the ''Madonna and Child in glory with saints Catherine and Sebastian''. At the back of the altar is a wooden choir built in 1679 by M. Domenico Costanzo da Rogliano. On the wall of the sacristy are remains of frescoes dating back to 1550-1600. On the vault are some pastels<!--probably faded frescoes?--> representing scenes from the life of the Saint from Paola.\n\n===''San Salvatore''===\nThe small church of San Salvatore serves the parish which professes the Byzantine-Albanian faith. Inside the nave are a wooden ceiling, some frescoes of the Apostoli, of the Salvatore and of the Madonna, as well as a splendid [[iconostasis]].\n\n===Open Air Museum===\n\nIn the modern part of Cosenza, in an area stretching from the pedestrianized Corso Mazzini to Piazza Bilotti, lies the open-air \"Museo MAB\" (''Museo all'aperto Bilotti'').

English commentators for the event were [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], [[Jerry Lawler]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]]. Spanish, German, French, and Italian commentators also called the matches at ringside. [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Brandi Rhodes|Eden Stiles]] served as the ring announcers.\n\n=== Celebrities ===\n{{see also|List of celebrities involved with WrestleMania}}\nAs is tradition, WrestleMania featured numerous appearances by celebrity guests \u2013 such as ''[[E! News]]'' host [[Maria Menounos]], who served as a backstage interviewer. The pay-per-view broadcast was opened by [[Aloe Blacc]] performing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\". The event saw another musical performance as [[Skylar Grey]], [[Travis Barker]], and [[Kid Ink]] performed a medley of the two WrestleMania 31 theme songs \u2013 \"Rise\" and \"[[Money and the Power]]\". [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also was featured at the event, first as part of the ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' themed grand entrance of [[Triple H]], and later being recognized as part of the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class as a celebrity wing inductee.\n\n=== Pre-show ===\nTwo matches were contested on the WrestleMania Kickoff pre-show. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-Way]] [[tag team]] match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] between the champions [[Tyson Kidd and Cesaro]] (with [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natalya]]), [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Big E Langston|Big E]]) (with [[Xavier Woods]]), [[Primo & Epico|Los Matadores]] ([[Primo (wrestler)|Diego]] and [[Epico|Fernando]]) (with [[Mascarita Dorada|El Torito]]), and [[The Usos]] (Jey and Jimmy Uso) (with [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]]). Kidd and Cesaro retained their titles after Big E suffered a Samoan splash from Jimmy Uso, followed by Cesaro throwing Uso out of the ring and scoring the pin. Also of note, Jey Uso would suffer a shoulder injury during the match, putting him out of action for several months.\n\nThe second pre-show match was the second annual [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant#Legacy|Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]]. [[Big Show]] won the 30-man contest by last eliminating [[Damien Sandow|Damien Mizdow]] after Mizdow had turned on and eliminated his tag team partner [[The Miz]].\n\n=== Preliminary matches ===\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the seven-man [[ladder match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] where champion [[Wade Barrett|Bad News Barrett]] defended the title against [[Daniel Bryan]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], [[Dean Ambrose]], [[Luke Harper]], [[Dolph Ziggler]], and [[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]]. Bryan won the match after he and Ziggler exchanged headbutts at the top of the ladder, causing Ziggler to fall backward and allowing Bryan to claim his first Intercontinental Championship.\n\nNext, [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Randy Orton]]. During the match, both men kicked out of their finishers. Orton eventually won the match after a second \"RKO\", which was given additional elevation as Orton countered Rollins' \"Curb Stomp\" by propelling Rollins up into the air.\n\n[[File:NWo WM31.jpg|thumb|left|[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] members [[Kevin Nash]] (left), [[Hulk Hogan]] (center) and [[Scott Hall]] (right) making their way to the ring]]\nAfter that, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Triple H]] competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|No Disqualification Match]]. This was Sting's first official match in WWE. Midway through the match, Sting locked Triple H in his [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Death Lock]] submission hold, which prompted Triple H's [[D-Generation X]] (DX) allies to enter the ring and attempt to interfere in the match. Sting knocked down [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], countered Triple H's [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] and threw him to the outside, and then launched himself from the top rope onto all four men. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Sting for a near-fall and retrieved a [[sledgehammer]] from under the ring, which prompted the three original [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) members ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) to interfere on Sting's behalf. The nWo members took out DX and Sting dropped Triple H with his [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] for a near-fall. Sting then locked Triple H in another Scorpion Death Lock. Triple H tried to grab his sledgehammer, but Hogan pulled it out of his reach, causing another brawl between both factions while Triple H was still locked in Sting's submission hold. [[Shawn Michaels]] then appeared and executed [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Sting. Triple H went to pin Sting only for Sting to kick out. Triple H grabbed his sledgehammer from Gunn, while Hall tossed a [[Baseball Bat]] to Sting. A standoff ensued between Triple H and Sting as they both held weapons. Sting struck Triple H in the gut with his bat and struck Triple H's sledgehammer which snapped in half. Sting then trapped Triple H in the corner and landed his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stinger splash|Stinger Splash]]. When Sting went for another Stinger Splash, however, Triple H struck Sting with the sledgehammer to win the match. After the match, Triple H and Sting shook hands in the ring while the commentary team speculated that the [[Monday Night Wars|rivalry between WWE and WCW]] had finally been put to rest.\n\nDaniel Bryan was then interviewed backstage by [[Maria Menounos]] regarding his Intercontinental Championship victory, and was joined in celebration by former Intercontinental Champions [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bret Hart]], who all congratulated Bryan by performing Bryan's \"Yes!\" chant together until [[Ron Simmons]] broke up the celebration with his Damn! catchphrase.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[The Bella Twins]] (Brie Bella and [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Champion]] Nikki Bella) faced [[AJ Lee]] and [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Paige and Nikki began the bout. Most of the match saw The Bellas isolating Paige and preventing her from tagging in Lee \u2013 who the Bellas would frequently knock off the ring apron onto the floor \u2013 until Paige landed a somersault plancha to both Bellas on the outside. Paige finally tagged in Lee, who applied her \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Octopus hold|Black Widow]]\" hold to Nikki, but Brie saved her sister from defeat. Paige then ran in with a big boot on Brie but was soon pushed outside the ring. Brie tripped Lee as she ran off the ropes, allowing Nikki to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Forearm smash|Forearm Smash]] on her for a near-fall. In the climax, Paige slammed Brie into the ring steps, allowing Lee to apply the \"Black Widow\" on Nikki, who submitted.\n\nAfter the match, the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] class was introduced; [[The Bushwhackers]], [[Larry Zbysko]], [[Madusa|Alundra Blayze]], [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Kevin Nash]] were presented to the crowd, while posthumous inductees [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Connor Michalek|Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek]] were represented by family members.\n\n[[File:Rock Rousey WM31.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (left) celebrating with [[Ronda Rousey]] (right) after clashing with [[Stephanie McMahon]] and [[Triple H]]]]\nAfter that [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] (accompanied by his manager [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]]) defended his title against [[John Cena]]. Rusev dominated the majority of the match and overpowered Cena throughout, but Cena was able to make a comeback. The end of the match came when Lana climbed onto the ring apron and was accidentally knocked off by Rusev, who then suffered an \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|Attitude Adjustment]]\" for Cena's pin and the title. This was Rusev's first pinfall loss in WWE since he debuted in the main roster in April 2014.\n\nIn the next segment, [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] (Triple H and [[Stephanie McMahon]]) announced that WrestleMania had set a new Levi's Stadium attendance record of 76,976 and began to gloat about their accomplishments and Triple H's victory over Sting earlier in the night, which prompted [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to enter the ring. After a verbal exchange, McMahon insulted the Rock and slapped him across the face, taunting that he wouldn't retaliate because he dare not hit a woman. Rock then brought [[UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship|UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion]] [[Ronda Rousey]] (who sat up front) into the ring. After Rousey told McMahon that she \"owns every ring she's in\" Rock attacked Triple H and Rousey then threw both McMahon and Triple H from the ring, first teasing an armbar on McMahon.\n\nIn the penultimate match, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. This was Undertaker's first appearance since [[WrestleMania XXX]]. It was reported that Wyatt [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] injured his ankle earlier in the day while preparing for the match, resulting in both men working at a slow pace. While Wyatt largely controlled the offense, Undertaker was able to execute most of his signature moves such as \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Arm twist ropewalk chop|Old School]]\", the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]], and \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Snake Eyes|Snake Eyes]]\". Late in the match, Wyatt kicked out of a \"[[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]\", while Undertaker kicked out of \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\". In the end, Undertaker executed a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to win the match.\n\n=== Main event ===\n[[File:Seth Rollins WWE World Heavyweight Championship WrestleMania 31 2015.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=|[[Seth Rollins]] cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to walk out of WrestleMania 31 as  [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]]]]\nIn the main event, [[Brock Lesnar]] defended the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]]  against [[Roman Reigns]]. Within the first minute, Lesnar performed a [[German suplex]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]] on Reigns,  Lesnar also suffered a minor cut to his face (and later on his chin), but went on to dominate the next ten minutes with knee strikes and various suplexes (fisherman, German, overhead belly-to-belly, vertical, snap), leading to Lesnar quipping, \"Suplex City, bitch!\" Lesnar performed a second F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. Lesnar then removed his [[MMA gloves]], slapped Reigns and performed a German suplex and then third F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. A turning point came around the 12-minute mark when the duo was outside the ring; Reigns shoved Lesnar into the ring post, causing Lesnar to bleed profusely from the head. After Lesnar barely avoided being counted out, Reigns performed three [[Superman punch]]es and two consecutive [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spears]], on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar countered another Superman punch with a fourth F-5 on Reigns but failed to follow up with a cover.\n\nWhile both men still were down, Seth Rollins ran down to the ring with his [[Money in the Bank (2014)|Money in the Bank briefcase]] and cashed in his contract, making the singles match a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] and the first time in history a Money In The Bank contract was cashed in during a match. Rollins kicked Reigns out of the ring and performed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar. Rollins went for a second Curb Stomp to Lesnar, who countered by lifting Rollins in preparation for an F-5, but Reigns performed a spear on Lesnar, which saved Rollins. As Lesnar rolled out of the ring, Rollins capitalized with a Curb Stomp to Reigns to win the title. Post-match, Rollins ran back up the entrance ramp and celebrated with the world championship title.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-wwe-wrestlemania-31-review-3-29-15/ Csonka's Wrestlemania 31 Review \u2013 411 Mania.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/general/eye-on-sports/25128925/wwe-wrestlemania-31-roundtable-review-recapping-sundays-show Wrestlemania 31 results \u2013 CBS Sports.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?41564 Powell's WrestleMania 31 results and review]</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWWE claimed that the show was the highest-grossing WWE event ever at the time, drawing revenue of $12.6 million.

English commentators for the event were [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], [[Jerry Lawler]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]]. Spanish, German, French, and Italian commentators also called the matches at ringside. [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Brandi Rhodes|Eden Stiles]] served as the ring announcers.\n\n=== Celebrities ===\n{{see also|List of celebrities involved with WrestleMania}}\nAs is tradition, WrestleMania featured numerous appearances by celebrity guests \u2013 such as ''[[E! News]]'' host [[Maria Menounos]], who served as a backstage interviewer. The pay-per-view broadcast was opened by [[Aloe Blacc]] performing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\". The event saw another musical performance as [[Skylar Grey]], [[Travis Barker]], and [[Kid Ink]] performed a medley of the two WrestleMania 31 theme songs \u2013 \"Rise\" and \"[[Money and the Power]]\". [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also was featured at the event, first as part of the ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' themed grand entrance of [[Triple H]], and later being recognized as part of the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class as a celebrity wing inductee.\n\n=== Pre-show ===\nTwo matches were contested on the WrestleMania Kickoff pre-show. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-Way]] [[tag team]] match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] between the champions [[Tyson Kidd and Cesaro]] (with [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natalya]]), [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Big E Langston|Big E]]) (with [[Xavier Woods]]), [[Primo & Epico|Los Matadores]] ([[Primo (wrestler)|Diego]] and [[Epico|Fernando]]) (with [[Mascarita Dorada|El Torito]]), and [[The Usos]] (Jey and Jimmy Uso) (with [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]]). Kidd and Cesaro retained their titles after Big E suffered a Samoan splash from Jimmy Uso, followed by Cesaro throwing Uso out of the ring and scoring the pin. Also of note, Jey Uso would suffer a shoulder injury during the match, putting him out of action for several months.\n\nThe second pre-show match was the second annual [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant#Legacy|Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]]. [[Big Show]] won the 30-man contest by last eliminating [[Damien Sandow|Damien Mizdow]] after Mizdow had turned on and eliminated his tag team partner [[The Miz]].\n\n=== Preliminary matches ===\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the seven-man [[ladder match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] where champion [[Wade Barrett|Bad News Barrett]] defended the title against [[Daniel Bryan]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], [[Dean Ambrose]], [[Luke Harper]], [[Dolph Ziggler]], and [[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]]. Bryan won the match after he and Ziggler exchanged headbutts at the top of the ladder, causing Ziggler to fall backward and allowing Bryan to claim his first Intercontinental Championship.\n\nNext, [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Randy Orton]]. During the match, both men kicked out of their finishers. Orton eventually won the match after a second \"RKO\", which was given additional elevation as Orton countered Rollins' \"Curb Stomp\" by propelling Rollins up into the air.\n\n[[File:NWo WM31.jpg|thumb|left|[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] members [[Kevin Nash]] (left), [[Hulk Hogan]] (center) and [[Scott Hall]] (right) making their way to the ring]]\nAfter that, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Triple H]] competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|No Disqualification Match]]. This was Sting's first official match in WWE. Midway through the match, Sting locked Triple H in his [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Death Lock]] submission hold, which prompted Triple H's [[D-Generation X]] (DX) allies to enter the ring and attempt to interfere in the match. Sting knocked down [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], countered Triple H's [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] and threw him to the outside, and then launched himself from the top rope onto all four men. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Sting for a near-fall and retrieved a [[sledgehammer]] from under the ring, which prompted the three original [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) members ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) to interfere on Sting's behalf. The nWo members took out DX and Sting dropped Triple H with his [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] for a near-fall. Sting then locked Triple H in another Scorpion Death Lock. Triple H tried to grab his sledgehammer, but Hogan pulled it out of his reach, causing another brawl between both factions while Triple H was still locked in Sting's submission hold. [[Shawn Michaels]] then appeared and executed [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Sting. Triple H went to pin Sting only for Sting to kick out. Triple H grabbed his sledgehammer from Gunn, while Hall tossed a [[Baseball Bat]] to Sting. A standoff ensued between Triple H and Sting as they both held weapons. Sting struck Triple H in the gut with his bat and struck Triple H's sledgehammer which snapped in half. Sting then trapped Triple H in the corner and landed his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stinger splash|Stinger Splash]]. When Sting went for another Stinger Splash, however, Triple H struck Sting with the sledgehammer to win the match. After the match, Triple H and Sting shook hands in the ring while the commentary team speculated that the [[Monday Night Wars|rivalry between WWE and WCW]] had finally been put to rest.\n\nDaniel Bryan was then interviewed backstage by [[Maria Menounos]] regarding his Intercontinental Championship victory, and was joined in celebration by former Intercontinental Champions [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bret Hart]], who all congratulated Bryan by performing Bryan's \"Yes!\" chant together until [[Ron Simmons]] broke up the celebration with his Damn! catchphrase.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[The Bella Twins]] (Brie Bella and [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Champion]] Nikki Bella) faced [[AJ Lee]] and [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Paige and Nikki began the bout. Most of the match saw The Bellas isolating Paige and preventing her from tagging in Lee \u2013 who the Bellas would frequently knock off the ring apron onto the floor \u2013 until Paige landed a somersault plancha to both Bellas on the outside. Paige finally tagged in Lee, who applied her \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Octopus hold|Black Widow]]\" hold to Nikki, but Brie saved her sister from defeat. Paige then ran in with a big boot on Brie but was soon pushed outside the ring. Brie tripped Lee as she ran off the ropes, allowing Nikki to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Forearm smash|Forearm Smash]] on her for a near-fall. In the climax, Paige slammed Brie into the ring steps, allowing Lee to apply the \"Black Widow\" on Nikki, who submitted.\n\nAfter the match, the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] class was introduced; [[The Bushwhackers]], [[Larry Zbysko]], [[Madusa|Alundra Blayze]], [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Kevin Nash]] were presented to the crowd, while posthumous inductees [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Connor Michalek|Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek]] were represented by family members.\n\n[[File:Rock Rousey WM31.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (left) celebrating with [[Ronda Rousey]] (right) after clashing with [[Stephanie McMahon]] and [[Triple H]]]]\nAfter that [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] (accompanied by his manager [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]]) defended his title against [[John Cena]]. Rusev dominated the majority of the match and overpowered Cena throughout, but Cena was able to make a comeback. The end of the match came when Lana climbed onto the ring apron and was accidentally knocked off by Rusev, who then suffered an \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|Attitude Adjustment]]\" for Cena's pin and the title. This was Rusev's first pinfall loss in WWE since he debuted in the main roster in April 2014.\n\nIn the next segment, [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] (Triple H and [[Stephanie McMahon]]) announced that WrestleMania had set a new Levi's Stadium attendance record of 76,976 and began to gloat about their accomplishments and Triple H's victory over Sting earlier in the night, which prompted [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to enter the ring. After a verbal exchange, McMahon insulted the Rock and slapped him across the face, taunting that he wouldn't retaliate because he dare not hit a woman. Rock then brought [[UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship|UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion]] [[Ronda Rousey]] (who sat up front) into the ring. After Rousey told McMahon that she \"owns every ring she's in\" Rock attacked Triple H and Rousey then threw both McMahon and Triple H from the ring, first teasing an armbar on McMahon.\n\nIn the penultimate match, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. This was Undertaker's first appearance since [[WrestleMania XXX]]. It was reported that Wyatt [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] injured his ankle earlier in the day while preparing for the match, resulting in both men working at a slow pace. While Wyatt largely controlled the offense, Undertaker was able to execute most of his signature moves such as \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Arm twist ropewalk chop|Old School]]\", the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]], and \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Snake Eyes|Snake Eyes]]\". Late in the match, Wyatt kicked out of a \"[[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]\", while Undertaker kicked out of \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\". In the end, Undertaker executed a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to win the match.\n\n=== Main event ===\n[[File:Seth Rollins WWE World Heavyweight Championship WrestleMania 31 2015.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=|[[Seth Rollins]] cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to walk out of WrestleMania 31 as  [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]]]]\nIn the main event, [[Brock Lesnar]] defended the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]]  against [[Roman Reigns]]. Within the first minute, Lesnar performed a [[German suplex]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]] on Reigns,  Lesnar also suffered a minor cut to his face (and later on his chin), but went on to dominate the next ten minutes with knee strikes and various suplexes (fisherman, German, overhead belly-to-belly, vertical, snap), leading to Lesnar quipping, \"Suplex City, bitch!\" Lesnar performed a second F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. Lesnar then removed his [[MMA gloves]], slapped Reigns and performed a German suplex and then third F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. A turning point came around the 12-minute mark when the duo was outside the ring; Reigns shoved Lesnar into the ring post, causing Lesnar to bleed profusely from the head. After Lesnar barely avoided being counted out, Reigns performed three [[Superman punch]]es and two consecutive [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spears]], on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar countered another Superman punch with a fourth F-5 on Reigns but failed to follow up with a cover.\n\nWhile both men still were down, Seth Rollins ran down to the ring with his [[Money in the Bank (2014)|Money in the Bank briefcase]] and cashed in his contract, making the singles match a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] and the first time in history a Money In The Bank contract was cashed in during a match. Rollins kicked Reigns out of the ring and performed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar. Rollins went for a second Curb Stomp to Lesnar, who countered by lifting Rollins in preparation for an F-5, but Reigns performed a spear on Lesnar, which saved Rollins. As Lesnar rolled out of the ring, Rollins capitalized with a Curb Stomp to Reigns to win the title. Post-match, Rollins ran back up the entrance ramp and celebrated with the world championship title.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-wwe-wrestlemania-31-review-3-29-15/ Csonka's Wrestlemania 31 Review \u2013 411 Mania.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/general/eye-on-sports/25128925/wwe-wrestlemania-31-roundtable-review-recapping-sundays-show Wrestlemania 31 results \u2013 CBS Sports.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?41564 Powell's WrestleMania 31 results and review]</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWWE claimed that the show was the highest-grossing WWE event ever at the time, drawing revenue of $12.6 million.

Lesnar responded by attacking Rollins, who escaped. Lesnar then attacked Rollins' cornermen J&J Security ([[Jamie Noble]] and [[Joey Mercury]]), a cameraman, and the broadcast announcers ([[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]], and [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]). As a result, Lesnar was fired and fined by [[Stephanie McMahon]] in storyline. [[Byron Saxton]] and [[Jerry Lawler]] immediately replaced them in the broken announce table. [[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] also replaced Michael Cole as lead announcer for two weeks on the following Thursday on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''. Rollins returned later during the show where [[Randy Orton]] declared a title shot request due to beating Rollins the night before. Orton and Rollins then had a steel cage match for the title at [[Extreme Rules (2015)|Extreme Rules]], where Rollins retained after interference from [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. Due to Rollins not winning cleanly, a fatal four-way match was scheduled for [[Payback (2015)|Payback]] where [[Roman Reigns]], [[Dean Ambrose]] and Orton went for the title. Ambrose and Reigns were given title shots after beating Rollins on consecutive ''Raw'' shows. Rollins then defended the title against Ambrose at [[Elimination Chamber (2015)|Elimination Chamber]] due to Ambrose stealing the title two weeks before the event. Rollins again retained at [[Money in the Bank (2015)|Money in the Bank]] after being demanded by The Authority to win without any form of assistance.
