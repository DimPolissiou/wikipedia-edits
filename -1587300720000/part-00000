In the beginning, TIFF was only a [[binary image]] format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate [[grayscale]] images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], is a popular format for [[Deep color|deep-color]] images.\n\nThe first version of the TIFF specification was published by [[Aldus|Aldus Corporation]] in the autumn of 1986 after two major earlier draft releases. It can be labeled as Revision 3.0. It was published after a series of meetings with various scanner manufacturers and software developers. In April 1987 Revision 4.0 was released and it contained mostly minor enhancements. In October 1988 Revision 5.0 was released and it added support for palette color images and [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW compression]].<ref name=\"tiff6\">[https://www.adobe.io/content/udp/en/open/standards/TIFF/_jcr_content/contentbody/download/file.res/TIFF6.pdf TIFF Revision 6.0 Final \u2014 June 3, 1992], Retrieved on 2009-07-10</ref>\n\n== Features and options ==\nTIFF is a flexible, adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied [[image compression]]) defining the image's geometry. A TIFF file, for example, can be a container holding [[JPEG]] (lossy) and [[PackBits]] (lossless) compressed images. A TIFF file also can include a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]-based [[clipping path]] (outlines, croppings, image frames). The ability to store image data in a [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] format makes a TIFF file a useful image archive, because, unlike standard JPEG files, a TIFF file using lossless compression (or none) may be edited and re-saved without losing image quality. This is not the case when using the TIFF as a container holding compressed JPEG. Other TIFF options are [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] and pages.\n\nTIFF offers the option of using [[Lempel-Ziv-Welch|LZW]] compression, a lossless data-compression technique for reducing a file's size. Use of this option was limited by patents on the LZW technique until their expiration in 2004.\n\nThe TIFF 6.0 specification consists of the following parts:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n* Introduction (contains information about TIFF Administration, usage of Private fields and values, etc.)\n* Part 1: Baseline TIFF\n* Part 2: TIFF Extensions\n* Part 3: Appendices\n\n=== {{anchor|Baseline TIFF}}Part 1: Baseline TIFF ===\nWhen TIFF was introduced, its extensibility provoked compatibility problems. The flexibility in encoding gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for ''Thousands of Incompatible File Formats''.<ref name=\"trauth\">{{cite book\n|title=MATLAB Recipes For Earth Sciences\n|last=Trauth\n|first=Martin H.\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=2006\n|ISBN=3-540-27983-0\n|page=198\n}}</ref> To avoid these problems, every TIFF reader was required to read ''Baseline TIFF''. Among other things, Baseline TIFF does not include layers, or compressed JPEG or LZW images. Baseline TIFF is formally known as ''TIFF 6.0, Part 1: Baseline TIFF''.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of required Baseline TIFF features:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Multiple subfiles ====\nTIFF readers must be prepared for multiple/multi-page images (subfiles) per TIFF file, although they are not required to actually do anything with images after the first one.\n\nThere may be more than one Image File Directory (IFD) in a TIFF file. Each IFD defines a subfile. One use of subfiles is to describe related images, such as the pages of a facsimile document. A Baseline TIFF reader is not required to read any IFD beyond the first one.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Strips ====\nA baseline TIFF image is composed of one or more strips. A strip (or band) is a subsection of the image composed of one or more rows. Each strip may be compressed independently of the entire image, and each begins on a byte boundary. If the image height is not evenly divisible by the number of rows in the strip, the last strip may contain fewer rows. If strip definition tags are omitted, the image is assumed to contain a single strip.\n\n==== Compression ====\nBaseline TIFF readers must handle the following three compression schemes:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n* No compression\n* [[ITU-T|CCITT]] Group 3 1-Dimensional Modified [[Huffman coding|Huffman]] RLE\n* [[PackBits]] compression - a form of [[run-length encoding]]\n\n==== Image types ====\nBaseline TIFF image types are: bilevel, grayscale, palette-color, and RGB full-color images.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Byte order ====\nEvery TIFF file begins with a two-[[byte]] indicator of [[byte order]]: \"<code>II</code>\" for little-endian (a.k.a. \"Intel byte ordering\", circa 1980)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">David Beecher, author of dozens of image processing engines over the last 30 years. Any TIFF file can be viewed with a HEX editor to confirm this.</ref> or \"<code>MM</code>\" for big-endian (a.k.a. \"Motorola byte ordering\", circa 1980)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> byte ordering. The next two-byte word contains the format version number, which has always been 42 for every version of TIFF (e.g., TIFF v5.0 and TIFF v6.0).<ref>{{cite book\n |     author = Aldus/Microsoft\n |      title = TIFF\n |    section = 1) Structure\n |    version = Revision 5.0\n |  publisher = Aldus Corporation and Microsoft Corporation\n |       date = 1988-08-08\n |        url = http://cool-palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204070129/http://cool-palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-04\n | accessdate = 2009-06-29\n |      quote = The number 42 was chosen for its deep philosophical significance.\n }}</ref>\nAll words, double words, etc., in the TIFF file are assumed to be in the indicated byte order. The TIFF 6.0 specification states that compliant TIFF readers must support both byte orders (<code>II</code> and <code>MM</code>); writers may use either.<ref>{{cite book\n |author      = Adobe Developers Association\n |title       = TIFF\n |section     = Section 7: Additional baseline TIFF Requirements\n |version     = Revision 6.0\n |publisher   = Adobe Systems Incorporated\n |date        = 1992-06-03\n |url         = https://www.adobe.io/content/dam/udp/en/open/standards/tiff/TIFF6.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |accessdate  = 2018-12-25\n |quote       = \u2018MM\u2019 and \u2018II\u2019 byte order.

TIFF writers can do whichever is most convenient or efficient.\n |page        = 26\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n==== Other TIFF fields ====\nTIFF readers must be prepared to encounter and ignore private fields not described in the TIFF specification. TIFF readers must not refuse to read a TIFF file if some optional fields do not exist.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n=== {{anchor|TIFF Extensions}}Part 2: TIFF Extensions ===\nMany TIFF readers support tags additional to those in Baseline TIFF, but not every reader supports every extension.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319196/en-us |title=You cannot preview scanned TIFF file in Windows Picture and Fax Viewer |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref name=\"wfax-packbits\">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329270 |title=You Cannot View TIFF Images Using Windows Picture and Fax Viewer |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://suppressingfire.org/~burner/evil-mods-tiff/ |title=Handling Microsoft Office Document Scanning TNEF and TIFFs in Linux |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430204808/http://suppressingfire.org/~burner/evil-mods-tiff/ |archivedate=2013-04-30 }}</ref><ref name=\"tiff-msimaging\">{{cite web |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/about-tagged-image-file-format-tiff-HP003081257.aspx |title=About Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) |accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref> As a consequence, Baseline TIFF features became the lowest common denominator for TIFF. Baseline TIFF features are extended in TIFF Extensions (defined in the TIFF 6.0 Part 2 specification) but extensions can also be defined in private tags.\n\nThe TIFF Extensions are formally known as ''TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions''. Here are some examples of TIFF extensions defined in TIFF 6.0 specification:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n====Compression====\n* CCITT T.4 bi-level encoding\n* CCITT T.6 bi-level encoding\n* LZW Compression scheme\n* JPEG-based compression (TIFF compression scheme 7) uses the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) introduced in 1974 by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao; see Reference 1 in [[Discrete cosine transform]]. For more details see [https://www.adobe.io/content/dam/udp/en/open/standards/tiff/TIFFphotoshop.pdf Adobe document].\n\n====Image types====\n* [[CMYK]] Images\n* [[YCbCr]] Images\n* HalftoneHints\n* Tiled Images\n* [[CIE Lab|CIE L*a*b*]] Images\n\n====Image trees====\nA baseline TIFF file can contain a sequence of images (IFD). Typically, all the images are related but represent different data, such as the pages of a document. In order to explicitly support multiple views of the ''same'' data, the ''SubIFD'' tag was introduced.<ref>[https://www.adobe.io/content/udp/en/open/standards/TIFF/_jcr_content/contentbody/download_1704706507/file.res/TIFFPM6.pdf TIFF Specification Supplement 1], Retrieved 2013-08-04</ref> This allows the images to be defined along a [[tree structure]]. Each image can have a sequence of children, each child being itself an image. The typical usage is to provide thumbnails or several versions of an image in different color spaces.\n\n=====Tiles=====\nA TIFF image may also be composed of a number of tiles. All tiles in the same image have the same dimensions and may be compressed independently of the entire image, similar to strips (see above). Tiled images are part of TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions, so the support for tiled images is not required in Baseline TIFF readers.\n\n====Other extensions====\nAccording to TIFF 6.0 specification (Introduction), all TIFF files using proposed TIFF extensions that are not approved by Adobe as part of Baseline TIFF (typically for specialized uses of TIFF that do not fall within the domain of publishing or general graphics or picture interchange) should be either not called TIFF files or should be marked some way so that they will not be confused with mainstream TIFF files.\n\n==== Private tags ====\nDevelopers can apply for a block of \"private tags\" to enable them to include their own proprietary information inside a TIFF file without causing problems for file interchange. TIFF readers are required to ignore tags that they do not recognize, and a registered developer's private tags are guaranteed not to clash with anyone else's tags or with the standard set of tags defined in the specification. Private tags are numbered in the range 32,768 and higher.\n\nPrivate tags are reserved for information meaningful only for some organization, or for experiments with a new compression scheme within TIFF. Upon request, the TIFF administrator (currently Adobe) will allocate and register one or more private tags for an organization, to avoid possible conflicts with other organizations. Organizations and developers are discouraged from choosing their own tag numbers arbitrarily, because doing so could cause serious compatibility problems. However, if there is little or no chance that TIFF files will escape a private environment, organizations and developers are encouraged to consider using TIFF tags in the \"reusable\" 65,000\u201365,535 range. There is no need to contact Adobe when using numbers in this range.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n=== Internet Media Type ===\nThe MIME type ''image/tiff'' (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The optional \"application\" parameter (Example: Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo) is defined for image/tiff to identify a particular subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions used in the application parameter must be published as an RFC.<ref name=\"jdf\" />\n\n[[MIME]] type ''image/tiff-fx'' (defined in RFC 3949 and RFC 3950) is based on TIFF 6.0 with TIFF Technical Notes TTN1 (Trees) and TTN2 (Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification). It is used for [[Internet fax]] compatible with the ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white, grayscale and color [[fax]].\n\n===TIFF Compression Tag===\nThe TIFF Tag 259 (0103<sub>16</sub>) stores the information about the Compression method. The default value is 1 = no compression.\n\nMost TIFF writers and TIFF readers support only some TIFF compression schemes. Here are some examples of used TIFF compression schemes:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|+ TIFF Compression Tag<ref name=\"wfax-packbits\" /><ref name=\"tiff-msimaging\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/compression.html |title=Baseline TIFF Tag Compression |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libtiff.org/support.html |title=LibTIFF - TIFF 6.0 Specification Coverage |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-tags.html |title=JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment - TIFF Compression Schemes |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130161333/http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-tags.html |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-hul.html |title=JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment - JHOVE TIFF-hul Module |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210133003/http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-hul.html |archivedate=December 10, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tiki-lounge.com/~raf/tiff/tifffields.html |title=TIFF Fields |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/content/tiff_tags.shtml |title=Tags for TIFF and Related Specifications |author=Library of Congress Collections |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-images-out.html#file-tiff-save |title=GIMP Documentation - Saving as TIFF |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irfanview.com/history_old.htm |title=IrfanView - History of changes |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Some implementations even use a signed 32-bit offset, running into issues around 2 GiB. BigTIFF is a TIFF variant file format which uses 64-bit offsets and supports much larger files.<ref>{{cite web |title=Extending LibTiff library with support for the new format called BigTIFF|url=http://simplesystems.org/libtiff/bigtiffpr.html}}</ref> The BigTIFF file format specification was implemented in 2007 in development releases of [[LibTIFF]] version 4.0, which was finally released as stable in December 2011. Support for BigTIFF file formats by applications is limited.\n\n=== Digital preservation ===\nAdobe holds the copyright on the TIFF specification (aka TIFF 6.0) along with the two supplements that have been published.  These documents can be found on the Adobe TIFF Resources page.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.io/open/standards/TIFF.html |title=Adobe TIFF Resources page |accessdate=2018-08-10 |df= }}</ref> The [[Fax]] standard in RFC 3949 is based on these TIFF specifications.<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml|title=TIFF, Revision 6.0|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|work=Digital Preservation|date=2014-01-08|accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\nTIFF files that strictly use the basic \"tag sets\" as defined in TIFF 6.0 along with restricting the compression technology to the methods identified in TIFF 6.0 and are adequately tested and verified by multiple sources for all documents being created can be used for storing documents.   Commonly seen issues encountered in the content and [[document management]] industry associated with the use of TIFF files arise when the structures contain proprietary headers, are not properly documented, and/or contain \"wrappers\" or other containers around the TIFF datasets, and/or include improper compression technologies, or those compression technologies are not properly implemented.\n\nVariants of TIFF can be used within [[document imaging]] and content/document management systems using [[ITU-T|CCITT]] [[Group 4 compression|Group IV 2D compression]] which supports [[black-and-white]] (bitonal, [[monochrome]]) images, among other compression technologies that support [[color]]. When storage capacity and network bandwidth was a greater issue than commonly seen in today's server environments, high-volume storage scanning, documents were scanned in black and white (not in color or in grayscale) to conserve storage capacity.\n\nThe inclusion of the SampleFormat tag in TIFF 6.0 allows TIFF files to handle advanced pixel data types, including integer images with more than 8 bits per channel and floating point images. This tag made TIFF 6.0 a viable format for scientific image processing where extended precision is required. An example would be the use of TIFF to store images acquired using scientific CCD cameras that provide up to 16 bits per photosite of intensity resolution. Storing a sequence of images in a single TIFF file is also possible, and is allowed under TIFF 6.0, provided the rules for multi-page images are followed.\n\n=== TIFF/IT ===\n<!-- Section header linked to from redirects -->\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = TIFF/IT\n| extension = .fp, .ct, .lw, .hc, .mp, .bp, .bl, .sd<ref name=\"jdf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cip4.org/documents/jdf_specifications/html/APPX_MimeType_and_MimeTypeVersion_attributes.html |title=JDF Specification - Appendix H MimeType and MimeTypeVersion Attributes |author=CIP4 |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n| mime = not defined<ref name=\"jdf\" />\n| type code =\n| uniform type =\n| owner = ANSI, ISO\n| released = {{start date|1993}}\n| latest release version = TIFF/IT\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2004|df=yes}}\n| genre = [[Image file formats|Image file format]]\n| container for =\n| contained by =\n| extended from = TIFF 6.0\n| extended to =\n| standard = ISO 12639<ref name=\"TIFF/IT\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?Sku=ISO%2012639:2004&PageType=2 |title=ISO 12639:2004 - Graphic technology - Prepress digital data exchange - Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT) |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"dis12639\">{{citation |url=http://licencepro.estienne.free.fr/Normes/tiffIT_p2.pdf |title=DRAFT INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO/DIS 12639 - Graphic technology \u2014 Prepress digital data exchange \u2014 Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT) - Revision of first edition (ISO 12639:1998) |format=PDF |author=ISO |year=2002 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref>\n}}\nTIFF/IT is used to send data for print-ready pages that have been designed on high-end prepress systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.printingtips.com/glossary-term/t--2360/tiffit.asp |title=Glossary of Printing Terms - TIFF/IT |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> The TIFF/IT specification (ISO 12639) describes a multiple-file format, which can describe a single page per file set.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cip4.org/documents/ppf_specifications/cip3embd_v1_0.pdf |title=CIP3 application note |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> TIFF/IT files are not interchangeable with common TIFF files.<ref name=\"rmg\">{{citation |url=http://www.rgmgraphics.com/Tiff-It.pdf |title=Tiff/It Questions and Answers |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\"issuu\">{{citation |url=http://issuu.com/michaelejahn/docs/jahn_introtopdfx_fontsembed |title=Introduction to PDF/X |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interviewmagspecs.com/Pages/Tiff_It_P1_Specs.html |title=Tiff/It P1 Specifications |quote=Note: TIFF/IT-P1 is not equivalent to a Photoshop\u00ae Tiff! |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n\nThe goals in developing TIFF/IT were to carry forward the original [[IT8]] magnetic-tape formats into a medium-independent version.

Not all valid TIFF/IT images are valid TIFF 6.0 images.<ref name=\"ipa\" />\n\nTIFF/IT defines image-file formats for encoding color continuous-tone picture images, color [[line art]] images, high-resolution continuous-tone images, monochrome continuous-tone images, binary picture images, binary line-art images, screened data, and images of composite final pages.<ref name=\"TIFF/IT2\" />\n\nThere is no MIME type defined for TIFF/IT. The MIME type ''image/tiff'' should not be used for TIFF/IT files, because TIFF/IT does not conform to Baseline TIFF 6.0 and the widely deployed TIFF 6.0 readers cannot read TIFF/IT. The MIME type ''image/tiff'' (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The application parameter should be used with ''image/tiff'' to distinguish TIFF extensions or TIFF subsets. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions must be published as an RFC. There is no such RFC for TIFF/IT. There is also no plan by the ISO committee that oversees TIFF/IT standard to register TIFF/IT with either a parameter to image/tiff or as new separate MIME type.<ref name=\"jdf\" />\n\n==== TIFF/IT files ====\nTIFF/IT consists of a number of different files and it cannot be created or opened by common desktop applications.<ref name=\"jdf\" /><ref name=\"rmg\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddap.org/resource_center/tiffit_implementers.php |title=TIFF/IT Implementers |year=2003 |author=DDAP Association |accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425150213/http://www.ddap.org/resource_center/tiffit_implementers.php |archivedate=April 25, 2005 }}</ref> TIFF/IT-P1 file sets usually consist of the following files:<ref name=\"TIFF/IT2\" /><ref name=\"prepressure-tiffit\" /><ref name=\"xitron\">{{citation|url=http://www.xitron.com/downloads/support/technical_documents/plugin_manuals/tiffitp1out.pdf |title=Harlequin RIP - manual for a commercial TIFF/IT plugin |accessdate=2011-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220205500/http://www.xitron.com/downloads/support/technical_documents/plugin_manuals/tiffitp1out.pdf |archivedate=February 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n* Final Page (FP)\n* Continuous Tone image (CT)\n* Line Work image (LW)\n* High resolution Continuous-tone files (HC - optional)\nTIFF/IT also defines the following files:<ref name=\"TIFF/IT2\" />\n* Monochrome continuous-tone Picture images (MP)\n* Binary Picture images (BP)\n* Binary Line-art images (BL)\n* Screened Data (SD)\n\nSome of these data types are partly compatible with the corresponding definitions in the TIFF 6.0 specification.

Private tags can be used by developers (e.g., Scitex) to preserve specific printing values or other functionality. Private tags are typically labelled with tag numbers greater than or equal to 32768.\n\nAll private tags must be requested from Adobe (the TIFF administrator) and registered.\n\nIn 1992, the DDAP (Digital Distribution of Advertising for Publication, later Digital Directions in Applications for Production) developed their requirement statement for digital ad delivery. This was presented to  ANSI-accredited CGATS (Committee for Graphic Arts Technology Standards) for development of an accredited file format standard for the delivery of digital ads. CGATS reviewed their alternatives for this purpose and TIFF seemed like the ideal candidate, except for the fact that it could not handle certain required functionalities. CGATS asked Aldus (the TIFF administrator) for a block of their own TIFF private tags in order to implement what eventually became TIFF/IT. For example, the ability to identify the sequence of the colors is handled by tag 34017 - the Color Sequence Tag.<ref name=\"tiffitprivatetags\" />\n\nTIFF/IT was created to satisfy the need for a transport-independent method of encoding raster data in the IT8.1,\nIT8.2 and IT8.5 standards.\n\n=== Standards ===\nTIFF/IT was defined in ANSI IT8.8\u20131993 standard in 1993 and later revised in the International Standard ''ISO 12639:1998 - Prepress digital data exchange \u2013 Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT)''.<ref name=\"TIFF/IT\" /> The ISO standard replaces ANSI IT8.8\u20131993.

In the beginning, TIFF was only a [[binary image]] format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate [[grayscale]] images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], is a popular format for [[Deep color|deep-color]] images.\n\nThe first version of the TIFF specification was published by [[Aldus|Aldus Corporation]] in the autumn of 1986 after two major earlier draft releases. It can be labeled as Revision 3.0. It was published after a series of meetings with various scanner manufacturers and software developers. In April 1987 Revision 4.0 was released and it contained mostly minor enhancements. In October 1988 Revision 5.0 was released and it added support for palette color images and [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW compression]].<ref name=\"tiff6\">[https://www.adobe.io/content/udp/en/open/standards/TIFF/_jcr_content/contentbody/download/file.res/TIFF6.pdf TIFF Revision 6.0 Final \u2014 June 3, 1992], Retrieved on 2009-07-10</ref>\n\n== Features and options ==\nTIFF is a flexible, adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied [[image compression]]) defining the image's geometry. A TIFF file, for example, can be a container holding [[JPEG]] (lossy) and [[PackBits]] (lossless) compressed images. A TIFF file also can include a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]-based [[clipping path]] (outlines, croppings, image frames). The ability to store image data in a [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] format makes a TIFF file a useful image archive, because, unlike standard JPEG files, a TIFF file using lossless compression (or none) may be edited and re-saved without losing image quality. This is not the case when using the TIFF as a container holding compressed JPEG. Other TIFF options are [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] and pages.\n\nTIFF offers the option of using [[Lempel-Ziv-Welch|LZW]] compression, a lossless data-compression technique for reducing a file's size. Use of this option was limited by patents on the LZW technique until their expiration in 2004.\n\nThe TIFF 6.0 specification consists of the following parts:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n* Introduction (contains information about TIFF Administration, usage of Private fields and values, etc.)\n* Part 1: Baseline TIFF\n* Part 2: TIFF Extensions\n* Part 3: Appendices\n\n=== {{anchor|Baseline TIFF}}Part 1: Baseline TIFF ===\nWhen TIFF was introduced, its extensibility provoked compatibility problems. The flexibility in encoding gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for ''Thousands of Incompatible File Formats''.<ref name=\"trauth\">{{cite book\n|title=MATLAB Recipes For Earth Sciences\n|last=Trauth\n|first=Martin H.\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=2006\n|ISBN=3-540-27983-0\n|page=198\n}}</ref> To avoid these problems, every TIFF reader was required to read ''Baseline TIFF''. Among other things, Baseline TIFF does not include layers, or compressed JPEG or LZW images. Baseline TIFF is formally known as ''TIFF 6.0, Part 1: Baseline TIFF''.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of required Baseline TIFF features:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Multiple subfiles ====\nTIFF readers must be prepared for multiple/multi-page images (subfiles) per TIFF file, although they are not required to actually do anything with images after the first one.\n\nThere may be more than one Image File Directory (IFD) in a TIFF file. Each IFD defines a subfile. One use of subfiles is to describe related images, such as the pages of a facsimile document. A Baseline TIFF reader is not required to read any IFD beyond the first one.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Strips ====\nA baseline TIFF image is composed of one or more strips. A strip (or band) is a subsection of the image composed of one or more rows. Each strip may be compressed independently of the entire image, and each begins on a byte boundary. If the image height is not evenly divisible by the number of rows in the strip, the last strip may contain fewer rows. If strip definition tags are omitted, the image is assumed to contain a single strip.\n\n==== Compression ====\nBaseline TIFF readers must handle the following three compression schemes:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n* No compression\n* [[ITU-T|CCITT]] Group 3 1-Dimensional Modified [[Huffman coding|Huffman]] RLE\n* [[PackBits]] compression - a form of [[run-length encoding]]\n\n==== Image types ====\nBaseline TIFF image types are: bilevel, grayscale, palette-color, and RGB full-color images.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n==== Byte order ====\nEvery TIFF file begins with a two-[[byte]] indicator of [[byte order]]: \"<code>II</code>\" for little-endian (a.k.a. \"Intel byte ordering\", circa 1980)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">David Beecher, author of dozens of image processing engines over the last 30 years. Any TIFF file can be viewed with a HEX editor to confirm this.</ref> or \"<code>MM</code>\" for big-endian (a.k.a. \"Motorola byte ordering\", circa 1980)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> byte ordering. The next two-byte word contains the format version number, which has always been 42 for every version of TIFF (e.g., TIFF v5.0 and TIFF v6.0).<ref>{{cite book\n |     author = Aldus/Microsoft\n |      title = TIFF\n |    section = 1) Structure\n |    version = Revision 5.0\n |  publisher = Aldus Corporation and Microsoft Corporation\n |       date = 1988-08-08\n |        url = http://cool-palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204070129/http://cool-palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-04\n | accessdate = 2009-06-29\n |      quote = The number 42 was chosen for its deep philosophical significance.\n }}</ref>\nAll words, double words, etc., in the TIFF file are assumed to be in the indicated byte order.

TIFF readers must not refuse to read a TIFF file if some optional fields do not exist.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n=== {{anchor|TIFF Extensions}}Part 2: TIFF Extensions ===\nMany TIFF readers support tags additional to those in Baseline TIFF, but not every reader supports every extension.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319196/en-us |title=You cannot preview scanned TIFF file in Windows Picture and Fax Viewer |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref name=\"wfax-packbits\">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329270 |title=You Cannot View TIFF Images Using Windows Picture and Fax Viewer |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://suppressingfire.org/~burner/evil-mods-tiff/ |title=Handling Microsoft Office Document Scanning TNEF and TIFFs in Linux |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430204808/http://suppressingfire.org/~burner/evil-mods-tiff/ |archivedate=2013-04-30 }}</ref><ref name=\"tiff-msimaging\">{{cite web |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/about-tagged-image-file-format-tiff-HP003081257.aspx |title=About Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) |accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref> As a consequence, Baseline TIFF features became the lowest common denominator for TIFF. Baseline TIFF features are extended in TIFF Extensions (defined in the TIFF 6.0 Part 2 specification) but extensions can also be defined in private tags.\n\nThe TIFF Extensions are formally known as ''TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions''. Here are some examples of TIFF extensions defined in TIFF 6.0 specification:<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n====Compression====\n* CCITT T.4 bi-level encoding\n* CCITT T.6 bi-level encoding\n* LZW Compression scheme\n* JPEG-based compression (TIFF compression scheme 7) uses the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) introduced in 1974 by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao; see Reference 1 in [[Discrete cosine transform]]. For more details see [https://www.adobe.io/content/dam/udp/en/open/standards/tiff/TIFFphotoshop.pdf Adobe document].\n\n====Image types====\n* [[CMYK]] Images\n* [[YCbCr]] Images\n* HalftoneHints\n* Tiled Images\n* [[CIE Lab|CIE L*a*b*]] Images\n\n====Image trees====\nA baseline TIFF file can contain a sequence of images (IFD). Typically, all the images are related but represent different data, such as the pages of a document. In order to explicitly support multiple views of the ''same'' data, the ''SubIFD'' tag was introduced.<ref>[https://www.adobe.io/content/udp/en/open/standards/TIFF/_jcr_content/contentbody/download_1704706507/file.res/TIFFPM6.pdf TIFF Specification Supplement 1], Retrieved 2013-08-04</ref> This allows the images to be defined along a [[tree structure]]. Each image can have a sequence of children, each child being itself an image. The typical usage is to provide thumbnails or several versions of an image in different color spaces.\n\n=====Tiles=====\nA TIFF image may also be composed of a number of tiles. All tiles in the same image have the same dimensions and may be compressed independently of the entire image, similar to strips (see above). Tiled images are part of TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions, so the support for tiled images is not required in Baseline TIFF readers.\n\n====Other extensions====\nAccording to TIFF 6.0 specification (Introduction), all TIFF files using proposed TIFF extensions that are not approved by Adobe as part of Baseline TIFF (typically for specialized uses of TIFF that do not fall within the domain of publishing or general graphics or picture interchange) should be either not called TIFF files or should be marked some way so that they will not be confused with mainstream TIFF files.\n\n==== Private tags ====\nDevelopers can apply for a block of \"private tags\" to enable them to include their own proprietary information inside a TIFF file without causing problems for file interchange. TIFF readers are required to ignore tags that they do not recognize, and a registered developer's private tags are guaranteed not to clash with anyone else's tags or with the standard set of tags defined in the specification. Private tags are numbered in the range 32,768 and higher.\n\nPrivate tags are reserved for information meaningful only for some organization, or for experiments with a new compression scheme within TIFF. Upon request, the TIFF administrator (currently Adobe) will allocate and register one or more private tags for an organization, to avoid possible conflicts with other organizations. Organizations and developers are discouraged from choosing their own tag numbers arbitrarily, because doing so could cause serious compatibility problems. However, if there is little or no chance that TIFF files will escape a private environment, organizations and developers are encouraged to consider using TIFF tags in the \"reusable\" 65,000\u201365,535 range. There is no need to contact Adobe when using numbers in this range.<ref name=\"tiff6\" />\n\n=== Internet Media Type ===\nThe MIME type ''image/tiff'' (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The optional \"application\" parameter (Example: Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo) is defined for image/tiff to identify a particular subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions used in the application parameter must be published as an RFC.<ref name=\"jdf\" />\n\n[[MIME]] type ''image/tiff-fx'' (defined in RFC 3949 and RFC 3950) is based on TIFF 6.0 with TIFF Technical Notes TTN1 (Trees) and TTN2 (Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification). It is used for [[Internet fax]] compatible with the ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white, grayscale and color [[fax]].\n\n===TIFF Compression Tag===\nThe TIFF Tag 259 (0103<sub>16</sub>) stores the information about the Compression method. The default value is 1 = no compression.\n\nMost TIFF writers and TIFF readers support only some TIFF compression schemes. Here are some examples of used TIFF compression schemes:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|+ TIFF Compression Tag<ref name=\"wfax-packbits\" /><ref name=\"tiff-msimaging\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/compression.html |title=Baseline TIFF Tag Compression |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libtiff.org/support.html |title=LibTIFF - TIFF 6.0 Specification Coverage |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-tags.html |title=JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment - TIFF Compression Schemes |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130161333/http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-tags.html |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-hul.html |title=JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment - JHOVE TIFF-hul Module |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210133003/http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/tiff-hul.html |archivedate=December 10, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tiki-lounge.com/~raf/tiff/tifffields.html |title=TIFF Fields |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/content/tiff_tags.shtml |title=Tags for TIFF and Related Specifications |author=Library of Congress Collections |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-images-out.html#file-tiff-save |title=GIMP Documentation - Saving as TIFF |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irfanview.com/history_old.htm |title=IrfanView - History of changes |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Some implementations even use a signed 32-bit offset, running into issues around 2 GiB. BigTIFF is a TIFF variant file format which uses 64-bit offsets and supports much larger files.<ref>{{cite web |title=Extending LibTiff library with support for the new format called BigTIFF|url=http://simplesystems.org/libtiff/bigtiffpr.html}}</ref> The BigTIFF file format specification was implemented in 2007 in development releases of [[LibTIFF]] version 4.0, which was finally released as stable in December 2011. Support for BigTIFF file formats by applications is limited.\n\n=== Digital preservation ===\nAdobe holds the copyright on the TIFF specification (aka TIFF 6.0) along with the two supplements that have been published.  These documents can be found on the Adobe TIFF Resources page.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.io/open/standards/TIFF.html |title=Adobe TIFF Resources page |accessdate=2018-08-10 |df= }}</ref> The [[Fax]] standard in RFC 3949 is based on these TIFF specifications.<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml|title=TIFF, Revision 6.0|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|work=Digital Preservation|date=2014-01-08|accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>\n\nTIFF files that strictly use the basic \"tag sets\" as defined in TIFF 6.0 along with restricting the compression technology to the methods identified in TIFF 6.0 and are adequately tested and verified by multiple sources for all documents being created can be used for storing documents.   Commonly seen issues encountered in the content and [[document management]] industry associated with the use of TIFF files arise when the structures contain proprietary headers, are not properly documented, and/or contain \"wrappers\" or other containers around the TIFF datasets, and/or include improper compression technologies, or those compression technologies are not properly implemented.\n\nVariants of TIFF can be used within [[document imaging]] and content/document management systems using [[ITU-T|CCITT]] [[Group 4 compression|Group IV 2D compression]] which supports [[black-and-white]] (bitonal, [[monochrome]]) images, among other compression technologies that support [[color]]. When storage capacity and network bandwidth was a greater issue than commonly seen in today's server environments, high-volume storage scanning, documents were scanned in black and white (not in color or in grayscale) to conserve storage capacity.\n\nThe inclusion of the SampleFormat tag in TIFF 6.0 allows TIFF files to handle advanced pixel data types, including integer images with more than 8 bits per channel and floating point images. This tag made TIFF 6.0 a viable format for scientific image processing where extended precision is required. An example would be the use of TIFF to store images acquired using scientific CCD cameras that provide up to 16 bits per photosite of intensity resolution. Storing a sequence of images in a single TIFF file is also possible, and is allowed under TIFF 6.0, provided the rules for multi-page images are followed.\n\n=== TIFF/IT ===\n<!-- Section header linked to from redirects -->\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = TIFF/IT\n| extension = .fp, .ct, .lw, .hc, .mp, .bp, .bl, .sd<ref name=\"jdf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cip4.org/documents/jdf_specifications/html/APPX_MimeType_and_MimeTypeVersion_attributes.html |title=JDF Specification - Appendix H MimeType and MimeTypeVersion Attributes |author=CIP4 |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n| mime = not defined<ref name=\"jdf\" />\n| type code =\n| uniform type =\n| owner = ANSI, ISO\n| released = {{start date|1993}}\n| latest release version = TIFF/IT\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2004|df=yes}}\n| genre = [[Image file formats|Image file format]]\n| container for =\n| contained by =\n| extended from = TIFF 6.0\n| extended to =\n| standard = ISO 12639<ref name=\"TIFF/IT\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?Sku=ISO%2012639:2004&PageType=2 |title=ISO 12639:2004 - Graphic technology - Prepress digital data exchange - Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT) |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref><ref name=\"dis12639\">{{citation |url=http://licencepro.estienne.free.fr/Normes/tiffIT_p2.pdf |title=DRAFT INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO/DIS 12639 - Graphic technology \u2014 Prepress digital data exchange \u2014 Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT) - Revision of first edition (ISO 12639:1998) |format=PDF |author=ISO |year=2002 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref>\n}}\nTIFF/IT is used to send data for print-ready pages that have been designed on high-end prepress systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.printingtips.com/glossary-term/t--2360/tiffit.asp |title=Glossary of Printing Terms - TIFF/IT |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> The TIFF/IT specification (ISO 12639) describes a multiple-file format, which can describe a single page per file set.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cip4.org/documents/ppf_specifications/cip3embd_v1_0.pdf |title=CIP3 application note |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> TIFF/IT files are not interchangeable with common TIFF files.<ref name=\"rmg\">{{citation |url=http://www.rgmgraphics.com/Tiff-It.pdf |title=Tiff/It Questions and Answers |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\"issuu\">{{citation |url=http://issuu.com/michaelejahn/docs/jahn_introtopdfx_fontsembed |title=Introduction to PDF/X |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interviewmagspecs.com/Pages/Tiff_It_P1_Specs.html |title=Tiff/It P1 Specifications |quote=Note: TIFF/IT-P1 is not equivalent to a Photoshop\u00ae Tiff! |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n\nThe goals in developing TIFF/IT were to carry forward the original [[IT8]] magnetic-tape formats into a medium-independent version.

The MIME type ''image/tiff'' should not be used for TIFF/IT files, because TIFF/IT does not conform to Baseline TIFF 6.0 and the widely deployed TIFF 6.0 readers cannot read TIFF/IT. The MIME type ''image/tiff'' (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The application parameter should be used with ''image/tiff'' to distinguish TIFF extensions or TIFF subsets. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions must be published as an RFC. There is no such RFC for TIFF/IT.

This subset was developed on the ground of the mutual realization by both the standards and the software development communities that an implementation of the full TIFF/IT standard by any one vendor was both unlikely (because of its complexity), and unnecessary (because Profile 1 would cover most applications for digital ad delivery). Almost all TIFF/IT files in digital advertising were distributed as TIFF/IT-P1 file sets in 2001.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ddap.org/resource_center/tiffit_position_paper.php |title=DDAP Position Statement - TIFF/IT as a File Format for Delivery of Digital Advertising - October, 2001 |date=October 2001 |accessdate=2011-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040111002537/http://www.ddap.org/resource_center/tiffit_position_paper.php |archivedate=2004-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ddap.org/resources/white_papers/TIFFITPosition.pdf |title=DDAP Position Statement - TIFF/IT as a File Format for Delivery of Digital Advertising - October, 2001 |date=October 2001 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030321070342/http://www.ddap.org/resources/white_papers/TIFFITPosition.pdf |archivedate=March 21, 2003 }}</ref> When people talk about TIFF/IT, they usually mean the P1 standard.<ref name=\"prepressure-tiffit\" />\n\nHere are some of the restrictions on TIFF/IT-P1 (compared to TIFF/IT):<ref name=\"harl8\" />\n* Uses CMYK only (when appropriate)\n* It is pixel interleaved (when appropriate)\n* Has a single choice of image orientation\n* Has a single choice of dot range\n* Restricted compression methods\n\nTIFF/IT-P1 is a simplified conformance level of TIFF/IT and it maximizes the compatibility between Color Electronic Prepress Systems (CEPS) and Desk Top Publishing (DTP) worlds.<ref name=\"ipa\">{{citation|url=http://www.ipa.org/pdf/bulletin/ddap_tiff_pdf.pdf |title=DDAP, TIFF/IT-P1, PDF-X/1 |year=1998 |accessdate=2011-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215234111/http://www.ipa.org/pdf/bulletin/ddap_tiff_pdf.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"tiffitonline\">{{cite web |url=http://tiffit-online.com/about.html |title=TIFF/IT-P1 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> It provides a clean interface for the proprietary CEPS formats such as the [[Scitex CT]]/LW format.\n\n====TIFF/IT P2====\n<!-- Section header linked to from redirects -->\nBecause TIFF/IT P1 had a number of limitations, an extended format was developed. The ISO 12639:2004 introduced a new extended conformance level - TIFF/IT-P2 (Profile 2). TIFF/IT-P2 added a number of functions to TIFF/IT-P1 like:<ref name=\"prepressure-tiffit\" />\n* CMYK spot colors only (when appropriate)\n* Support for the compression of CT and BP data (JPEG and Deflate)\n* Support for multiple LW and CT files in a single file\n* Support for copydot files through a new file type called SD (Screened Data)\n* There was some effort to create a possibility to concatenate FP, LW, and CT files into a single file called the GF (Group Final) file, but this was not defined in a draft version of ISO 12639:2004.<ref name=\"dis12639\" />\n\nThis format was not widely used.\n\n==== Private tags ====\nThe TIFF/IT specification preserved the TIFF possibility for developers to utilize private tags. The TIFF/IT specification is very precise regarding how these private tags should be treated - they should be parsed, but ignored.<ref name=\"tiffitprivatetags\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ddap.com/resources/privatetags_faqs.html |title=TIFF/IT Private Tags |author=DDAP Association |year=2002 |accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428202922/http://www.ddap.com/resources/privatetags_faqs.html |archivedate=April 28, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nPrivate tags in the TIFF/IT-P1 specification were originally intended to provide developers with ways to add specific functionality for specific applications. Private tags can be used by developers (e.g., Scitex) to preserve specific printing values or other functionality. Private tags are typically labelled with tag numbers greater than or equal to 32768.\n\nAll private tags must be requested from Adobe (the TIFF administrator) and registered.\n\nIn 1992, the DDAP (Digital Distribution of Advertising for Publication, later Digital Directions in Applications for Production) developed their requirement statement for digital ad delivery. This was presented to  ANSI-accredited CGATS (Committee for Graphic Arts Technology Standards) for development of an accredited file format standard for the delivery of digital ads. CGATS reviewed their alternatives for this purpose and TIFF seemed like the ideal candidate, except for the fact that it could not handle certain required functionalities. CGATS asked Aldus (the TIFF administrator) for a block of their own TIFF private tags in order to implement what eventually became TIFF/IT. For example, the ability to identify the sequence of the colors is handled by tag 34017 - the Color Sequence Tag.<ref name=\"tiffitprivatetags\" />\n\nTIFF/IT was created to satisfy the need for a transport-independent method of encoding raster data in the IT8.1,\nIT8.2 and IT8.5 standards.\n\n=== Standards ===\nTIFF/IT was defined in ANSI IT8.8\u20131993 standard in 1993 and later revised in the International Standard ''ISO 12639:1998 - Prepress digital data exchange \u2013 Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT)''.<ref name=\"TIFF/IT\" /> The ISO standard replaces ANSI IT8.8\u20131993. It specifies a media-independent means for prepress electronic data exchange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.printingtips.com/email-term/t--2361/tiffitp1.asp |title=Glossary of Printing Terms - TIFF/IT-P1 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe ISO 12639:2004 (Second edition) standard for TIFF/IT superseded the ISO 12639:1998. It was also later extended in ISO 12639:2004 / Amd. 1:2007 - Use of JBIG2-Amd2 compression in TIFF/IT.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat|Tagged Image File Format}}\n*[[Comparison of graphics file formats]]\n*[[Libtiff]], widely used open source library + utilities for reading/writing/manipulating TIFF files\n*[[Digital Negative (file format)|DNG]]\n*[[GeoTIFF]]\n*[[Image file formats]]\n*[[STDU Viewer]]\n*[[Windows Photo Viewer]]\n*[[T.37 (ITU-T recommendation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.adobe.io/open/standards/TIFF.html Adobe TIFF Resources page]: Adobe links to the specification and main TIFF resources\n*[http://simplesystems.org/libtiff/ LibTIFF Home Page]: Widely used library used for reading and writing TIFF files as well as TIFF file processing command line tools\n*[http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html TIFF File Format FAQ and TIFF Tag Reference]: Everything you always wanted to know about the TIFF File Format but were afraid to ask\n*[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml TIFF description] at Digital Preservation (The Library of Congress)\n*[http://cool.conservation-us.org/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff4.html TIFF Revision 4.0]: Specification for revision 4.0, in HTML (warning: for historical purposes only, the TIFF 6.0 spec contains the full 4.0 revision)\n*[http://cool.conservation-us.org/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html TIFF Revision 5.0]: Specification for revision 5.0, in HTML (warning: for historical purposes only, the TIFF 6.0 spec contains the full 5.0 revision)\n*[https://www.adobe.io/content/dam/udp/en/open/standards/tiff/TIFF6.pdf TIFF Revision 6.0]: Specification for revision 6.0, in PDF (warning: there is an outdated and flawed section (jpeg compression), corrected in supplements, and there are additions to this PDF too \u2013 for the full specification, see the [https://www.adobe.io/open/standards/TIFF.html Adobe TIFF Resources page]\n* RFC 3302 - image/tiff, RFC 3949 and RFC 3950 - image/tiff-fx, RFC 2306 - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) - F Profile for Facsimile, RFC 1314 - legacy exchange of images in the Internet.\n*[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36958 Code Tiff Tag Reader] - Easy readable code of a TIFF tag reader in Mathworks Matlab (Tiff 5.0/6.0)\n*[http://www.alternatiff.com/ AlternaTIFF]  - Free in-browser TIFF viewer\n* eiStream Annotation (also known as Wang or Kodak Annotation).

The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth. At the allocation ceremony, the remaining contestants all split the prize money since they all experienced personal growth in their dating life.\n\nSeveral publications have compared the format of ''Too Hot to Handle'' to that of ''[[Love Island (franchise)|Love Island]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curto |first1=Justin |title=Netflix\u2019s Too Hot to Handle Will Fill the Love Is Blind\u2013Size Hole in Your Life |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-trailer-netflix.html |website=vulture.com |publisher=Vulture |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Baty |first1=Emma |title=Netflix Just Made Their Own Version of 'Love Island,' but the Contestants Can\u2019t Hook Up With Each Other |url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a32109096/netflix-too-hot-to-handle-trailer/ |website=cosmopolitan.com |publisher=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration.

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.

WWC is known for its curriculum that combines academics, work, and service. This system requires every student to complete a requisite course of study, work an on-campus job, and perform [[community service]]. Warren Wilson is one of the few colleges in the United States that requires students to work for the institution in order to graduate and is one of only nine colleges in the [[work college|Work Colleges Consortium]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A Triad of Academics, Work, and Service| publisher = WWC | url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/triad/index.php | accessdate = 5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe college is notable for its surrounding environment. The campus includes a {{convert|275|acre|km2|adj=on}} working [[farm]], [[Market gardening|market garden]], and {{convert|625|acres|km2}} of managed forest with {{convert|25|mi|km}} of hiking trails.<ref name=\"fastfacts\">{{cite web | title = WWC Fast Facts| publisher = Warren Wilson College | url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/admission/facts.php | accessdate = 2 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nWarren Wilson College is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Farm copy.jpg|thumb|right|Warren Wilson College Farm]]\n\nWarren Wilson College went through many phases before becoming what it is today. Its property, situated along the [[Swannanoa River]], was purchased in 1893 by the Women's Board of Home Missions of the [[Presbyterian Church]]. They were concerned that many Americans in isolated areas were not getting a proper education and decided to establish church-supported schools in impoverished areas.<ref name=\"WWC History\"/> On November 30, 1894, the Asheville Farm School officially opened on 420 acres, with 25 students attending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/11/30/today-asheville-history-farm-school-opens/76551410/|title=Today in Asheville history: Farm school opens|work=Asheville Citizen-Times|date=30 November 2015|access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref> A professional staff of three offered the first three grades of elementary instruction.\n\nIn 1923, the school graduated its first high school class. The first post-high school programs offering vocational training began in 1936.<ref name=\"WWC History\">[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/info/history.php \"History of Warren Wilson College\"] Accessed 4 July 2010.</ref> In 1942, the Asheville Farm School merged with the [[Dorland-Bell School]] in [[Hot Springs, North Carolina]], to become a coed secondary school. It was named Warren H. Wilson Vocational Junior College and Associated Schools, after the late Warren H. Wilson, former superintendent of the Presbyterian Church's Department of Church and Country Life.<ref>{{cite web | title = Warren H.

In 1952, the college became one of the first in the South to desegregate, when it invited Alma Shippy, an African American from [[Swannanoa, North Carolina]], to attend. Sunderland dorm residents voted 54-1 to allow Shippy to become a student and live in their dorm.<ref>{{cite news | title = Honoring an alum who was also a civil rights pioneer | publisher = LA Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/25/news/adna-jrcollege25 | access-date = 5 July 2010 | date=25 February 2007 | first=Margaret | last=Lillard}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to its original student population of underprivileged mountain youth, Warren Wilson now enrolls students of many different geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Warren Wilson College was a junior college until 1967, when it became a four-year college offering six majors. In 1972, the National Board of Missions deeded the WWC property over to the college's [[Board of Trustees]].\n\nThe eighth president, Dr. Lynn Morton, is the first female president in the college's history. She is a native North Carolinian and was formerly provost and vice president of academic affairs at [[Queens University of Charlotte|Queens University]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Warren Wilson's Eighth President is Lynn M.

WWC is known for its curriculum that combines academics, work, and service. This system requires every student to complete a requisite course of study, work an on-campus job, and perform [[community service]]. Warren Wilson is one of the few colleges in the United States that requires students to work for the institution in order to graduate and is one of only nine colleges in the [[work college|Work Colleges Consortium]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A Triad of Academics, Work, and Service| publisher = WWC | url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/triad/index.php | accessdate = 5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe college is notable for its surrounding environment. The campus includes a {{convert|275|acre|km2|adj=on}} working [[farm]], [[Market gardening|market garden]], and {{convert|625|acres|km2}} of managed forest with {{convert|25|mi|km}} of hiking trails.<ref name=\"fastfacts\">{{cite web | title = WWC Fast Facts| publisher = Warren Wilson College | url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/admission/facts.php | accessdate = 2 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nWarren Wilson College is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Farm copy.jpg|thumb|right|Warren Wilson College Farm]]\n\nWarren Wilson College went through many phases before becoming what it is today. Its property, situated along the [[Swannanoa River]], was purchased in 1893 by the Women's Board of Home Missions of the [[Presbyterian Church]]. They were concerned that many Americans in isolated areas were not getting a proper education and decided to establish church-supported schools in impoverished areas.<ref name=\"WWC History\"/> On November 30, 1894, the Asheville Farm School officially opened on 420 acres, with 25 students attending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/11/30/today-asheville-history-farm-school-opens/76551410/|title=Today in Asheville history: Farm school opens|work=Asheville Citizen-Times|date=30 November 2015|access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref> A professional staff of three offered the first three grades of elementary instruction.\n\nIn 1923, the school graduated its first high school class. The first post-high school programs offering vocational training began in 1936.<ref name=\"WWC History\">[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/info/history.php \"History of Warren Wilson College\"] Accessed 4 July 2010.</ref> In 1942, the Asheville Farm School merged with the [[Dorland-Bell School]] in [[Hot Springs, North Carolina]], to become a coed secondary school. It was named Warren H. Wilson Vocational Junior College and Associated Schools, after the late Warren H. Wilson, former superintendent of the Presbyterian Church's Department of Church and Country Life.<ref>{{cite web | title = Warren H.

In 1952, the college became one of the first in the South to desegregate, when it invited Alma Shippy, an African American from [[Swannanoa, North Carolina]], to attend. Sunderland dorm residents voted 54-1 to allow Shippy to become a student and live in their dorm.<ref>{{cite news | title = Honoring an alum who was also a civil rights pioneer | publisher = LA Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/25/news/adna-jrcollege25 | access-date = 5 July 2010 | date=25 February 2007 | first=Margaret | last=Lillard}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to its original student population of underprivileged mountain youth, Warren Wilson now enrolls students of many different geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Warren Wilson College was a junior college until 1967, when it became a four-year college offering six majors. In 1972, the National Board of Missions deeded the WWC property over to the college's [[Board of Trustees]].\n\nThe eighth president, Dr. Lynn Morton, is the first female president in the college's history.

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

The city is also used as a base from which to explore the rest of Tasmania.\n\nThe last 15\u201320 years has seen Hobart's wine industry thrive as many vineyards have developed in countryside areas outside of the city in the Coal River Wine Region and [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], including [[Moorilla Estate]] at [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]] one of the most awarded vineyards in Australia.\n\n===Antarctic bases===\nHobart is an Antarctic gateway city, with geographical proximity to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]]. Hobart is a logistics point for the French icebreaker [[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|''L'Astrolabe'']].\n\nHobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.\n\nTasmania has a high concentration of Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists.

Completed in 1840, it was used as Tasmania's parliament house, and is now commemorated by a pub bearing the same name (built in 1844) which is frequented by yachtsmen after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart yacht race]].\n\nHobart is also home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847. St Joseph's was built in 1840. [[St David's Cathedral, Hobart|St David's Cathedral]], Hobart's first cathedral, was consecrated in 1874.\n\nHobart has very few [[high rise]] buildings in comparison to other Australian cities. This is partly a result of height limits imposed due to Hobart's proximity to [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]] and [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/f041c176-60f4-43ec-a5a7-a2dc00a2259f/final_draft_24_feb_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411225641/http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/f041c176-60f4-43ec-a5a7-a2dc00a2259f/final_draft_24_feb_2014.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobart, TAS.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Colonial-era buildings along Hunter Street]]\n\n==Culture==\n===Arts and entertainment===\n[[File:Theatre Royal Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|[[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], Australia's oldest continually operating theatre<ref>{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Paul|title=3 November, 2009 12:55&nbsp;pm AEDT The Theatre Royal celebrates 175 years|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2009/11/03/2731770.htm|accessdate=24 May 2013|date=3 November 2009|agency=ABC.net}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cascade Brewery 2015.jpg|thumb|Completed in 1824, [[Cascade Brewery]], like many old buildings in Hobart, was built using convict labour.]][[File:Hobart-Tasmania-Australia01.JPG|thumb|Elizabeth Street, Hobart's main shopping precinct]]\nHobart is home to the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]], which is resident at the [[Federation Concert Hall]] on the city's waterfront.

The arrival of the yachts is celebrated as part of the [[Hobart Summer Festival]], a food and wine festival beginning just after Christmas and ending in mid-January. The [[Taste of Tasmania]] is a major part of the festival, where locals and visitors can taste fine local and international food and wine.\n\nThe city is the finishing point of the [[Targa Tasmania]] rally car event, which has been held annually in April since 1991.\n\nThe annual [[Tulip]] Festival at the [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]] is a popular Spring celebration in the city.\n\nThe [[Australian Wooden Boat Festival]] is a biennial event held in Hobart celebrating wooden boats. It is held concurrently with the [[Royal Hobart Regatta]], which began in 1830 and is therefore Tasmania's oldest surviving sporting event.\n\n===Sport===\n{{See also|Sport in Tasmania}}\n[[File:Bellerive oval hobart.jpg|thumb|[[Blundstone Arena]] is home to [[cricket]] and [[Australian rules football]], Hobart's two most popular spectator sports.]]\n\nMost professional Hobart-based sports teams represent Tasmania as a whole rather than exclusively the city.\n\n[[Cricket]] is a popular game of the city. The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] on the Eastern Shore. A new team, [[Hobart Hurricanes]] represent the city in the [[Big Bash League]]. [[Bellerive Oval]] has been the breeding ground of some world class cricket players including the former Australia captain [[Ricky Ponting]].\n\nDespite [[Australian rules football]]'s huge popularity in the state of Tasmania, the state does not have a team in the [[Australian Football League]]. However, a [[Tasmanian AFL bid|bid for an Tasmanian AFL team]] is a popular topic among football fans. The State government is one of the potential sponsors of such a team. Local domestic club football is still played. [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] football features five clubs from Hobart, and other leagues such as [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]] and the Old Scholars Football Association are also played each Winter.\n\nThe city has two local [[rugby league]] football teams (Hobart Tigers and South Hobart Storm) that compete in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]].\n\nTasmania is not represented by teams in the [[National Rugby League|NRL]], [[Super Rugby]], [[ANZ Championship]], [[A-League]], or [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]]. However, the [[Hobart Chargers]] do represent Hobart in the second-tier [[South East Australian Basketball League]]. Besides the bid for an [[Australian Football League|AFL]] club which was passed over in favour of [[Gold Coast Football Club|a second Queensland team]], despite several major local businesses and the Premier pioneering for a club, there is also a [[Tasmania United FC|Hobart bid]] for entry into the A-League.\n\nHockey Tasmania has a men's team (the Tasmanian Tigers) and a women's team (the Van Demons) competing in the [[Australian Hockey League]].

Hobart also includes the urbanised local governments of the [[Municipality of Kingborough]] and [[Brighton Council (Tasmania)|Municipality of Brighton]]. Each local government services all the suburbs that are within its geographical boundaries and are responsible for their own urban area, up to a certain scale, and residential planning as well as waste management and mains water storage.\n\nMost citywide events such as the Taste of Tasmania and Hobart Summer Festival are funded by the Tasmanian State Government as a joint venture with the Hobart City Council. Urban planning of the Hobart CBD in particular the Heritage listed areas such as Sullivans Cove are also intensely scrutinised by State Government, which is operated out of Parliament House on the waterfront.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n{{See also|Education in Tasmania}}\n[[File:UTAS Centenary Building.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Tasmania]]'s Centenary Building, Sandy Bay campus]]\n\nHobart is home to the main campus of the [[University of Tasmania]], located in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]].

Other campuses are in Launceston and Burnie.\n\nThe Greater Hobart area contains 122 primary, secondary and pretertiary (College) schools distributed throughout Clarence, Glenorchy and Hobart City Councils and Kingborough and Brighton Municipalities. These schools are made up of a mix of public, catholic, private and independent run, with the heaviest distribution lying in the more densely populated West around the Hobart city core.

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|left|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]]. This upgrade was, in part, funded under a promise made during the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] by the Abbott government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600|title=Airport works under way|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{See also|Category:People from Hobart}}\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:Errol Flynn1.jpg|200px|thumb|Actor [[Errol Flynn]] was born in Hobart in 1909.]]\n\n* [[Asta (musician)|Asta]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Phillip Borsos]], best known for his films ''[[The Mean Season]]'' (1985) and ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985)\n* [[Essie Davis]], actress\n* [[Richard Flanagan]], author\n* [[Errol Flynn]], Hollywood actor\n* [[Frederick Frith]], painter and photographer\n* [[Lisa Gormley]], English-born Australian actress best known for playing [[Bianca Scott]] on the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] serial drama ''[[Home and Away]]''\n* [[Lucky Grills]], best known for portraying the unconventional detective \"Bluey\" Hills in the television series ''[[Bluey (TV series)|Bluey]]'' in 1976.\n* [[Robert Grubb]], actor\n* [[John Harwood (writer)|John Harwood]], writer and poet\n* [[Ernest Higgins|Ernest]], [[Tasman Higgins|Tasman]] and [[Arthur Higgins]], brothers and pioneering [[cinematographer]]s during the [[silent era]]\n* [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], Australian classical composer\n* [[William Kermode]], artist\n* [[Constantine Koukias]], a Greek-Australian composer and [[flautist]]\n* [[Louise Lovely]], the first Australian motion picture actress to find success in Hollywood\n* [[Dennis Miller (Australian actor)|Dennis Miller]], actor best known for his recurring role on ''[[Blue Heelers]]'' as Ex-Sergeant [[List of recurring Blue Heelers characters#Pat Doyle|Pat Doyle]] (1994\u20132000).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588223/|title=Dennis Miller (II)|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]], most noted for playing the long-running role of Terry Sullivan in the Australian television series [[The Sullivans]].\n* [[Tara Morice]], actress\n* [[Gerda Nicolson]], actress\n* [[Glenn Richards]], musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist with [[Augie March]]\n* [[Brian Ritchie]], musician, bassist of [[Violent Femmes]]\n* [[Clive Sansom]], poet and playwright\n* [[Don Sharp]], actor\n* [[Michael Siberry]], actor\n* [[Jaason Simmons]], actor best known for his role as life guard [[Logan Fowler]] in the TV series ''[[Baywatch]]''\n* [[Freya Stafford]], actress who has appeared on TV programs such as ''[[Head Start (TV series)|Head Start]]'' and ''[[White Collar Blue]]'' and the 2010 horror film, ''[[The Clinic (2010 film)|The Clinic]]''\n* [[Amali Ward#Amali Ward|Amali Ward]], ''[[Australian Idol (season 2)|Australian Idol]]'' Season 2 finalist\n* [[Charles A.

In 1804, along with the military, settlers and convicts from the abandoned Port Phillip settlement, the camp at Risdon Cove was moved by Captain David Collins to a better location at the present site of Hobart at [[Sullivans Cove]].

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

The city is also used as a base from which to explore the rest of Tasmania.\n\nThe last 15\u201320 years has seen Hobart's wine industry thrive as many vineyards have developed in countryside areas outside of the city in the Coal River Wine Region and [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], including [[Moorilla Estate]] at [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]] one of the most awarded vineyards in Australia.\n\n===Antarctic bases===\nHobart is an Antarctic gateway city, with geographical proximity to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]]. Hobart is a logistics point for the French icebreaker [[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|''L'Astrolabe'']].\n\nHobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.\n\nTasmania has a high concentration of Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists.

Completed in 1840, it was used as Tasmania's parliament house, and is now commemorated by a pub bearing the same name (built in 1844) which is frequented by yachtsmen after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart yacht race]].\n\nHobart is also home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847. St Joseph's was built in 1840. [[St David's Cathedral, Hobart|St David's Cathedral]], Hobart's first cathedral, was consecrated in 1874.\n\nHobart has very few [[high rise]] buildings in comparison to other Australian cities. This is partly a result of height limits imposed due to Hobart's proximity to [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]] and [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/f041c176-60f4-43ec-a5a7-a2dc00a2259f/final_draft_24_feb_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411225641/http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/f041c176-60f4-43ec-a5a7-a2dc00a2259f/final_draft_24_feb_2014.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobart, TAS.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Colonial-era buildings along Hunter Street]]\n\n==Culture==\n===Arts and entertainment===\n[[File:Theatre Royal Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|[[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], Australia's oldest continually operating theatre<ref>{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Paul|title=3 November, 2009 12:55&nbsp;pm AEDT The Theatre Royal celebrates 175 years|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2009/11/03/2731770.htm|accessdate=24 May 2013|date=3 November 2009|agency=ABC.net}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cascade Brewery 2015.jpg|thumb|Completed in 1824, [[Cascade Brewery]], like many old buildings in Hobart, was built using convict labour.]][[File:Hobart-Tasmania-Australia01.JPG|thumb|Elizabeth Street, Hobart's main shopping precinct]]\nHobart is home to the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]], which is resident at the [[Federation Concert Hall]] on the city's waterfront.

Hobart also plays host to the University of Tasmania's acclaimed Australian International Symphony Orchestra Institute (AISOI) which brings pre-professional advanced young musicians to town from all over Australia and internationally. The AISOI plays host to a public concert season during the first two weeks of December every year focusing on large symphonic music. Like the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, the AISOI uses the [[Federation Concert Hall]] as its performing base.\n\nHobart is home to Australia's oldest [[theatre (structure)|theatre]], the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], as well as the Playhouse theatre, the Backspace theatre and many smaller stage theatres. It also has three [[Village Roadshow Limited|Village Cinema]] complexes, one each in Hobart CBD, [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]], with the possibility of a fourth being developed in Kingston.

Major national and international music events are usually held at the [[Derwent Entertainment Centre]], or the [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino|Casino]].

The arrival of the yachts is celebrated as part of the [[Hobart Summer Festival]], a food and wine festival beginning just after Christmas and ending in mid-January. The [[Taste of Tasmania]] is a major part of the festival, where locals and visitors can taste fine local and international food and wine.\n\nThe city is the finishing point of the [[Targa Tasmania]] rally car event, which has been held annually in April since 1991.\n\nThe annual [[Tulip]] Festival at the [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]] is a popular Spring celebration in the city.\n\nThe [[Australian Wooden Boat Festival]] is a biennial event held in Hobart celebrating wooden boats. It is held concurrently with the [[Royal Hobart Regatta]], which began in 1830 and is therefore Tasmania's oldest surviving sporting event.\n\n===Sport===\n{{See also|Sport in Tasmania}}\n[[File:Bellerive oval hobart.jpg|thumb|[[Blundstone Arena]] is home to [[cricket]] and [[Australian rules football]], Hobart's two most popular spectator sports.]]\n\nMost professional Hobart-based sports teams represent Tasmania as a whole rather than exclusively the city.\n\n[[Cricket]] is a popular game of the city. The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] on the Eastern Shore. A new team, [[Hobart Hurricanes]] represent the city in the [[Big Bash League]]. [[Bellerive Oval]] has been the breeding ground of some world class cricket players including the former Australia captain [[Ricky Ponting]].\n\nDespite [[Australian rules football]]'s huge popularity in the state of Tasmania, the state does not have a team in the [[Australian Football League]]. However, a [[Tasmanian AFL bid|bid for an Tasmanian AFL team]] is a popular topic among football fans. The State government is one of the potential sponsors of such a team. Local domestic club football is still played. [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] football features five clubs from Hobart, and other leagues such as [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]] and the Old Scholars Football Association are also played each Winter.\n\nThe city has two local [[rugby league]] football teams (Hobart Tigers and South Hobart Storm) that compete in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]].\n\nTasmania is not represented by teams in the [[National Rugby League|NRL]], [[Super Rugby]], [[ANZ Championship]], [[A-League]], or [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]]. However, the [[Hobart Chargers]] do represent Hobart in the second-tier [[South East Australian Basketball League]]. Besides the bid for an [[Australian Football League|AFL]] club which was passed over in favour of [[Gold Coast Football Club|a second Queensland team]], despite several major local businesses and the Premier pioneering for a club, there is also a [[Tasmania United FC|Hobart bid]] for entry into the A-League.\n\nHockey Tasmania has a men's team (the Tasmanian Tigers) and a women's team (the Van Demons) competing in the [[Australian Hockey League]].

The paper is owned and operated by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Limited]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Hobart-Tasmania-Australia04.JPG|thumb|Parliament House of Tasmania]]\n\nGreater Hobart metropolitan area consists of five local government areas of which three, [[City of Hobart]], [[City of Glenorchy]] and [[City of Clarence]] are designated as cities. Hobart also includes the urbanised local governments of the [[Municipality of Kingborough]] and [[Brighton Council (Tasmania)|Municipality of Brighton]]. Each local government services all the suburbs that are within its geographical boundaries and are responsible for their own urban area, up to a certain scale, and residential planning as well as waste management and mains water storage.\n\nMost citywide events such as the Taste of Tasmania and Hobart Summer Festival are funded by the Tasmanian State Government as a joint venture with the Hobart City Council. Urban planning of the Hobart CBD in particular the Heritage listed areas such as Sullivans Cove are also intensely scrutinised by State Government, which is operated out of Parliament House on the waterfront.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n{{See also|Education in Tasmania}}\n[[File:UTAS Centenary Building.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Tasmania]]'s Centenary Building, Sandy Bay campus]]\n\nHobart is home to the main campus of the [[University of Tasmania]], located in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]].

Other campuses are in Launceston and Burnie.\n\nThe Greater Hobart area contains 122 primary, secondary and pretertiary (College) schools distributed throughout Clarence, Glenorchy and Hobart City Councils and Kingborough and Brighton Municipalities. These schools are made up of a mix of public, catholic, private and independent run, with the heaviest distribution lying in the more densely populated West around the Hobart city core. [[TasTAFE]] operates a total of seven polytechnic campuses within the Greater Hobart area that provide vocational education and training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tastafe.tas.edu.au/about/|title=About us \u2013 TasTAFE|work=TasTAFE|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\n[[Royal Hobart Hospital]] is a major [[public hospital]] in central Hobart with 501 beds, which also serves as a [[teaching hospital]] for the University of Tasmania.\n\nA private hospital, [[Hobart Private Hospital]] is located adjacent to it and operated by Australian healthcare provider [[Healthscope]].

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|left|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]]. This upgrade was, in part, funded under a promise made during the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] by the Abbott government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600|title=Airport works under way|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{See also|Category:People from Hobart}}\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:Errol Flynn1.jpg|200px|thumb|Actor [[Errol Flynn]] was born in Hobart in 1909.]]\n\n* [[Asta (musician)|Asta]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Phillip Borsos]], best known for his films ''[[The Mean Season]]'' (1985) and ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985)\n* [[Essie Davis]], actress\n* [[Richard Flanagan]], author\n* [[Errol Flynn]], Hollywood actor\n* [[Frederick Frith]], painter and photographer\n* [[Lisa Gormley]], English-born Australian actress best known for playing [[Bianca Scott]] on the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] serial drama ''[[Home and Away]]''\n* [[Lucky Grills]], best known for portraying the unconventional detective \"Bluey\" Hills in the television series ''[[Bluey (TV series)|Bluey]]'' in 1976.\n* [[Robert Grubb]], actor\n* [[John Harwood (writer)|John Harwood]], writer and poet\n* [[Ernest Higgins|Ernest]], [[Tasman Higgins|Tasman]] and [[Arthur Higgins]], brothers and pioneering [[cinematographer]]s during the [[silent era]]\n* [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], Australian classical composer\n* [[William Kermode]], artist\n* [[Constantine Koukias]], a Greek-Australian composer and [[flautist]]\n* [[Louise Lovely]], the first Australian motion picture actress to find success in Hollywood\n* [[Dennis Miller (Australian actor)|Dennis Miller]], actor best known for his recurring role on ''[[Blue Heelers]]'' as Ex-Sergeant [[List of recurring Blue Heelers characters#Pat Doyle|Pat Doyle]] (1994\u20132000).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588223/|title=Dennis Miller (II)|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]], most noted for playing the long-running role of Terry Sullivan in the Australian television series [[The Sullivans]].\n* [[Tara Morice]], actress\n* [[Gerda Nicolson]], actress\n* [[Glenn Richards]], musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist with [[Augie March]]\n* [[Brian Ritchie]], musician, bassist of [[Violent Femmes]]\n* [[Clive Sansom]], poet and playwright\n* [[Don Sharp]], actor\n* [[Michael Siberry]], actor\n* [[Jaason Simmons]], actor best known for his role as life guard [[Logan Fowler]] in the TV series ''[[Baywatch]]''\n* [[Freya Stafford]], actress who has appeared on TV programs such as ''[[Head Start (TV series)|Head Start]]'' and ''[[White Collar Blue]]'' and the 2010 horror film, ''[[The Clinic (2010 film)|The Clinic]]''\n* [[Amali Ward#Amali Ward|Amali Ward]], ''[[Australian Idol (season 2)|Australian Idol]]'' Season 2 finalist\n* [[Charles A.

A [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club man]], he was Liverpool's [[captain (association football)|vice-captain]] for 10 years, and is the club's second-longest ever serving player, making his 737th appearance for Liverpool in all competitions on 19 May 2013. Carragher also holds the record for the most appearances in European competition for Liverpool with 150. He is also Liverpool\u2019s record holder for spitting on kids. \n\nCarragher started his career at the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|Liverpool Academy]], making his professional debut in the [[1996\u201397 Liverpool F.C. season|1996\u201397 season]], and becoming a first team regular the following season. Having initially played as a full-back, the arrival of manager [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] in 2004 saw Carragher move to become a centre-back, where he found his best form. His honours with Liverpool total two [[FA Cup]]s, three [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], two [[FA Community Shield|Community Shields]], one [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], one [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and two [[UEFA Super Cup|Super Cups]].\n\nInternationally, Carragher held the national record for most caps at under-21 level and earned his senior debut in 1999.

He did, however, temporarily come out of retirement in order to represent England at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], before retiring again with 38 senior England caps.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 2013, Carragher joined [[Sky Sports]] where he appears as a co-commentator alongside [[Martin Tyler]], [[Rob Hawthorne]], [[Bill Leslie (commentator)]] and also as a pundit with [[Graeme Souness]], [[Gary Neville]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]].<ref name=\"www1.skysports.com\">[http://www1.skysports.com/news/11661/8680593/ Jamie Carragher joins the Sky Sports team for the 2013/14 season].

A [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club man]], he was Liverpool's [[captain (association football)|vice-captain]] for 10 years, and is the club's second-longest ever serving player, making his 737th appearance for Liverpool in all competitions on 19 May 2013.

Having initially played as a full-back, the arrival of manager [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] in 2004 saw Carragher move to become a centre-back, where he found his best form. His honours with Liverpool total two [[FA Cup]]s, three [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], two [[FA Community Shield|Community Shields]], one [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], one [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and two [[UEFA Super Cup|Super Cups]].\n\nInternationally, Carragher held the national record for most caps at under-21 level and earned his senior debut in 1999.
