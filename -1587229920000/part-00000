lack of a political consensus behind the Chequers proposal and said that, due to a 'stalemate' in the House of Commons, the issue of Brexit should be referred back to the electorate. She proposed a referendum with three options: to leave the EU on such terms as might be agreed between the UK Government and the EU 27; to leave the EU without agreed terms; or to remain in the EU. Voters would be asked to mark a first and second preference using the [[supplementary vote]] system. If there were no majority for any particular option among first-preference votes, the third-placed option would be eliminated and second preferences would be used to determine the winner from the two remaining options.<ref>{{cite news|title=Justine Greening's call for new Brexit referendum rejected by No 10|date=16 July 2018|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44840154|accessdate=19 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following table shows opinion polls that have been conducted on how people would vote in a three-option referendum.

lack of a political consensus behind the Chequers proposal and said that, due to a 'stalemate' in the House of Commons, the issue of Brexit should be referred back to the electorate. She proposed a referendum with three options: to leave the EU on such terms as might be agreed between the UK Government and the EU 27; to leave the EU without agreed terms; or to remain in the EU. Voters would be asked to mark a first and second preference using the [[supplementary vote]] system. If there were no majority for any particular option among first-preference votes, the third-placed option would be eliminated and second preferences would be used to determine the winner from the two remaining options.<ref>{{cite news|title=Justine Greening's call for new Brexit referendum rejected by No 10|date=16 July 2018|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44840154|accessdate=19 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following table shows opinion polls that have been conducted on how people would vote in a three-option referendum.

It is a [[constituent college]] of the [[University of London]]. It was founded in 1891 as '''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute''' by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] in [[New Cross]], London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed '''Goldsmiths' College'''. The word ''College'' was dropped from its branding in 2006, but Goldsmiths' College, with the [[apostrophe]], remains the institution's formal legal name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |title=Rebranding FAQs |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |quote=it is now known as Goldsmiths, University of London.|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225110856/http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |archivedate = 25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nNearly 20% of students come from outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Goldsmiths Main Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Richard Hoggart]] Building]]\nIn 1891, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], one of the [[City of London]] [[Livery Companies]], founded ''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute'' (more commonly referred to simply as the \"Goldsmiths' Institute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=5499&inst_id=29 |title=Goldsmiths' College archives |publisher=Aim25.ac.uk |date=29 September 1905 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>). The Goldsmiths' Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to \"the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes\". The original Institute was based in New Cross at the former [[Royal Naval School]] building. (This building, which was designed by the architect [[John Shaw Jr]], is now known as the ''Richard Hoggart Building'' and remains the main building of the campus today.)\n\n[[File:From the Services To Schoolmastering- Re-training at Goldsmith's College, London University, Nottingham, England, 1944 D22754.jpg|thumbnail|left|Goldsmiths College students at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1944]]\nIn 1904, the Institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as '''Goldsmiths' College'''. (The apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word 'College' dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher's Certificate course. The College also ran its own Nursery School.\n\nShortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]], at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the College to [[University of Nottingham|University College, Nottingham]], a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an [[incendiary bomb]] and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947).\n\nDuring the 1960s Goldsmiths experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and [[social science]] fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former [[Deptford]] [[Town Hall]] and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain [[Grade II listed]] building status.\n\nIn 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the [[University of London]] and in 1990 received its [[Royal Charter]]. Among its [[List of Goldsmiths College people#List of Wardens of Goldsmiths|wardens]] have been [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Andrew Rutherford (English scholar)|Andrew Rutherford]] and [[Ben Pimlott]]. The current, and first woman, Warden is Francis Corner.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357165/Revealed-BBC-boss-landed-866k-payoff-walked-straight-public-sector-job.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Revealed: BBC boss who landed \u00a3866k payoff and walked straight into another public-sector job}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the former boiler house and public laundry of Laurie Grove Baths was refurbished and opened as [[Goldsmiths CCA]].\n\nIn August 2019, Goldsmiths announced that it would be removing all beef products from sale and would be charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. The changes were introduced as part of the university's efforts to become carbon neutral by 2025.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-49321560|title=University bans hamburgers 'to help environment'|last=Sellgren|first=Katherine|date=2019-08-12|access-date=2019-08-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Campus and location==\n[[File:Deptford Town Hall Building.jpg|thumb|right|Deptford Town Hall Building]]\nGoldsmiths is situated in [[New Cross]], a highly populated area of south-east London with a considerable art and music scene. The area is served by [[London Overground]] trains at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nThe main building, the ''Richard Hoggart Building'', was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect [[John Shaw, Jr]] (1803\u20131870). The former Deptford Town Hall Building, designed by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Edwin Alfred Rickards]], acquired in 1998, is used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the [[RIBA]] award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the ''Ben Pimlott Building'' designed by [[Will Alsop]] and completed in 2005, and the ''Professor Stuart Hall Building'' (formerly the ''New Academic Building)'' which was completed in 2010.\n\nThe library, or the ''Rutherford Building'', has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. The third-floor library is believed to house the largest collection of audio-visual material in the UK. Goldsmiths' students, like all other students in the [[University of London]], have full access to the collections at [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] Library at [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.\n\n[[File:Goldsmiths Pimlott Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\nThe seven-storey ''Ben Pimlott Building'' on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive \"scribble in the sky\" (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths.

The Head of Department is Dr Richard Noble. Notable alumni include [[Damien Hirst]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]], [[Gillian Wearing]], [[Fiona Banner]], Sabina Goldsmith and [[Graham Coxon]].\n* The university is also a member of the [[Screen Studies Group, London]].\n\n====Design====\nThe Department of Design's approach to design practice grew from a concern for ethical and environmentalist design. This developed alongside research by [[John Wood (design theorist)|John Wood]], and others, which informs their research into [[metadesign]]. TERU, the Technology Education Research Unit, has been instrumental in understanding how design and technology work in schools, how to encourage learners towards creative interventions that improve the made world, and how to help teachers to support that process. The Writing Purposefully in Art and Design Network (Writing-PAD) has its main Centre at Goldsmiths. The Network now spans some 70 institutions across the art and design sector with 6 national and 2 International Writing PAD Centres.\n\n==== Sociology ====\nThe [[Sociology]] Department include [[Nirmal Puwar]], [https://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/staff/gunaratnam/ Yasmin Gunaratnam]  and [https://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/staff/bell/ Vikki Bell.]\n\n==== Cultural studies ====\nThe Media and Communications Department, as well as the Centre for Cultural Studies, include David Morley, [[Scott Lash]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Nirmal Puwar]] and (formerly) [[Sara Ahmed]].\n\n====Institute for Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship====\nThe Institute for Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship delivers entrepreneurship, cultural management and policy education to the creative and cultural sectors.\n\n====Anthropology====\nThe Department of Anthropology teaching staff include [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] and (formerly) [[David Graeber]].

It is a [[constituent college]] of the [[University of London]]. It was founded in 1891 as '''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute''' by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] in [[New Cross]], London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed '''Goldsmiths' College'''. The word ''College'' was dropped from its branding in 2006, but Goldsmiths' College, with the [[apostrophe]], remains the institution's formal legal name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |title=Rebranding FAQs |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |quote=it is now known as Goldsmiths, University of London.|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225110856/http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |archivedate = 25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nNearly 20% of students come from outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Goldsmiths Main Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Richard Hoggart]] Building]]\nIn 1891, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], one of the [[City of London]] [[Livery Companies]], founded ''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute'' (more commonly referred to simply as the \"Goldsmiths' Institute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=5499&inst_id=29 |title=Goldsmiths' College archives |publisher=Aim25.ac.uk |date=29 September 1905 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>). The Goldsmiths' Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to \"the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes\". The original Institute was based in New Cross at the former [[Royal Naval School]] building. (This building, which was designed by the architect [[John Shaw Jr]], is now known as the ''Richard Hoggart Building'' and remains the main building of the campus today.)\n\n[[File:From the Services To Schoolmastering- Re-training at Goldsmith's College, London University, Nottingham, England, 1944 D22754.jpg|thumbnail|left|Goldsmiths College students at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1944]]\nIn 1904, the Institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as '''Goldsmiths' College'''. (The apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word 'College' dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher's Certificate course. The College also ran its own Nursery School.\n\nShortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]], at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the College to [[University of Nottingham|University College, Nottingham]], a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an [[incendiary bomb]] and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947).\n\nDuring the 1960s Goldsmiths experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and [[social science]] fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former [[Deptford]] [[Town Hall]] and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain [[Grade II listed]] building status.\n\nIn 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the [[University of London]] and in 1990 received its [[Royal Charter]]. Among its [[List of Goldsmiths College people#List of Wardens of Goldsmiths|wardens]] have been [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Andrew Rutherford (English scholar)|Andrew Rutherford]] and [[Ben Pimlott]]. The current, and first woman, Warden is Francis Corner.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357165/Revealed-BBC-boss-landed-866k-payoff-walked-straight-public-sector-job.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Revealed: BBC boss who landed \u00a3866k payoff and walked straight into another public-sector job}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the former boiler house and public laundry of Laurie Grove Baths was refurbished and opened as [[Goldsmiths CCA]].\n\nIn August 2019, Goldsmiths announced that it would be removing all beef products from sale and would be charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. The changes were introduced as part of the university's efforts to become carbon neutral by 2025.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-49321560|title=University bans hamburgers 'to help environment'|last=Sellgren|first=Katherine|date=2019-08-12|access-date=2019-08-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Campus and location==\n[[File:Deptford Town Hall Building.jpg|thumb|right|Deptford Town Hall Building]]\nGoldsmiths is situated in [[New Cross]], a highly populated area of south-east London with a considerable art and music scene. The area is served by [[London Overground]] trains at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nThe main building, the ''Richard Hoggart Building'', was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect [[John Shaw, Jr]] (1803\u20131870). The former Deptford Town Hall Building, designed by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Edwin Alfred Rickards]], acquired in 1998, is used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the [[RIBA]] award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the ''Ben Pimlott Building'' designed by [[Will Alsop]] and completed in 2005, and the ''Professor Stuart Hall Building'' (formerly the ''New Academic Building)'' which was completed in 2010.\n\nThe library, or the ''Rutherford Building'', has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. The third-floor library is believed to house the largest collection of audio-visual material in the UK. Goldsmiths' students, like all other students in the [[University of London]], have full access to the collections at [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] Library at [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.\n\n[[File:Goldsmiths Pimlott Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\nThe seven-storey ''Ben Pimlott Building'' on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive \"scribble in the sky\" (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths.
