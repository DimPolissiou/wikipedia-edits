Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

and [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 13 October to 25 November 1965. Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926, in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

Yet, as to what kind of vegetation \"badas\" is, is a subject of conjecture. Some believed that it was a kind of bamboo, now called \"bagacay\".  Others believed it to be some sturdy tree, but the majority believed that it is a wild rattan plant abounding in the surrounding mountains.  Nevertheless, one common belief is the fact that this \"badas\" was a source of materials for making spears, a weapon used by the native to repel the raiders and pirates.\n\nIt is also believed that \"badas\" was a much in-demand material for building the native huts.  Because of its abundance in the area, villagers called the place \"Cabadasan\"\n\n==Geography==\nThe Municipality of Baras is one of the eleven municipalities of the island Province of Catanduanes within the Region-V ([[Bicol Region]]).

Some elders recall that Baras, centuries back was once a progressive fishing village located over a small mountain projecting towards the sea on the western side of Baras Bay. The poblacion was its cemetery and the cemetery now was its former poblacion site. The old site was chosen because it was an elevated area overlooking the sea.\n\nThe villagers could easily see approaching pirates that occasionally plundered the sea, giving them ample time to evacuate their families and prepare for the encounter.  Several Skirmishes had been taught in the present poblacion.\n\nExcavation in the Church Plaza reveals human remains of evaders.  The pirates gone, the villagers later settled in what are now Baras.  A splintered group of insurrecturs headed by a certain CATALINO CATAKUTAN who was facing the advantage of the insurrection taking place in the Southern Tagalog region, braved the rough seas to set a place in the long quest for Philippine Independence in the Island, forced by the gusty Southeast Monsoon wind they finally set anchor in the once rich fishing village called \"Cabadasan\" posing as fisherman.\n\nBy befriending the villagers and at the same time working on the growing discontent among the people against the tyrannical rule of Capitan CARLOS MACAPUGAY who was then Bat\u2019s town executive, the rebel grouped the men folk of the village to form a fierce fighting bond.\n\nOut of this uprising led by Catalino Catakutan, the umbilical cord through which Cabadasan ruled was detached and the town of Baras was born.\n\nMarried to Maria Timola from Bato, Capitan Catalino Catakutan, with the burning desire for independence, did not live long to set office in the entire province.  The Spaniards caught up with him while attending a wedding feast.  Tortured and chained by the neck, he was paraded around the Poblacion of Bato to serve as warning to the people.\n\nHe was hanged near the church of Bato.  In his stead, Capitan Mariano Teologo was installed as Bara\u2019s first town executive on May 11, 1897.  Its original barrios were Tilod, Macutal, Paniquihan and Gigmoto.\n\n===Baras - A Town and then a Barrio===\n\nBaras was founded as a town on May 11, 1897, and Capitan Mariano Teologo served as its first town executive until the end of 1897. To minister to the town\u2019s spiritual needs was Pablo Zuniega, Baras' first parish priest, whose tenure ended in the middle of 1904.\n\nThe early year of Baras as a town was a period of difficult adjustment.  In 1905, Capitan Quirico Arcilla, the town\u2019s fourth executive, started the construction of a semi-permanent municipal building called \"TRIBUNAL\".  A dynamic and a dominant figure in Baras politics, his centering effort in the administration of local affairs was well as his proven integrity, he enabled the town to experience a period of prosperity.  In 1906, Capitan Alvaro Vergara succeeded him.  In 1907 due to financial difficulties the town was reverted to a barrio status.  A few days later after its reversion into a barrio of Bato, its executive appointed Reymundo Tanael as Cabeza (barrio executive). Baras existed as a barrio up to the last days of 1909.\n\nIn a period of 3 years as a barrio, cabezas ruled it, namely: Cabeza Raymundo Tanael, Agustin Tanael, Felix Teologo, Lucas Arcilla and Catalino Guerrero.  Before the end of the year 1909, civic, religious and business leaders of Baras demanded from the ruling governing power that it be re-created back into a municipality.\n\nAnd, in 1910, Baras reverted into a town for the second time.  Its first executive who was then called by the title of presidente municipal was Quirico Arcilla. Quirico Arcilla was succeeded by Alvaro Vergara in 1912.  In 1914, appointed to steer the reigns of government was Capitan Juan Pablo, a Tagalog immigrant who found a local belle for his life partner. In the election of 1915, he lost to Pedro Vergara, only to be elected again in 1918. From then, Baras moved on experiencing the test of time as a municipality. In 1927 Flaviano Camu, then constructed Camu Street connecting it to San Lorenzo Street. In 1929 the present sight of barrio Putsan was constructed.\n\nIn May 1933, the Bato-Baras road was opened to traffic. In 1935 the gold boom reached Baras, an American firm headed by a certain Mr. Torchand dug sitio Banog in Agban and started the gold mines in Agban, at the same time the abaca and copra industries, for which Baras had been famous, were at their peak.  For some unknown reasons the firm had to close shop at the end of 1938.\n\nOn 10 December 1941, or one year after typhoon \"Oguis\", a Japanese fleet, consisting of an aircraft carrier and a destroyer, landed at Batalay in Bato, swooped down on Barrio Guinsaanan in Baras, releasing three medium-sized bombs hitting Sayao rock off the coast of Guinsaanan, making Baras a ghost town overnight.\n\nAfter a month with no governing officials reporting to their office, the incumbent Mayor Victor Tanael returned from hiding and normalcy returned once again.  Other municipal officials reported to their offices. In the early part of 1943, Mayor Tanael died of sickness and so, the Japanese occupation government appointed Mr. Dionisio Tolledo as Mayor, Atty. Severiano de Leon as Municipal Judge, Mr. Pedro Teston as Chief of Police, Mr. Reynato Magistrado and Jaime Templonuevo as Policemen. They were the only officials appointed.\n\nIn the early morning of February 1944, the town folks were surprised by rain of bullets. Major Salvador Rodulfo aka \"PHANTOM\" of Barangay Tilod, Baras, fresh from his guerilla exploits in Albay, landed at Tilod with soldiers and started organizing independent guerilla outfit, later to be known as the Catanduanes Liberators Battalion. Baras became the sanctuary of the  resistance movement in the province.\n\nIt was his group who was responsible for the annihilation of all Japanese soldiers in the island, killing most of them and capturing the remaining that were caught alive and raising to the ground their garrisons and hideouts.\n\nImmediately after the liberation of the country from the Japanese warriors in 1945, President Osme\u00f1a appointed some Municipal Heads of the town.\n\nIn 1951, the barrios of San Vicente, Gigmoto, Biong and Dororian were transferred to then newly created town of [[Gigmoto, Catanduanes|Gigmoto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra614.html|title=An act creating the municipality of Gigmoto in the province of Catanduanes|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>\n\nUnder the administration of Mayor Chito Chi,Baras town has just received a Certificate of Recognition for ranking number one in the collection of business taxes among the 5th income class municipalities in the entire Bicol Region that exceeded the target amount. Mayor Chito Chi was defeated by Rodel V. Abichuela, a lawyer by profession, in the elections of 2013.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Baras\n| 1903 = 2777\n| 1918 = 6244\n| 1939 = 10328\n| 1948 = 10275\n| 1960 = 9637\n| 1970 = 9918\n| 1975 = 10338\n| 1980 = 10273\n| 1990 = 9769\n| 1995 = 11843\n| 2000 = 11653\n| 2007 = 11787\n| 2010 = 12243\n| 2015 = 12848\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Baras, Catanduanes, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==List of former Chief Executives==\n\n=== As a Town ===\nCapitan Mariano Teologo ................... 1897-1898<br />\nCapitan Vicente Guerrero................... 1899-1900<br />\nCapitan Jose Patrocinio Rodulfo..........1901-1903<br />\nCapitan Quirico Arcilla .........................1904-1905<br />\nCapitan Alvaro Vergara ...................... 1906\n\n===As a Barrio (Reverted)===\nCabeza Raymundo Tanael ..................

Yet, as to what kind of vegetation \"badas\" is, is a subject of conjecture. Some believed that it was a kind of bamboo, now called \"bagacay\".  Others believed it to be some sturdy tree, but the majority believed that it is a wild rattan plant abounding in the surrounding mountains.  Nevertheless, one common belief is the fact that this \"badas\" was a source of materials for making spears, a weapon used by the native to repel the raiders and pirates.\n\nIt is also believed that \"badas\" was a much in-demand material for building the native huts.  Because of its abundance in the area, villagers called the place \"Cabadasan\"\n\n==Geography==\nThe Municipality of Baras is one of the eleven municipalities of the island Province of Catanduanes within the Region-V ([[Bicol Region]]).

Some elders recall that Baras, centuries back was once a progressive fishing village located over a small mountain projecting towards the sea on the western side of Baras Bay. The poblacion was its cemetery and the cemetery now was its former poblacion site. The old site was chosen because it was an elevated area overlooking the sea.\n\nThe villagers could easily see approaching pirates that occasionally plundered the sea, giving them ample time to evacuate their families and prepare for the encounter.  Several Skirmishes had been taught in the present poblacion.\n\nExcavation in the Church Plaza reveals human remains of evaders.  The pirates gone, the villagers later settled in what are now Baras.  A splintered group of insurrecturs headed by a certain CATALINO CATAKUTAN who was facing the advantage of the insurrection taking place in the Southern Tagalog region, braved the rough seas to set a place in the long quest for Philippine Independence in the Island, forced by the gusty Southeast Monsoon wind they finally set anchor in the once rich fishing village called \"Cabadasan\" posing as fisherman.\n\nBy befriending the villagers and at the same time working on the growing discontent among the people against the tyrannical rule of Capitan CARLOS MACAPUGAY who was then Bat\u2019s town executive, the rebel grouped the men folk of the village to form a fierce fighting bond.\n\nOut of this uprising led by Catalino Catakutan, the umbilical cord through which Cabadasan ruled was detached and the town of Baras was born.\n\nMarried to Maria Timola from Bato, Capitan Catalino Catakutan, with the burning desire for independence, did not live long to set office in the entire province.  The Spaniards caught up with him while attending a wedding feast.  Tortured and chained by the neck, he was paraded around the Poblacion of Bato to serve as warning to the people.\n\nHe was hanged near the church of Bato.  In his stead, Capitan Mariano Teologo was installed as Bara\u2019s first town executive on May 11, 1897.  Its original barrios were Tilod, Macutal, Paniquihan and Gigmoto.\n\n===Baras - A Town and then a Barrio===\n\nBaras was founded as a town on May 11, 1897, and Capitan Mariano Teologo served as its first town executive until the end of 1897. To minister to the town\u2019s spiritual needs was Pablo Zuniega, Baras' first parish priest, whose tenure ended in the middle of 1904.\n\nThe early year of Baras as a town was a period of difficult adjustment.  In 1905, Capitan Quirico Arcilla, the town\u2019s fourth executive, started the construction of a semi-permanent municipal building called \"TRIBUNAL\".  A dynamic and a dominant figure in Baras politics, his centering effort in the administration of local affairs was well as his proven integrity, he enabled the town to experience a period of prosperity.  In 1906, Capitan Alvaro Vergara succeeded him.  In 1907 due to financial difficulties the town was reverted to a barrio status.  A few days later after its reversion into a barrio of Bato, its executive appointed Reymundo Tanael as Cabeza (barrio executive). Baras existed as a barrio up to the last days of 1909.\n\nIn a period of 3 years as a barrio, cabezas ruled it, namely: Cabeza Raymundo Tanael, Agustin Tanael, Felix Teologo, Lucas Arcilla and Catalino Guerrero.  Before the end of the year 1909, civic, religious and business leaders of Baras demanded from the ruling governing power that it be re-created back into a municipality.\n\nAnd, in 1910, Baras reverted into a town for the second time.  Its first executive who was then called by the title of presidente municipal was Quirico Arcilla. Quirico Arcilla was succeeded by Alvaro Vergara in 1912.  In 1914, appointed to steer the reigns of government was Capitan Juan Pablo, a Tagalog immigrant who found a local belle for his life partner. In the election of 1915, he lost to Pedro Vergara, only to be elected again in 1918. From then, Baras moved on experiencing the test of time as a municipality. In 1927 Flaviano Camu, then constructed Camu Street connecting it to San Lorenzo Street. In 1929 the present sight of barrio Putsan was constructed.\n\nIn May 1933, the Bato-Baras road was opened to traffic. In 1935 the gold boom reached Baras, an American firm headed by a certain Mr. Torchand dug sitio Banog in Agban and started the gold mines in Agban, at the same time the abaca and copra industries, for which Baras had been famous, were at their peak.  For some unknown reasons the firm had to close shop at the end of 1938.\n\nOn 10 December 1941, or one year after typhoon \"Oguis\", a Japanese fleet, consisting of an aircraft carrier and a destroyer, landed at Batalay in Bato, swooped down on Barrio Guinsaanan in Baras, releasing three medium-sized bombs hitting Sayao rock off the coast of Guinsaanan, making Baras a ghost town overnight.\n\nAfter a month with no governing officials reporting to their office, the incumbent Mayor Victor Tanael returned from hiding and normalcy returned once again.  Other municipal officials reported to their offices. In the early part of 1943, Mayor Tanael died of sickness and so, the Japanese occupation government appointed Mr. Dionisio Tolledo as Mayor, Atty. Severiano de Leon as Municipal Judge, Mr. Pedro Teston as Chief of Police, Mr. Reynato Magistrado and Jaime Templonuevo as Policemen. They were the only officials appointed.\n\nIn the early morning of February 1944, the town folks were surprised by rain of bullets. Major Salvador Rodulfo aka \"PHANTOM\" of Barangay Tilod, Baras, fresh from his guerilla exploits in Albay, landed at Tilod with soldiers and started organizing independent guerilla outfit, later to be known as the Catanduanes Liberators Battalion. Baras became the sanctuary of the  resistance movement in the province.\n\nIt was his group who was responsible for the annihilation of all Japanese soldiers in the island, killing most of them and capturing the remaining that were caught alive and raising to the ground their garrisons and hideouts.\n\nImmediately after the liberation of the country from the Japanese warriors in 1945, President Osme\u00f1a appointed some Municipal Heads of the town.\n\nIn 1951, the barrios of San Vicente, Gigmoto, Biong and Dororian were transferred to then newly created town of [[Gigmoto, Catanduanes|Gigmoto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra614.html|title=An act creating the municipality of Gigmoto in the province of Catanduanes|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>\n\nUnder the administration of Mayor Chito Chi,Baras town has just received a Certificate of Recognition for ranking number one in the collection of business taxes among the 5th income class municipalities in the entire Bicol Region that exceeded the target amount. Mayor Chito Chi was defeated by Rodel V. Abichuela, a lawyer by profession, in the elections of 2013.\n\n==List of former Chief Executives==\n\n=== As a Town ===\nCapitan Mariano Teologo ................... 1897-1898<br />\nCapitan Vicente Guerrero................... 1899-1900<br />\nCapitan Jose Patrocinio Rodulfo..........1901-1903<br />\nCapitan Quirico Arcilla .........................1904-1905<br />\nCapitan Alvaro Vergara ...................... 1906\n\n===As a Barrio (Reverted)===\nCabeza Raymundo Tanael ..................

He is known for inventing new surgical techniques for treatment of various ophthalmological disorders, and received professional awards for his contributions.\n\n== Career ==\nArnott was educated at [[Harrow School]] (Elmfield) and [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where he was awarded the Surgical Prize in 1952; BA (Hons) 1953 and MB (Hons), BCh (Hons) and BAO (Hons) 1954. He gained his Diploma in Ophthalmology (DO) in 1956 and Fellowship to the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] (FRCS) in 1963.\n\nArnott's first ophthalmic appointment was as Houseman at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] and [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]], Dublin, following which he held early appointments at [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], London, and [[University College Hospital|University College Hospital London]], where he trained under [[Stewart Duke-Elder|Sir Stewart Duke-Elder]] and [[H. B. Stallard]].\n\nWhilst at Moorfields he worked with [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Sir Harold Ridley]], the inventor of the intraocular lens; Arnott was inspired by Ridley\u2019s work on the [[intraocular lens]] and they later became lifelong friends.\n\nAfter completing training at [[University College Hospital]], Arnott was appointed as consultant initially to the Royal Eye Hospital and later, in 1965, to [[Charing Cross Hospital]]; then still in the Strand. In 1973 the hospital moved to its current site in [[Fulham]], where Arnott was responsible for setting up the ophthalmic surgical services.\n\nIn 1974, Arnott and his wife Veronica organised the first Live International Ophthalmic Micro-Surgical Symposium in Charing Cross Hospital, where ten of the world\u2019s top eye surgeons performed live surgery, relayed to over 300 international delegates, courtesy of the [[BBC]]. This novel concept in advanced surgical teaching set a standard for future surgical conferences. He later organised two other live symposia with Professor Emanuel Rosen, with the objective of bringing new ideas in [[cataract]] surgery to a wider audience.\n\nArnott was known for his pioneering work in ophthalmology and many of today\u2019s top eye surgeons were trained by him whilst registrars at Charing Cross.\n\nHe retired from the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in 1994.\n\n== Phacoemulsification ==\nIn 1968, whilst Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom he invited Dr [[Charles Kelman]] MD, the inventor of [[phacoemulsification]] (\"phaco\"), to address the Society. Kelman had found a method of removing the [[cataract]] through an incision of 3.5mm compared to the 12mm required for most surgery at the time. This meant that patients no longer had to remain in bed for two weeks after surgery with all movement restricted.\n\nIn 1971, Arnott visited the United States to attend one of Kelman\u2019s first courses. On his return, he privately raised the finance to buy the expensive equipment required for the procedure. When he started performing this new type of cataract operation, history indicates that it was not well received by his colleagues. Six years later Arnott was virtually alone in performing and teaching this procedure outside America.\n\nToday, almost all cataract surgery is carried out using a variation of the technique that Arnott pioneered in the UK in the early seventies.\n\n== Lens implantation ==\nIn 1974, influenced by Sir [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Harold Ridley]]'s work on lens implantation, Arnott designed the Little-Arnott lens, which was manufactured by [[Rayner (company)|Rayners]]. This was one of the first intraocular lenses to be positioned behind the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], the normal position of the natural lens. Previously, lenses were implanted in front of the iris, and many of them caused severe ocular problems.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\">Apple D.J., Kincaid M.C., Mamalis N, Olson R.J.  Intraocular Lenses: Evolution, Designs, Complications, and Pathology. Baltimore, Williams & Wilkins (1989)</ref> Arnott followed this up with several other designs before inventing \"the totally encircling loop\" lens <ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> which was manufactured under license by [[Alcon]], Pharmacia and [[Smith & Nephew]] and others. Clinical data demonstrated that this lens maintained an excellent position within the eye and over 2 million were implanted worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Arnott E.J. Condon R. TELL - 3 year follow up of 1800 cases from Aug 1982 - Aug 1985. Cataract Journal Vol. 2 No. 8</ref>\n\nDuring the seventies, all of the lenses designed by Arnott were made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA). In 1981, Arnott and Richard Packard, his then senior registrar at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], were the first to describe the use of a soft lens material, which could be folded to go through a small incision.<ref>Arnott E.J., Packard R.B.S., & Garner A. Poly-Hema as a material for intraocular lens implantation - a preliminary report. B.J.O. 65. (1981)</ref> In 1988 Arnott was the first surgeon to insert a bi-focal lens implant in Europe.\n\nFollowing cataract removal, it used to be common for patients to require thick pebble glasses to be able to see. Nowadays, virtually all patients receive a lens implant following [[cataract]] surgery, avoiding the need for glasses.\n\n== Other contributions==\nArnott was also responsible for introducing other surgical techniques.\n\nIn 1966 he was amongst the first surgeons in the world to follow Dermot Pearce\u2019s use of the surgical microscope.<ref>1978 Nursing Mirror Nov. 30-34 E J Arnott & M C W Treplin; Surgical use of the microscope in ophthalmics</ref>\n\nIn 1967 he and Paddy Condon, his then senior registrar, used the first silicone implant for [[retinal detachment]] surgery.\n\nIn 1968 he modified the final approach to [[glaucoma]] surgery by making the opening into the anterior chamber through the clear [[cornea]], as opposed to the previous dialysis approach.\n\nIn 1976 he and Jared Emery of [[Houston]], Texas, invented the diamond tipped \"spear headed\" surgical knife for making the phaco incision and in 1978 he was the first surgeon to perform a combined phaco cataract and glaucoma operation.\n\nArnott was very early in recognising the new trend of laser refractive surgery to correct [[myopia]] (shortsightedness). He acquired one of the first [[excimer laser]]s, which he located in [[Cromwell Hospital]] in 1991, where his private practice was based. In 1992 he was the first person in the UK to perform [[LASIK]].<ref>Scotland on Sunday (13 December 1992), The Times, Guardian, Daily Mail and The Sun (13 December 1992)</ref>\n\nIn 2000 Arnott received an award from the [[The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC)|International Intra-Ocular Implant Club]] - the IIIC Medal, at the Club's annual autumn meeting in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n== Charity work ==\n\nIn 1982 he reduced his work in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] (from maximum part-time) to four sessions a week and began concentrating on charitable work at the Royal Masonic Hospital, London, (where he remained an honouree consultant until 1994) and international teaching commitments.\n\nOver the course of his career, Arnott lectured and performed live surgery throughout the world, paying particular attention to the Asian and African continents where cataracts are most prevalent.\n\nIn 1984 he was one of the first surgeons to demonstrate phaco surgery and lens implantation in [[India]] and in 1991 he received a special award from the Asian branch of the [[Royal National Institute for the Blind]] for \"outstanding support\" to blind Asians in [[London]] and [[India]]. The same award was presented a year later to his son Stephen,<ref name=\"peeraage\" /> who managed Arnott's private practice. In 1996, Arnott was invited to officially open the first meeting of the Indian Academy of Ophthalmology, and in 1998 he was made an honorary visiting Professor at Indore University.\n\nAfter Arnott's retirement in 1999, with the help of his wife Veronica<ref name=\"peeraage\">{{cite web |url=http://thepeerage.com/p12568.htm#i125672 |title=Professor Eric John Arnott |work=The Peerage |date=8 December 2011 }}</ref> and son Stephen, he raised funds to fund and equip a mobile operating theatre to perform modern eye surgery in remote Indian villages. This project was undertaken in conjunction with the Sathya Sai Institute.<ref>Ocular Surgery News \u2013 15 October 1999</ref>\n\nAlong with Dr G Chandra, he established the charity organisation 'Balrampur Hospital Foundation UK' in 2007 and served as a Trustee and its President.\n\n== Medical societies ==\nArnott was a member of many international ophthalmic societies and was the founder President of the European Society for Phaco and Laser Surgery (1986\u201389), Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom (1967 \u2013 1968), President of the Chelsea Clinical Society (1985) and President of the International Association of Ocular Surgeons (1983).\n\nHe was also one of the original founder members of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.\n\nIn 2007 Arnott received the Honoured Guest award from the ASCRS for his services to ophthalmology.<ref>[http://www.ascrs.org/ascrs-honored-guest-award American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS)]</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nHe wrote over 40 published scientific articles for British and foreign ophthalmic journals on strabismus surgery, congenital abnormalities, cataract extraction, Phaco-emulsification and intra-ocular lenses.<ref>Publications\n\u2022\t1964 B.J.O.

He is known for inventing new surgical techniques for treatment of various ophthalmological disorders, and received professional awards for his contributions.\n\n== Career ==\nArnott was educated at [[Harrow School]] (Elmfield) and [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where he was awarded the Surgical Prize in 1952; BA (Hons) 1953 and MB (Hons), BCh(Hons)and BAO (Hons)1954. He gained his Diploma in Ophthalmology (DO) in 1956 and Fellowship to the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] (FRCS) in 1963.\n\nArnott's first ophthalmic appointment was as Houseman at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] and [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]], Dublin, following which he held early appointments at [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], London, and [[University College Hospital|University College Hospital London]], where he trained under [[Stewart Duke-Elder|Sir Stewart Duke-Elder]] and [[H. B. Stallard]].\n\nWhilst at Moorfields he worked with [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Sir Harold Ridley]], the inventor of the intraocular lens; Arnott was inspired by Ridley\u2019s work on the [[intraocular lens]] and they later became lifelong friends.\n\nAfter completing training at [[University College Hospital]], Arnott was appointed as consultant initially to the Royal Eye Hospital and later, in 1965, to [[Charing Cross Hospital]]; then still in the Strand. In 1973 the hospital moved to its current site in [[Fulham]], where Arnott was responsible for setting up the ophthalmic surgical services.\n\nIn 1974, Arnott and his wife Veronica organised the first Live International Ophthalmic Micro-Surgical Symposium in Charing Cross Hospital, where ten of the world\u2019s top eye surgeons performed live surgery, relayed to over 300 international delegates, courtesy of the [[BBC]]. This novel concept in advanced surgical teaching set a standard for future surgical conferences. He later organised two other live symposia with Professor Emanuel Rosen, with the objective of bringing new ideas in [[cataract]] surgery to a wider audience.\n\nArnott was known for his pioneering work in ophthalmology and many of today\u2019s top eye surgeons were trained by him whilst registrars at Charing Cross.\n\nHe retired from the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in 1994.\n\n== Phacoemulsification ==\nIn 1968, whilst Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom he invited Dr [[Charles Kelman]] MD, the inventor of [[phacoemulsification]] (\"phaco\"), to address the Society. Kelman had found a method of removing the [[cataract]] through an incision of 3.5mm compared to the 12mm required for most surgery at the time. This meant that patients no longer had to remain in bed for two weeks after surgery with all movement restricted.\n\nIn 1971, Arnott visited the United States to attend one of Kelman\u2019s first courses. On his return, he privately raised the finance to buy the expensive equipment required for the procedure. When he started performing this new type of cataract operation, history indicates that it was not well received by his colleagues. Six years later Arnott was virtually alone in performing and teaching this procedure outside America.\n\nToday, almost all cataract surgery is carried out using a variation of the technique that Arnott pioneered in the UK in the early seventies.\n\n== Lens implantation ==\nIn 1974, influenced by Sir [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Harold Ridley]]'s work on lens implantation, Arnott designed the Little-Arnott lens, which was manufactured by [[Rayner (company)|Rayners]]. This was one of the first intraocular lenses to be positioned behind the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], the normal position of the natural lens. Previously, lenses were implanted in front of the iris, and many of them caused severe ocular problems.<ref name=\"autogenerated1989\">Apple D.J., Kincaid M.C., Mamalis N, Olson R.J.  Intraocular Lenses: Evolution, Designs, Complications, and Pathology. Baltimore, Williams & Wilkins (1989)</ref> Arnott followed this up with several other designs before inventing \"the totally encircling loop\" lens <ref name=\"autogenerated1989\"/> which was manufactured under license by [[Alcon]], Pharmacia and [[Smith & Nephew]] and others. Clinical data demonstrated that this lens maintained an excellent position within the eye and over 2 million were implanted worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Arnott E.J. Condon R. TELL - 3 year follow up of 1800 cases from Aug 1982 - Aug 1985. Cataract Journal Vol. 2 No. 8</ref>\n\nDuring the seventies, all of the lenses designed by Arnott were made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA). In 1981, Arnott and Richard Packard, his then senior registrar at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], were the first to describe the use of a soft lens material, which could be folded to go through a small incision.<ref>Arnott E.J., Packard R.B.S., & Garner A. Poly-Hema as a material for intraocular lens implantation - a preliminary report. B.J.O. 65. (1981)</ref> In 1988 Arnott was the first surgeon to insert a bi-focal lens implant in Europe.\n\nFollowing cataract removal, it used to be common for patients to require thick pebble glasses to be able to see. Nowadays, virtually all patients receive a lens implant following [[cataract]] surgery, avoiding the need for glasses.\n\n== Other contributions==\nArnott was also responsible for introducing other surgical techniques.\n\nIn 1966 he was amongst the first surgeons in the world to follow Dermot Pearce\u2019s use of the surgical microscope.<ref>1978 Nursing Mirror Nov. 30-34 E J Arnott & M C W Treplin; Surgical use of the microscope in ophthalmics</ref>\n\nIn 1967 he and Paddy Condon, his then senior registrar, used the first silicone implant for [[retinal detachment]] surgery.\n\nIn 1968 he modified the final approach to [[glaucoma]] surgery by making the opening into the anterior chamber through the clear [[cornea]], as opposed to the previous dialysis approach.\n\nIn 1976 he and Jared Emery of [[Houston]], Texas, invented the diamond tipped \"spear headed\" surgical knife for making the phaco incision and in 1978 he was the first surgeon to perform a combined phaco cataract and glaucoma operation.\n\nArnott was very early in recognising the new trend of laser refractive surgery to correct [[myopia]] (shortsightedness). He acquired one of the first [[excimer laser]]s, which he located in [[Cromwell Hospital]] in 1991, where his private practice was based. In 1992 he was the first person in the UK to perform [[LASIK]].<ref>Scotland on Sunday (13 December 1992), The Times, Guardian, Daily Mail and The Sun (13 December 1992)</ref>\n\nIn 2000 Arnott received an award from the [[The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC)|International Intra-Ocular Implant Club]] - the IIIC Medal, at the Club's annual autumn meeting in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n== Charity work ==\n\nIn 1982 he reduced his work in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] (from maximum part-time) to four sessions a week and began concentrating on charitable work at the Royal Masonic Hospital, London, (where he remained an honouree consultant until 1994) and international teaching commitments.\n\nOver the course of his career, Arnott lectured and performed live surgery throughout the world, paying particular attention to the Asian and African continents where cataracts are most prevalent.\n\nIn 1984 he was one of the first surgeons to demonstrate phaco surgery and lens implantation in [[India]] and in 1991 he received a special award from the Asian branch of the [[Royal National Institute for the Blind]] for \"outstanding support\" to blind Asians in [[London]] and [[India]]. The same award was presented a year later to his son Stephen,<ref name=\"peeraage\" /> who managed Arnott's private practice. In 1996, Arnott was invited to officially open the first meeting of the Indian Academy of Ophthalmology, and in 1998 he was made an honorary visiting Professor at Indore University.\n\nAfter Arnott's retirement in 1999, with the help of his wife Veronica<ref name=\"peeraage\">{{cite web |url=http://thepeerage.com/p12568.htm#i125672 |title=Professor Eric John Arnott |work=The Peerage |date=8 December 2011 }}</ref> and son Stephen, he raised funds to fund and equip a mobile operating theatre to perform modern eye surgery in remote Indian villages. This project was undertaken in conjunction with the Sathya Sai Institute.<ref>Ocular Surgery News \u2013 15 October 1999</ref>\n\nAlong with Dr G Chandra, he established the charity organisation 'Balrampur Hospital Foundation UK' in 2007 and served as a Trustee and its President.\n\n== Medical societies ==\nArnott was a member of many international ophthalmic societies and was the founder President of the European Society for Phaco and Laser Surgery (1986\u201389), Secretary of the Ophthalmic Society of the United Kingdom (1967 \u2013 1968), President of the Chelsea Clinical Society (1985) and President of the International Association of Ocular Surgeons (1983).\n\nHe was also one of the original founder members of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.\n\nIn 2007 Arnott received the Honoured Guest award from the ASCRS for his services to ophthalmology.<ref>[http://www.ascrs.org/ascrs-honored-guest-award American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS)]</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nHe wrote over 40 published scientific articles for British and foreign ophthalmic journals on strabismus surgery, congenital abnormalities, cataract extraction, Phaco-emulsification and intra-ocular lenses.<ref>Publications\n\u2022\t1964 B.J.O.

On either side of the word are blue outlines of flames.|The logo of the ''Bleach'' series as seen on all of the video game covers]]There are several [[video game]]s based on [[Tite Kubo]]'s manga and anime series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]''. The titles consist mostly of [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Fighting game|fighters]], but also include other genres such as [[Tactical role-playing game|strategy role-playing games]] and [[action role-playing game]]s. Most of the games retell the [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|plot]] of the manga, following [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and [[List of Bleach characters|his friends]]. Some games, however, have veered from the source material and incorporated original stories and characters. The games have been released on a variety of [[video game console|home]] and [[handheld game console|handheld consoles]].\n\nThe first game to be released based on the ''Bleach'' series was ''[[Bleach: Heat the Soul (series)#Bleach: Heat the Soul|Bleach: Heat the Soul]]'', which debuted on March 24, 2005, and the latest releases are ''[[Bleach: Soul Resurrecci\u00f3n]]'', which was released in North America on August 2, 2011 and ''Bleach: Bankai Batoru'', a [[Social network game|social network]] game which was released in Japan on April 14, 2014.<ref name=\"HTSRelease\"/><ref name=\"Ignition\"/><ref name=\"Bankai Battle\"/> There are 23 games bearing the \"''Bleach''\" name, not including the four [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] games\u2014''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', ''[[J-Stars Victory VS]]'' and ''[[Jump Force]]''\u2014which feature characters from numerous other ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' anime and manga series. Most ''Bleach'' games have been released only in Japan, though [[Sega]] has localized the first [[Wii]] game and the first three [[Nintendo DS]] games for North America, Australia, and Europe. Reception toward the games has been mixed, ranging from \"the best fighter\" for ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate]]'', to \"(not) a bad first effort, but the competition is leaving this one in the dust\" for ''[[Bleach: Shattered Blade]]''.<ref name=\"FateReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/09/bleach-the-blade-of-fate-review|title=IGN: ''Bleach: The Blade of Fate Review''|author=Bozon|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"BladeReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/23/bleach-shattered-blade-review|title=IGN: ''Bleach: Shattered Blade Review''|author=Bozon|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 23, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Series==\n\n===''Bleach: Blade Battlers''===\n{{main|Bleach: Blade Battlers (series)}}\nThe {{Nihongo|''Bleach: Blade Battlers''|Bleach\u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c}} series is a series of [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] [[fighting game]]s developed by [[Racjin]] and published by [[SCEI]].\n{{Video game titles|\n{{Video game titles/item\n|title=Bleach: Blade Battlers\n|date={{vgrelease|JP|October 12, 2006}}\n|refs=<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps15116.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n|release=2006\u2014[[PlayStation 2]]<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\"/>\n|notes=* Features 4-player versus mode<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\"/>\n* Released under ''[[The Best (PlayStation range)|The Best]]'' label on October 25, 2007 in Japan<ref name=\"BladeBattlersRR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps19329.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c PlayStation\u00ae2 the Best|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Video game titles/item\n|title=Bleach: Blade Battlers 2nd\n|date={{vgrelease|JP|September 27, 2007}}\n|refs=<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps15119.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba2nd\u301c|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n|release=2007\u2014PlayStation 2<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2\"/>\n|notes=* Features 36 playable characters<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2PixFans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pixfans.com/analisis-de-bleach-blade-battlers-2nd/|author=Amorin Uzuki|title=An\u00e1lisis de Bleach Blade Battlers 2nd|date=October 4, 2007|publisher=pixfans.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n* The game features 4-player cooperative and versus modes<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2PixFans\"/>\n}}\n}}\n\n===''Bleach DS''===\nThe ''Bleach DS'' series are [[2D computer graphics|2-D]] games.

On either side of the word are blue outlines of flames.|The logo of the ''Bleach'' series as seen on all of the video game covers]]There are several [[video game]]s based on [[Tite Kubo]]'s manga and anime series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]''. The titles consist mostly of [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Fighting game|fighters]], but also include other genres such as [[Tactical role-playing game|strategy role-playing games]] and [[action role-playing game]]s. Most of the games retell the [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|plot]] of the manga, following [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and [[List of Bleach characters|his friends]]. Some games, however, have veered from the source material and incorporated original stories and characters. The games have been released on a variety of [[video game console|home]] and [[handheld game console|handheld consoles]].\n\nThe first game to be released based on the ''Bleach'' series was ''[[Bleach: Heat the Soul (series)#Bleach: Heat the Soul|Bleach: Heat the Soul]]'', which debuted on March 24, 2005, and the latest releases are ''[[Bleach: Soul Resurrecci\u00f3n]]'', which was released in North America on August 2, 2011 and ''Bleach: Bankai Batoru'', a [[Social network game|social network]] game which was released in Japan on April 14, 2014.<ref name=\"HTSRelease\"/><ref name=\"Ignition\"/><ref name=\"Bankai Battle\"/> There are 23 games bearing the \"''Bleach''\" name, not including the four [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] games\u2014''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', ''[[J-Stars Victory VS]]'' and ''[[Jump Force]]''\u2014which feature characters from numerous other ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' anime and manga series. Most ''Bleach'' games have been released only in Japan, though [[Sega]] has localized the first [[Wii]] game and the first three [[Nintendo DS]] games for North America, Australia, and Europe. Reception toward the games has been mixed, ranging from \"the best fighter\" for ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate]]'', to \"(not) a bad first effort, but the competition is leaving this one in the dust\" for ''[[Bleach: Shattered Blade]]''.<ref name=\"FateReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/09/bleach-the-blade-of-fate-review|title=IGN: ''Bleach: The Blade of Fate Review''|author=Bozon|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"BladeReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/23/bleach-shattered-blade-review|title=IGN: ''Bleach: Shattered Blade Review''|author=Bozon|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 23, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Series==\n\n===''Bleach: Blade Battlers''===\n{{main|Bleach: Blade Battlers (series)}}\nThe {{Nihongo|''Bleach: Blade Battlers''|Bleach\u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c}} series is a series of [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] [[fighting game]]s developed by [[Racjin]] and published by [[SCEI]].\n{{Video game titles|\n{{Video game titles/item\n|title=Bleach: Blade Battlers\n|date={{vgrelease|JP|October 12, 2006}}\n|refs=<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps15116.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n|release=2006\u2014[[PlayStation 2]]<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\"/>\n|notes=* Features 4-player versus mode<ref name=\"BladeBattlers\"/>\n* Released under ''[[The Best (PlayStation range)|The Best]]'' label on October 25, 2007 in Japan<ref name=\"BladeBattlersRR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps19329.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u301c PlayStation\u00ae2 the Best|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Video game titles/item\n|title=Bleach: Blade Battlers 2nd\n|date={{vgrelease|JP|September 27, 2007}}\n|refs=<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/scps15119.html|title=Bleach \u301c\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba2nd\u301c|publisher=[[PlayStation]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n|release=2007\u2014PlayStation 2<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2\"/>\n|notes=* Features 36 playable characters<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2PixFans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pixfans.com/analisis-de-bleach-blade-battlers-2nd/|author=Amorin Uzuki|title=An\u00e1lisis de Bleach Blade Battlers 2nd|date=October 4, 2007|publisher=pixfans.com|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n* The game features 4-player cooperative and versus modes<ref name=\"BladeBattlers2PixFans\"/>\n}}\n}}\n\n===''Bleach DS''===\nThe ''Bleach DS'' series are [[2D computer graphics|2-D]] games.
