The team currently competes in the [[Mid-American Conference]] East division. The Zips are currently coached by John Groce. Prior to becoming members of the MAC in 1992, the Zips were members of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] and the [[Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]].\n\nIn 2008, the Zips officially announced they had signed a three-year partnership to be outfitted by the [[LeBron James]] line by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. They are now the only team with a LJ23/Nike contract. Nike has released several Zips themed versions of LeBron's shoes.

The Zips won their first MAC East division title in 1998. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the [[2006 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] and won their first-ever post season game at [[Temple University]] before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first-ever appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami RedHawks]]. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA Tournament]] or [[2007 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]], despite finishing with a 26\u20137 record. The Zips posted a 24\u201311 record (11\u20135 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the [[2008 National Invitation Tournament]].\n\n==History==\nThe team was established in 1901, when the school was still known as Buchtel College, playing out of Crouse Gym, the school's original building, built in 1888.  They played their first game against [[Mount Union College]], a 120\u20139 loss.<ref name=history/> The team played just four games in the 1901\u20131902 season, winning their final two against the [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] medical school.  The team's first three seasons were spent without the benefit of a head coach.  This changed with the arrival of the first head coach, Earl Williams, who would coach from 1904\u20131908.<ref name=history/>\n\n===Early history===\nGrowing too big for Crouse, the team began playing at the Akron Armory, just a few blocks off-campus, in the 1920s. The Zips began play in the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] in 1923 where they would compete from 1923\u20131965 except for 1936\u20131944 when the University left the OAC and competed as an independent.  In the OAC, Akron would win 8 conference titles and five tournament titles, three of them under legendary coach, Tony Laterza.  In 1954 the Zips moved into their own on-campus home, [[Memorial Hall (University of Akron)|Memorial Hall]], located to the east of Crouse Gym. \nAfter the 1965\u20131966 season Akron left the OAC for good and competed as an independent in the NCAA's College Division, which would later be renamed [[NCAA Division II|Division II]].  When the NCAA divided into three divisions in 1973, the Zips would play one season in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] before moving to Division II, where they would play from 1975\u20131980.  During the final three years as a Division II member, the Zips were part of an earlier Mid-Continent Conference for two years before joining the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] for the 1979\u20131980 season (though they did not play conference games until the 1980\u20131981 season), their last in Division II.\nThe Zips participated in the NCAA Division II tournament on seven different occasions, making the Division II Final Four three times (1964, 1966, and 1972) and reaching the championship game in 1964 and 1972, falling to [[Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball|Evansville]] and [[Roanoke Maroons|Roanoke]], respectively.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite news |author= Akron Media Relations|title= Records and History|url= |work= 2008\u20132009 University of Akron Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher= University of Akron|year= 2008}}</ref>  Coach Laterza\u2019s winning percentage at UA of .751 (178\u201359 from 1960\u201368) remains best in the history of the program.\n\n* '''OAC regular-season titles''': 1919, 1920, 1934, 1946, 1953, 1958, 1965, 1966\n* '''OAC tournament titles''': 1949, 1956, 1964, 1965, 1966\n* '''NAIA tournament appearance''': 1943\n* '''NCAA Division II tournament appearances''': 1958, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1975\n* '''NCAA Division II Final Four''': 1964, 1966, 1972\n* '''NCAA Division II runner-up''': 1964, 1972\n\n===Division I era===\nAkron attained [[NCAA Division I]] status in 1980 and began play in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] that fall.<ref name=history/> In 1983, the Zips moved into their current arena, the [[James A. Rhodes Arena]], just to the east of old Memorial Hall.  In 1984 [[Bob Huggins]] began coaching the team, leading the Zips to the 1986 OVC title and tournament title to gain their first berth in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] as a No. 15 seed, where they fell to the 5th-ranked and No. 2-seeded [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines]] 70\u201364 in the first round. Akron would play one more season in the OVC and earn a berth in the 1987 [[National Invitation Tournament]] before another stint as an independent from 1987\u20131990. Huggins would lead the Zips to the 1989 NIT before leaving Akron after the season to coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]. Akron would rejoin the [[Mid-Continent Conference]] in 1990 and compete for two seasons before officially beginning play in the [[Mid-American Conference]] in 1992. The Zips struggled early on as members of the MAC including a disastrous 0\u201318 MAC season in 1995\u20131996 which saw the Zips finish the season 3\u201323 overall on a 21-game losing streak after a 3\u20131 start.  Akron posted their first winning season in MAC play during the 1997\u20131998 season under coach [[Dan Hipsher]] going 13\u20135 and winning the first-ever MAC East division title and qualifying for the [[Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|MAC tournament]] for the first time. The Zips posted winning MAC records in 1998\u20131999 and 1999\u20132000 before struggling for several seasons, ultimately leading to the dismissal of Hipsher and the hiring of [[Keith Dambrot]] as head coach in 2004.<ref name=history/>\n\n====Keith Dambrot era====\nDambrot had previously coached at nearby [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School]] in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and had coached [[LeBron James]].  Dambrot lead a resurgence in Zips basketball, posting a winning record (19\u201310, 11\u20137 MAC) in the 2004\u20132005 season, their first winning campaign since 2000, and a second MAC East division title in 2007.  Under Dambrot, the Zips have won 21 or more games in each of the last 12 seasons (beginning in 2005\u20132006) and have made ten postseason appearances: the 2009, 2011, and 2013 NCAA Tournament, the 2006, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2017 NIT, the 2010 CBI, and the 2014 CIT.<ref name=history/>  The 2006\u20132007 team tied the school record for wins, finishing 26\u20137, but failed to earn an invitation to any postseason tournament.  In 2007, the Zips advanced to the MAC tournament championship game for the first time in program history, losing on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami RedHawks]] at [[Quicken Loans Arena]] in [[Cleveland]].

The team currently competes in the [[Mid-American Conference]] East division. The Zips are currently coached by John Groce. Prior to becoming members of the MAC in 1992, the Zips were members of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] and the [[Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]].\n\nIn 2008, the Zips officially announced they had signed a three-year partnership to be outfitted by the [[LeBron James]] line by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. They are now the only team with a LJ23/Nike contract. Nike has released several Zips themed versions of LeBron's shoes. Some are available to the public, while others are exclusively for the members of the basketball team.<ref>http://www.gozips.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10800&ATCLID=1481389{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe team first played in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] when [[Bob Huggins]] was their coach. The Zips won their first MAC East division title in 1998. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the [[2006 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] and won their first-ever post season game at [[Temple University]] before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first-ever appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami RedHawks]]. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA Tournament]] or [[2007 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]], despite finishing with a 26\u20137 record. The Zips posted a 24\u201311 record (11\u20135 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the [[2008 National Invitation Tournament]].\n\n==History==\nThe team was established in 1901, when the school was still known as Buchtel College, playing out of Crouse Gym, the school's original building, built in 1888.  They played their first game against [[Mount Union College]], a 120\u20139 loss.<ref name=history/> The team played just four games in the 1901\u20131902 season, winning their final two against the [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] medical school.  The team's first three seasons were spent without the benefit of a head coach.  This changed with the arrival of the first head coach, Earl Williams, who would coach from 1904\u20131908.<ref name=history/>\n\n===Early history===\nGrowing too big for Crouse, the team began playing at the Akron Armory, just a few blocks off-campus, in the 1920s. The Zips began play in the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] in 1923 where they would compete from 1923\u20131965 except for 1936\u20131944 when the University left the OAC and competed as an independent.  In the OAC, Akron would win 8 conference titles and five tournament titles, three of them under legendary coach, Tony Laterza.  In 1954 the Zips moved into their own on-campus home, [[Memorial Hall (University of Akron)|Memorial Hall]], located to the east of Crouse Gym. \nAfter the 1965\u20131966 season Akron left the OAC for good and competed as an independent in the NCAA's College Division, which would later be renamed [[NCAA Division II|Division II]].  When the NCAA divided into three divisions in 1973, the Zips would play one season in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] before moving to Division II, where they would play from 1975\u20131980.  During the final three years as a Division II member, the Zips were part of an earlier Mid-Continent Conference for two years before joining the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] for the 1979\u20131980 season (though they did not play conference games until the 1980\u20131981 season), their last in Division II.\nThe Zips participated in the NCAA Division II tournament on seven different occasions, making the Division II Final Four three times (1964, 1966, and 1972) and reaching the championship game in 1964 and 1972, falling to [[Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball|Evansville]] and [[Roanoke Maroons|Roanoke]], respectively.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite news |author= Akron Media Relations|title= Records and History|url= |work= 2008\u20132009 University of Akron Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher= University of Akron|year= 2008}}</ref>  Coach Laterza\u2019s winning percentage at UA of .751 (178\u201359 from 1960\u201368) remains best in the history of the program.\n\n* '''OAC regular-season titles''': 1919, 1920, 1934, 1946, 1953, 1958, 1965, 1966\n* '''OAC tournament titles''': 1949, 1956, 1964, 1965, 1966\n* '''NAIA tournament appearance''': 1943\n* '''NCAA Division II tournament appearances''': 1958, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1975\n* '''NCAA Division II Final Four''': 1964, 1966, 1972\n* '''NCAA Division II runner-up''': 1964, 1972\n\n===Division I era===\nAkron attained [[NCAA Division I]] status in 1980 and began play in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] that fall.<ref name=history/> In 1983, the Zips moved into their current arena, the [[James A. Rhodes Arena]], just to the east of old Memorial Hall.  In 1984 [[Bob Huggins]] began coaching the team, leading the Zips to the 1986 OVC title and tournament title to gain their first berth in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] as a No. 15 seed, where they fell to the 5th-ranked and No. 2-seeded [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines]] 70\u201364 in the first round. Akron would play one more season in the OVC and earn a berth in the 1987 [[National Invitation Tournament]] before another stint as an independent from 1987\u20131990. Huggins would lead the Zips to the 1989 NIT before leaving Akron after the season to coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]. Akron would rejoin the [[Mid-Continent Conference]] in 1990 and compete for two seasons before officially beginning play in the [[Mid-American Conference]] in 1992. The Zips struggled early on as members of the MAC including a disastrous 0\u201318 MAC season in 1995\u20131996 which saw the Zips finish the season 3\u201323 overall on a 21-game losing streak after a 3\u20131 start.  Akron posted their first winning season in MAC play during the 1997\u20131998 season under coach [[Dan Hipsher]] going 13\u20135 and winning the first-ever MAC East division title and qualifying for the [[Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|MAC tournament]] for the first time. The Zips posted winning MAC records in 1998\u20131999 and 1999\u20132000 before struggling for several seasons, ultimately leading to the dismissal of Hipsher and the hiring of [[Keith Dambrot]] as head coach in 2004.<ref name=history/>\n\n====Keith Dambrot era====\nDambrot had previously coached at nearby [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School]] in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and had coached [[LeBron James]].  Dambrot lead a resurgence in Zips basketball, posting a winning record (19\u201310, 11\u20137 MAC) in the 2004\u20132005 season, their first winning campaign since 2000, and a second MAC East division title in 2007.  Under Dambrot, the Zips have won 21 or more games in each of the last 12 seasons (beginning in 2005\u20132006) and have made ten postseason appearances: the 2009, 2011, and 2013 NCAA Tournament, the 2006, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2017 NIT, the 2010 CBI, and the 2014 CIT.<ref name=history/>  The 2006\u20132007 team tied the school record for wins, finishing 26\u20137, but failed to earn an invitation to any postseason tournament.  In 2007, the Zips advanced to the MAC tournament championship game for the first time in program history, losing on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami RedHawks]] at [[Quicken Loans Arena]] in [[Cleveland]].
