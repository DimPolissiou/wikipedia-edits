Belasco pioneered many innovative new forms of stage lighting and special effects in order to create realism and naturalism.<ref name=Osnes>Osnes, Beth, and Gill, Sam.

Press (1975)</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nDavid Belasco was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], the son of Abraham H. Belasco (1830\u20131911) and Reyna Belasco (n\u00e9e Nunes, 1830\u20131899), [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who had moved from [[London]]\u2019s Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community during the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|13}} He began working in a San Francisco [[theatre]] doing a variety of routine jobs, such as [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]], script copier or as an extra in small parts.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|14}} He received his first experience as a stage manager while on the road. He said, \"We used to play in any place we could hire or get into{{mdash}}a hall, a big dining room, an empty barn; any place that would take us.\"<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|14}}\n\nFrom late 1873 to early 1874, he worked as an actor, director, and secretary at [[Piper's Opera House]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where he found \"more reckless women and desperadoes to the square foot\u2026than anywhere else in the world\". His developmental years as a supporting player in Virginia City colored his thoughts eventually helping him to conceive realistic stage settings. <ref> Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San Francisco Eastward: Victorian'' ''Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 181</ref> He said that while there, seeing \"people die under such peculiar circumstances\" made him \"all the more particular in regard to the psychology of dying on the stage. I think I was one of the first to bring naturalness to bear in death scenes, and my varied Virginia City experiences did much to help me toward this. Later I was to go deeper into such studies.\"  His recollections of that time were published in ''Hearst's Magazine'' in 1914.<ref>Belasco, David. ''Gala Days of Piper's Opera House and the California Theater''. 1914. Sparks, NV:, Falcon Hill Press, 1991: v\u2013vi, 18, 42</ref> By March 1874, he was back at work in San Francisco, eventually managing Thomas Maguire's Baldwin Theater. When Maguire lost the theater in 1882, Belasco relocated to the East Coast bringing his practical western experiences with him. The West allowed him to develop his talents as not only a performer, but in progressive production design and execution. <ref> Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San'' ''Francisco Eastward: Victorian Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 180-182. </ref>\n\nA gifted playwright, Belasco went to [[New York City]] in 1882 where he worked as stage manager for the [[Madison Square Theatre]] (starting with ''[[Young Mrs. Winthrop (play)|Young Mrs. Winthrop]]''), and then the [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885-1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]] while writing plays. By 1895, he was so successful that he was considered America's most distinguished playwright and producer.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:David Belasco 1873.jpg|thumb|Belasco in 1873]]\nDuring his long creative career, stretching between 1884 and 1930, Belasco either wrote, directed, or produced more than 100 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays including ''[[Hearts of Oak (play)|Hearts of Oak]]'', ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', and ''Du Barry'', making him the most powerful personality on the New York City theater scene. He also helped establish careers for dozens of notable stage performers, many of whom went on to work in films.\n\nAmong them were [[Mrs. Leslie Carter|Leslie Carter]], dubbed \"The American Sarah Bernhardt,\"<ref name=Wilson/> whose association with Belasco skyrocketed her to theatrical fame after her roles in ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' (1898) and ''Madame Du Barry'' (1901).<ref name=Wilson/> [[Ina Claire]]'s lead in ''Polly with a Past'' (1917) and [[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|''The Gold Diggers'']] (1919), similarly propelled her career.<ref name=Wilson/> Belasco wrote a lead part for 18-year-old [[Maude Adams]], in his new play, ''[[Men and Women (play)|Men and Women]]'' (1890), which ran for 200 performances.<ref name=Wilson/>\n\nOther stars whose careers he helped launch included [[Jeanne Eagels]], who would later achieve immortality as [[Sadie Thompson]] in ''Rain'' (1923), which played for 340 performances.<ref name=Botto>Botto, Louis; Viagas, Robert. ''At this Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories and Stars'', Hal Leonard Corp.

The two remained in touch after Pickford began working in Hollywood; Belasco appeared with her in the 1914 film adaptation of ''A Good Little Devil''. He is also credited as giving Pickford her stage name. He also worked with [[Lionel Barrymore]] who starred in his play ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'' opposite [[Lucille Kahn]], whose Broadway career Belasco launched. Belasco was a member of [[The Lambs]] from 1893 to 1931.\n\n==Marriage==\nDavid Belasco was married to Cecilia Loverich for over fifty years; they had two daughters, Reina (who was married to producer [[Morris Gest]]) and Augusta.\n\n==Death==\nBelasco died in 1931 at the age of 77 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |title=David Belasco Dies.

His productions inspired several generations of theatre lighting designers.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}\n\nBelasco's contributions to modern stage and lighting techniques were originally not appreciated as much as those of his European counterparts, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Antoine]] and [[Constantin Stanislavski]], however today he is regarded as \"one of the first significant directorial figures in the history of the American theatre,\" writes theatre historian Lise-Lone Marker.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}\n\nHe brought a new standard of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] to the American stage as the first to develop modern stage lighting along with the use of colored lights, via motorized color changing wheels, to evoke mood and setting.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}<ref name=Cox/> America's earliest stage lighting manufacturer, [[Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company|Kliegl Brothers]], began by serving the specialized needs of producers and directors such as Belasco and [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|157}} With regard to these modern lighting effects, Belasco is best remembered for his production of ''Girl of the Golden West'' (1905), with the play opening to a spectacular sunset which lasted five minutes before any dialogue started.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}\n\nBelasco became one of the first directors to eschew the use of traditional footlights in favor of lights concealed below floor level, thereby hidden from the audience. His lighting assistant, Louis Hartmann, realised Belasco's design ideas.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}} He also used follow spots to further create realism and often tailored his lighting configurations to complement the complexions and hair of the actors.<ref name=Cox>Cox, Jim. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RwVkMMLqMdkC Sold on Radio: Advertisers in the Golden Age of Broadcasting]''. Jefferson, North  Carolina: McFarland, 2008; reprint 2013. {{ISBN|9780786433919}}.</ref>{{rp|135}} He ordered a specially made 1000-watt lamp developed just for his own productions, and was the only director to have one for the first two years after its introduction (1914\u20131915).<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|135}}\n\nIn his own theatres, the dressing rooms were equipped with lamps of several colors, allowing the performers to see how their makeup looked under different lighting conditions.\n\nSupposedly he put appropriate scents to set scenes in the ventilation of the theaters, while his sets paid great attention to detail, and sometimes spilled out into the audience area. In one play, for instance, an operational laundromat was built onstage. In ''[[The Governor's Lady]]'', there was a reproduction of a [[Childs Restaurant]] kitchen where actors actually cooked and prepared food during the play. He is even said to have purchased a room in a [[flophouse]], cut it out of the building, brought it to his theater, cut out one wall and presented it as the set for a production. Belasco's original scripts were often filled with long, specific descriptions of props and set dressings. He has not been noted for producing unusually naturalistic scenarios.\n\nBelasco also embraced existing theatre technology and sought to expand on it. Both of Belasco's New York theatres were built on the cutting edge of their era's technology. When Belasco took over the Republic Theatre he drilled a new basement level to accommodate his machinery; the Stuyvesant Theatre was specially constructed with enormous amounts of flyspace, hydraulics systems and lighting rigs. The basement of the Stuyvesant contained a working machine shop, where Belasco and his team experimented with lighting and other special effects. Many of the innovations developed in the Belasco shop were sold to other producers.\n\n[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] references Belasco's reputation for realism in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' when he has a drunken visitor in the library of Gatsby's mansion exclaim in amazement that the books are genuine: \"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too\u2014didn't cut the pages.\"<ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRVGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT33 The Great Gatsby]'', chapter 3.</ref>\n\n==Theatres==\n{{See also|Belasco Theatre}}\n\nThe first Belasco Theatre in New York was located at 229 West 42nd Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, in the [[Times Square]] district of Manhattan. Belasco took over management of the theater and completely remodeled it in 1902, only two years after it was constructed as the Theatre Republic by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] (the grandfather of the famous lyricist). He gave up the theater in 1910 and it was renamed the Republic. Under various owners, it went through a tumultuous period as a [[burlesque]] venue, hosted second-run and, eventually, pornographic films and fell into a period of neglect before being rehabilitated and reopened as the [[New Victory Theater]] in 1995.\n\nThe second [[Belasco Theatre]] is located at 111 West 44th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, only a few blocks away from the New Victory. It was constructed in 1907 as the Stuyvesant Theatre and renamed after Belasco in 1910. The theater was built to Belasco's wishes, with [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] lighting and ceiling panels, rich woodwork and murals. His business office and private apartment were also housed there. The Belasco is still in operation as a Broadway venue with much of the original decor intact. In 2010 it underwent a massive US $14.5 million restoration, which strove to renovate and restore the theater to the condition it was in when David Belasco was alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/theater/29isherwood.html?pagewanted=all|title=Belasco Theater Is Burnished, and Back|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBelasco Theatres also existed in several other cities. In Los Angeles, the first Belasco Theatre was located at 337 S. Main St. The theater, which hosted the Belasco Stock Company, opened in 1904 and was operated by David Belasco's brother, Frederick. This theater was renamed twice: as the Republic in about 1913 and as the Follies, circa 1919. The theater eventually became a burlesque venue in the 1940s, fell into sharp decline, and was demolished in May 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/follies|title=Follies Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2202|title=Follies Theatre|work=cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nThe second, and perhaps more well known, Los Angeles Belasco Theatre is located at 1050 S. Hill St in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The theatre, which was built by Morgan, Walls & Clements, opened in 1926, and was managed by Edward Belasco, another of David's brothers. Many Hollywood stars with theatrical roots, as well as Broadway stars who were visiting the West Coast, appeared at the theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/belasco|title=Belasco Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref> The theater declined after the death of Edward Belasco in 1937.

Originally built in 1895 as the [[Lafayette Square Opera House]], at 717 Madison Place, across from the [[White House]], the theater was razed in 1962 and replaced by the [[U.S. Court of Claims]] building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/2813/white/east.html |title=White House Area - Sites on the East side of Lafayette Park |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2013-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015040930/http://library.thinkquest.org/2813/white/east.html |archivedate=2012-10-15 }}</ref>\n\n==Selected plays==\n*''[[Hearts of Oak (play)|Hearts of Oak]]'' (1879), by [[James A.

He said, \"We used to play in any place we could hire or get into{{mdash}}a hall, a big dining room, an empty barn; any place that would take us.\"<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|14}}\n\nFrom late 1873 to early 1874, he worked as an actor, director, and secretary at [[Piper's Opera House]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where he found \"more reckless women and desperadoes to the square foot\u2026than anywhere else in the world\". His developmental years as a supporting player in Virginia City colored his thoughts eventually helping him to conceive realistic stage settings. <ref> Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San Francisco Eastward: Victorian'' ''Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 181</ref> He said that while there, seeing \"people die under such peculiar circumstances\" made him \"all the more particular in regard to the psychology of dying on the stage. I think I was one of the first to bring naturalness to bear in death scenes, and my varied Virginia City experiences did much to help me toward this. Later I was to go deeper into such studies.\"  His recollections of that time were published in ''Hearst's Magazine'' in 1914.<ref>Belasco, David. ''Gala Days of Piper's Opera House and the California Theater''. 1914. Sparks, NV:, Falcon Hill Press, 1991: v\u2013vi, 18, 42</ref> By March 1874, he was back at work in San Francisco, eventually managing Thomas Maguire's Baldwin Theater. When Maguire lost the theater in 1882, Belasco relocated to the East Coast bringing his practical western experiences with him. The West allowed him to develop his talents as not only a performer, but in progressive production design and execution. <ref> Eichin, Carolyn Grattan, ''From San'' ''Francisco Eastward: Victorian Theater in the American West'', (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 180-182. </ref>\n\nA gifted playwright, Belasco went to [[New York City]] in 1882 where he worked as stage manager for the [[Madison Square Theatre]] (starting with ''[[Young Mrs. Winthrop (play)|Young Mrs. Winthrop]]''), and then the [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885-1902)|old Lyceum Theatre]] while writing plays. By 1895, he was so successful that he was considered America's most distinguished playwright and producer.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:David Belasco 1873.jpg|thumb|Belasco in 1873]]\nDuring his long creative career, stretching between 1884 and 1930, Belasco either wrote, directed, or produced more than 100 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays including ''[[Hearts of Oak (play)|Hearts of Oak]]'', ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', and ''Du Barry'', making him the most powerful personality on the New York City theater scene. He also helped establish careers for dozens of notable stage performers, many of whom went on to work in films.\n\nAmong them were [[Mrs. Leslie Carter|Leslie Carter]], dubbed \"The American Sarah Bernhardt,\"<ref name=Wilson/> whose association with Belasco skyrocketed her to theatrical fame after her roles in ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' (1898) and ''Madame Du Barry'' (1901).<ref name=Wilson/> [[Ina Claire]]'s lead in ''Polly with a Past'' (1917) and [[The Gold Diggers (1919 play)|''The Gold Diggers'']] (1919), similarly propelled her career.<ref name=Wilson/> Belasco wrote a lead part for 18-year-old [[Maude Adams]], in his new play, ''[[Men and Women (play)|Men and Women]]'' (1890), which ran for 200 performances.<ref name=Wilson/>\n\nOther stars whose careers he helped launch included [[Jeanne Eagels]], who would later achieve immortality as [[Sadie Thompson]] in ''Rain'' (1923), which played for 340 performances.<ref name=Botto>Botto, Louis; Viagas, Robert. ''At this Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories and Stars'', Hal Leonard Corp.

He launched the career of [[Barbara Stanwyck]], which included changing her name.<ref name=Wilson/>\n\nBelasco is perhaps most famous for having adapted the short story ''[[Madame Butterfly (short story)|Madame Butterfly]]'' into [[Madame Butterfly (play)|a play with the same name]] and for penning ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (play)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' for the stage, both of which were adapted as operas by [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' 1904\u2014twice,  after revision) and ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (1910). More than forty [[motion pictures]] have been made from the many plays he authored.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=To me, David Belasco was like the King of England, Julius Caesar and Napoleon rolled into one.|source=[[Mary Pickford]]<ref name=Wilson>Wilson, Victoria. ''A Life of Barbara Stanwyck: Steel-True 1907-1940'', Simon and Schuster (2013) ebook</ref>}}\n\nMany prominent performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries sought the opportunity to work with Belasco; among them were [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]]<ref name=Wilson/> and [[Cecil B. DeMille]].<ref name=Wilson/> DeMille's father had been close friends with Belasco, and after DeMille graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he began his stage career under Belasco's guidance.<ref>Wallace, David.

The two remained in touch after Pickford began working in Hollywood; Belasco appeared with her in the 1914 film adaptation of ''A Good Little Devil''. He is also credited as giving Pickford her stage name. He also worked with [[Lionel Barrymore]] who starred in his play ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'' opposite [[Lucille Kahn]], whose Broadway career Belasco launched. Belasco was a member of [[The Lambs]] from 1893 to 1931.\n\n==Marriage==\nDavid Belasco was married to Cecilia Loverich for over fifty years; they had two daughters, Reina (who was married to producer [[Morris Gest]]) and Augusta.\n\n==Death==\nBelasco died in 1931 at the age of 77 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |title=David Belasco Dies.

His productions inspired several generations of theatre lighting designers.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}\n\nBelasco's contributions to modern stage and lighting techniques were originally not appreciated as much as those of his European counterparts, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Antoine]] and [[Constantin Stanislavski]], however today he is regarded as \"one of the first significant directorial figures in the history of the American theatre,\" writes theatre historian Lise-Lone Marker.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}\n\nHe brought a new standard of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] to the American stage as the first to develop modern stage lighting along with the use of colored lights, via motorized color changing wheels, to evoke mood and setting.<ref name=Marker/>{{rp|xi}}<ref name=Cox/> America's earliest stage lighting manufacturer, [[Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company|Kliegl Brothers]], began by serving the specialized needs of producers and directors such as Belasco and [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|157}} With regard to these modern lighting effects, Belasco is best remembered for his production of ''Girl of the Golden West'' (1905), with the play opening to a spectacular sunset which lasted five minutes before any dialogue started.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}}\n\nBelasco became one of the first directors to eschew the use of traditional footlights in favor of lights concealed below floor level, thereby hidden from the audience. His lighting assistant, Louis Hartmann, realised Belasco's design ideas.<ref name=Cox/>{{rp|29}} He also used follow spots to further create realism and often tailored his lighting configurations to complement the complexions and hair of the actors.<ref name=Cox>Cox, Jim.

In one play, for instance, an operational laundromat was built onstage. In ''[[The Governor's Lady]]'', there was a reproduction of a [[Childs Restaurant]] kitchen where actors actually cooked and prepared food during the play. He is even said to have purchased a room in a [[flophouse]], cut it out of the building, brought it to his theater, cut out one wall and presented it as the set for a production. Belasco's original scripts were often filled with long, specific descriptions of props and set dressings. He has not been noted for producing unusually naturalistic scenarios.\n\nBelasco also embraced existing theatre technology and sought to expand on it. Both of Belasco's New York theatres were built on the cutting edge of their era's technology. When Belasco took over the Republic Theatre he drilled a new basement level to accommodate his machinery; the Stuyvesant Theatre was specially constructed with enormous amounts of flyspace, hydraulics systems and lighting rigs. The basement of the Stuyvesant contained a working machine shop, where Belasco and his team experimented with lighting and other special effects. Many of the innovations developed in the Belasco shop were sold to other producers.\n\n[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] references Belasco's reputation for realism in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' when he has a drunken visitor in the library of Gatsby's mansion exclaim in amazement that the books are genuine: \"See!\" he cried triumphantly. \"It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too\u2014didn't cut the pages.\"<ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uRVGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT33 The Great Gatsby]'', chapter 3.</ref>\n\n==Theatres==\n{{See also|Belasco Theatre}}\n\nThe first Belasco Theatre in New York was located at 229 West 42nd Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, in the [[Times Square]] district of Manhattan. Belasco took over management of the theater and completely remodeled it in 1902, only two years after it was constructed as the Theatre Republic by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] (the grandfather of the famous lyricist). He gave up the theater in 1910 and it was renamed the Republic. Under various owners, it went through a tumultuous period as a [[burlesque]] venue, hosted second-run and, eventually, pornographic films and fell into a period of neglect before being rehabilitated and reopened as the [[New Victory Theater]] in 1995.\n\nThe second [[Belasco Theatre]] is located at 111 West 44th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, only a few blocks away from the New Victory. It was constructed in 1907 as the Stuyvesant Theatre and renamed after Belasco in 1910. The theater was built to Belasco's wishes, with [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] lighting and ceiling panels, rich woodwork and murals. His business office and private apartment were also housed there. The Belasco is still in operation as a Broadway venue with much of the original decor intact. In 2010 it underwent a massive US $14.5 million restoration, which strove to renovate and restore the theater to the condition it was in when David Belasco was alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/theater/29isherwood.html?pagewanted=all|title=Belasco Theater Is Burnished, and Back|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBelasco Theatres also existed in several other cities. In Los Angeles, the first Belasco Theatre was located at 337 S. Main St. The theater, which hosted the Belasco Stock Company, opened in 1904 and was operated by David Belasco's brother, Frederick. This theater was renamed twice: as the Republic in about 1913 and as the Follies, circa 1919. The theater eventually became a burlesque venue in the 1940s, fell into sharp decline, and was demolished in May 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/follies|title=Follies Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2202|title=Follies Theatre|work=cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nThe second, and perhaps more well known, Los Angeles Belasco Theatre is located at 1050 S. Hill St in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The theatre, which was built by Morgan, Walls & Clements, opened in 1926, and was managed by Edward Belasco, another of David's brothers. Many Hollywood stars with theatrical roots, as well as Broadway stars who were visiting the West Coast, appeared at the theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/belasco|title=Belasco Theatre - Historic Los Angeles Theatres - Downtown|work=google.com}}</ref> The theater declined after the death of Edward Belasco in 1937.

On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Kolozsv\u00e1r. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]] and the 6th Division to Brass\u00f3 ([[Bra\u015fov]]). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\").

The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary.\n\nOn 4 April, South African General [[Jan Smuts]] was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note.

There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General [[Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu]] commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Mo\u015foiu. Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]].

The Hungarian Army recruited men between 19\u201325 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions\u201440 battalions\u2014to [[Upper Hungary]].\n\nOn 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel [[Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld]] attacked and routed Czech troops from [[Miskolc]]. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czech army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian army retreated to its bridgehead at [[Tokaj]]. There, between 25\u201330 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks.\n\nOn 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from [[Bukovina]] since 22 May.

The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}.

Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].

They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Budapest ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianArmyInFrontOfBudapestParliament.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian army in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], Budapest, 1919.]]\n[[File:Romanian troops in Budapest 1919.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919.]]\nRomanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns\u2014including two with a caliber of 305&nbsp;mm\u2014332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianSoldiersFeedingCiviliansInBudapest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary.]]\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 36.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest.]]\nOn 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]] was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] as Hungary's head of state and [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Hungary ===\nRomania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around [[Lake Balaton]].

Its action continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian\u2013Romanian war.\n\n== November 1918 \u2013 March 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nFollowing the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest, the bulk of the Romanian Army was demobilized. Only the 9th and 10th infantry divisions and the 1st and 2nd [[cavalry]] divisions were at full strength. However, those units were engaged in the protection of [[Bessarabia]] against the Bolshevik Soviet Russians. The 1st, 7th and 8th [[Huntsmen (military)|V\u00e2n\u0103tori]] divisions, stationed in [[Moldavia]], were the first units to be mobilized. The 8th was sent to [[Bukovina]] and the other two were sent to Transylvania. On 13 November, the 7th entered Transylvania at the [[Pris\u0103cani River]] in the eastern Carpathians. The 1st then entered Transylvania at [[Palanca, Bac\u0103u]].<ref>Mardarescu G.D.

This was a demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Allied powers and Hungary at the Armistice of Belgrade. At the same time units of the German army, under the command of Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], retreated to the west.\n\nFollowing a request from Romania, the Allied Command in the east under the leadership of French Genenral [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] allowed the Romanian army to advance to the line of the western Carpathians. The 7th V\u00e2n\u0103tori division advanced in the direction of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]]. The 1st division advanced in the direction of [[Alba-Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Kolozsv\u00e1r. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]] and the 6th Division to Brass\u00f3 ([[Bra\u015fov]]). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\"). The K\u00e1rolyi government would not accept the terms and this was a trigger for the coup d'\u00e9tat by [[B\u00e9la Kun]], who formed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Around this time limited skirmishes took place between Romanian and Hungarian troops. Some Hungarian elements engaged in the harassment of the Romanian population outside the area controlled by the Romanian Army.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\">Kiritescu C.

The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary.\n\nOn 4 April, South African General [[Jan Smuts]] was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note. Smuts' mission also represented official recognition of the Kun communist government by the Allied council. He may have asked if Kun would act as a conduit for communication between the Allied council and the Bolshevik Soviet Russians.<ref>Read A.

Kun refused the terms, demanding that  Romanian forces return to the line of the Maros River. Smuts' negotiations ceased.\n\nKun stalled for time{{how|date=July 2017}} in order to build a force capable of fighting Romania and Czechoslovakia. Hungary had 20,000 troops facing the Romanian army and mobilized a further 60,000. There were recruitment centers in towns such as [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Szolnok]]. There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General [[Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu]] commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Mo\u015foiu. Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]]. This would separate the elite Hungarian [[Sz\u00e9kely]] division from the rest of the Hungarian army. The north battalion would then outflank the Hungarian Army. Simultaneously, the south battalion would advance to [[Lipova, Arad|M\u00e1riaradna]] and [[Beiu\u015f|Bel\u00e9nyes]].\n\n== Hostilities begin ==\n\n=== Foreign policy scandal: the establishment of Slovak Soviet Republic ===\n\nIn late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to \"fulfill\" his promise to adhere to Hungary's historical borders.

The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld, it ousted Czech troops from the north, and planned to march against the Romanian army in the east.\n\nKun ordered the preparation of an [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|offensive against Czechoslovakia]], which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Army recruited men between 19\u201325 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions\u201440 battalions\u2014to [[Upper Hungary]].\n\nOn 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel [[Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld]] attacked and routed Czech troops from [[Miskolc]]. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czech army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian army retreated to its bridgehead at [[Tokaj]]. There, between 25\u201330 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks.\n\nOn 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from [[Bukovina]] since 22 May. Hungary then controlled the territory to its [[Kingdom of Hungary|old borders]]; regained control of industrial areas around [[Miskolc]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica|Selmecb\u00e1nya]], [[Ko\u0161ice|Kassa]].\n\n===Demoralization of the Red Army===\nDespite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Eperjes) on 16 June 1919.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jack A.

Despite a series of military victories against the Czechoslovak army, the Hungarian Red Army started to disintegrate due to tension between nationalists and communists during the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic.

They established two concentric defense lines extending from the Tisza River around Szolnok. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines. On the evening of 1 May the entire east bank of the Tisza River was under the control of the Romanian army.\n\nOn 30 April, French Foreign Minister [[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] summoned [[Ion I.C. Br\u0103tianu]], the Romanian representative to the Paris Peace Conference. Romania was told to cease its advance at the Tisza River and retreat to the first demarcation line imposed by the Allied council.

The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}.

Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Soviet Russia]] to attack Bessarabia.\n\n=== Romanian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155&nbsp;mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Budapest ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianArmyInFrontOfBudapestParliament.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian army in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], Budapest, 1919.]]\n[[File:Romanian troops in Budapest 1919.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919.]]\nRomanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns\u2014including two with a caliber of 305&nbsp;mm\u2014332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianSoldiersFeedingCiviliansInBudapest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary.]]\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 36.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest.]]\nOn 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]] was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] as Hungary's head of state and [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Hungary ===\nRomania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around [[Lake Balaton]].

Originally formed in 1993 as the Victorian branch of the Public Transport Union (an amalgamation of several smaller trade unions representing workers in public transport industries) and renamed the RTBU in 1998, the RTBU Victoria today represents nearly 8000 members across Rail Operations, Tramways, Locomotive, Infrastructure and Administrative areas of Victoria's public transport industry.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n== Beginnings and original affiliates ==\n\nThe formation of Rail, Tram & Bus Union in 1998, formed as the Public Transport Union five years earlier, was the product of several older public transport unions amalgamating together in Victoria and nationally. Each of these unions had their own unique history and traditions prior to amalgamation.\n\n=== Australian Railways Union ===\n\nThe Australian Railways Union (ARU) represented workers in railways and transport and was the largest of the public transport unions amalgamating into the PTU. Prior to unifying as a national union in 1921, the first rail workers\u2019 union was the Victorian Railways Union (VRU) formed in 1911.<ref>Butler-Bowdon, Eddie. In the Service? A history of the Victorian railway workers and their union (Melbourne: Hyland House, 1991), p 27.</ref>  The VRU was unique as the first ever industry-wide union formed in Australia for all workers in the railways including drivers, station staff, labourers and maintenance workers.\n\nThe Victorian ARU's headquarters from 1916 was the historical Unity Hall building on 636 Bourke Street, Melbourne. Unity Hall served as a meeting place both for the ARU and the Victorian union movement for much of the 20th century until it was sold in 1999 due to financial burdens suffered by the union in the Kennett era. The building remains a heritage-listed site.<ref>\u201cUnity Hall\u201d, On my Doorstep website, {{cite web |url=https://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/9324/unity-hall |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223074323/https://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/9324/unity-hall |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Victorian ARU was controlled by left-wing and militant forces in the labour movement virtually from its outset, coming under the control of unionists aligned with the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in the 1930s, and remained so for much of its existence<ref>In the Service?, p 106.</ref>  \u2013 the ARU's political alignments under the CPA were such that it disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Party in 1943<ref>Strangio, Paul. Neither Power nor Glory: 100 Years of Political Labor in Victoria, 1856\u20131870 (Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press), 2012, p 253.</ref>  for what it perceived as the party's unsatisfactory policies on employment in the railways before re-affiliating in 1953.\n\n=== National Union of Rail Workers ===\n\nThe National Union of Rail Workers of Australia (NURWA) also represented train drivers and rail workers. The union originally registered under the name National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) in March 1933 before being de-registered four months later.<ref>\u201cThe National Union of Rail Workers (1982\u20131993)\u201d, [[Australian Trade Union Archives]], http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0652b.htm</ref>  The NUR later revived itself in December 1938 and proceeded to merge with several smaller craft unions, including the Government Railways Transport Staff Association, the Department of Main Roads Employees\u2019 Union and the Government Tramway Electrical Branch Workers\u2019 Association.<ref name=\":1\">\u201cNational Union of Rail Workers of Australia\u201d, ANU Archives, http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/national-union-of-railworkers-of-australia</ref>  The NUR renamed itself the National Union of Rail Workers of Australia in 1982 and continued under this name until amalgamation in 1993.<ref name=\":1\" />  The NURWA was a relatively small union compared with the ARU with a national membership of a few hundred by 1993.\n\n=== Australian Tramways & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association ===\n\nThe Australian Tramways & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association (AT&MOEA or ATMOEA) represented drivers and conductors in the tramways. The union was formed in 1910 as the Australian Tramways\u2019 Employees Association before changing its title to ATMOEA in 1934.<ref>\u201cAustralian Tramway & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association (ii) (19501-1993)\u201d, Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0272b.htm</ref>  Like the ARU, the ATMOEA in Victoria was politically dominated by the CPA \u2013 when the party split in 1964 over allegiances to the Soviet Union or People's Republic of China, the ATMOEA's Victorian leadership became aligned with the pro-Beijing and Maoist Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) or CPA-ML.<ref>Jones, Russell. \u201cClarrie O\u2019Shea \u2013 Hero or villain?\u201d, Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot, last modified June 2008, http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/oshea.htm</ref>  The ATMOEA was briefly de-registered in 1950 but re-formed under the same name that year.<ref>Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0272b.htm</ref>\n\n=== Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen ===\n\nThe [[Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen]] (AFULE) represented locomotive drivers and crew in Australia from the 1920s. Locomotive enginemen originally organised alongside firemen as craft unions, with the first in Australia being the Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers\u2019 Association formed in 1861. The idea of a federated national body for enginemen was first proposed at a Victorian Conference of locomotive associations in 1886, which eventually occurred at the turn of the century with the formation of the Federated Locomotive Enginemen's Association of Australasia. This was renamed the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen in 1920. The Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers\u2019 Association opted not to ballot its members on whether to amalgamate into the industry-wide VRU in 1911. The Association and later Victorian AFULE therefore remained a separate union from the ARU in Victoria for most of the 20th century. In 1993 the AFULE in Victoria and all other states and territories except Queensland voted to amalgamate into the PTU.<ref>\"History\", Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Employees website, http://www.afule.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=18</ref><ref>\u201cLocomotive Engine Drivers & Firemens Association (1872\u20131900)\u201d, Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE1139b.htm</ref><ref>\u201cHistory\u201d, Rail, Tram & Bus Union Victorian Locomotive Division website, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbuvicloco.com.au/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629200850/http://www.rtbuvicloco.com.au/history.html |archive-date=29 June 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\">In the Service?, p 27.</ref>\n \n== History ==\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nThe development of rail lines in Victoria began around the middle of the 19th century, with the state government monopolising control of the railways in 1856.<ref>In the Service?, p 5.</ref> Significant expansion of railroads in the 1880s lead to a surge of those employed on the railway lines, including engine drivers, station masters and staff, clerks, labourers and gangers. These workers soon organised themselves into employees\u2019 associations and [[Craft unionism|craft unions]] (i.e. unions representing workers of a particular skill-set or grade, often within the same industry).\n\n=== Victorian Railways Union ===\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the existence of separate craft unions for employees in the Victorian railways was the norm, with train drivers and crew, signalmen, shunters, station masters, staff and rail labourers all organised into different unions based on their grade of work.<ref>In the Service?, p 19.</ref> That owed a great deal to the hierarchical nature of employment on the railways, with differences being especially pronounced between locomotive drivers, station staff and clerks, and \"unskilled\" workers. That invariably led to different scales of pay and complex bargaining for different groups of workers, and convinced many of the need for an industry-wide union. The first attempt at a united union occurred in 1884, when rail labourers formed an all-grades Mutual Services Association.<ref>In the Service?</ref> Labourers were the lowest-paid workers in the railways and hence the most committed to the benefits of an industry-wide union, but [[Craft unionism|entrenched divisions]] between grades of workers made most other rail employees hesitant to join. The Association renamed itself the Amalgamated Society of Railway Employees (ASRE) in 1900.<ref>In the Service?, p 20.</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the 1890s Depression, and its effects upon their wages and security of work, the attitude of rail employees towards an industry-wide union began to shift. In 1903, the government of conservative Premier [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] sought to stifle the electoral threat of rail workers\u2019 anger at pay cuts by passing of the Separate Representation Act. The Act barred railway employees from voting in their own electorates, instead being allotted two separate seats in [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|State Parliament's lower house]]. The ensuing campaign to repeal the Act galvanised rail workers\u2019 commitment to unionism and bolstered the ASRE's ranks.<ref>In the Service?, p 25-26.</ref> In July 1911, after a ballot of members on the question of an industry-wide union which resulted in a strongly affirmative opinion, the ASRE and all other craft unions in the railways, with the exception of the locomotive drivers' association, combined to form the Victorian Railways Union (VRU).<ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\"/> The VRU later became the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union (ARU) when railways unions from each state and territory unified nationally in 1921.<ref>\"Victorian Railways Union (1911\u20131921)\", Australian Trade Union Archives, last modified 12 December 2002, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0926b.htm</ref>\n\nThe VRU's first Secretary was Frank Hyett, an ardent socialist who, despite lacking a personal background in the railways, quickly established himself as an able and dedicated organiser for the union, proving highly effective in uniting the different associations and craft unions into the VRU.<ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\"/>  The ''Gazette'', which was the newspaper of the VRU, and later the Victorian branch of the ARU, for nearly a century, carried the motto \u201cWork and vote for Socialism\u201d.<ref>In the Service?, \u2018Note on Sources\u2019.</ref>\n\nThe Victorian branch of the ARU was also notable for being one of the few left-wing unions in Australia to have been both captured and subsequently lost by anti-communist elements in the years leading up to the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955]]. A [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-dominated and anti-communist [[Industrial Groups|Industrial Group]] ticket, led by shunter Jim Neill, mounted a successful campaign to oust the incumbent [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA) leadership at branch elections in the early 1950s, with Neill supplanting J.J. Brown as State Secretary in 1954. However, Brown and the CPA militants succeeded in reclaiming the Victorian branch from the Groupers by 1955, after which the Victorian ARU remained firmly under left-wing control.<ref>In the Service?, p 128-131.</ref>\n\n=== Clarrie O\u2019Shea and 1969 General Strike ===\n\nOne of the greatest episodes of industrial unrest in the post-World War II history of Australia's union movement took place in 1969 following the arrest and jailing of ATMOEA Victorian Secretary, [[Clarrie O'Shea|Clarrie O\u2019Shea]] for refusal to pay penal fines incurred for striking.\n\nO\u2019Shea, a Maoist aligned with the [[Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist)|CPA (M-L)]], had pursued a campaign of consistent industrial militancy since being elected ATMOEA State Secretary in 1947 to defend and advance his members\u2019 wages and conditions, sick leave and benefits. The strikes and work stoppages this entailed incurred heavy penal fines on the ATMOEA under the penal section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act \u2013 this legislation had been introduced by the Commonwealth Government in 1951 in an effort to deter industrial action on the part of unions. Bans clauses introduced by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission also existed at this time to deter strike action.<ref name=\":2\">\"Clarrie O\u2019Shea \u2013 Hero or villain?\" http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/oshea.htm</ref>\n\nBy 1969 the Victorian ATMOEA had accrued more than $13000 in fines under the Act for striking and was ordered by the Commonwealth Industrial Court to pay over $8000 up front. Rather than pay the fines however O\u2019Shea refused to obey the Court's orders and repeatedly refused to accept its summonses.<ref name=\":2\" />  O\u2019Shea finally appeared at the Industrial Court in Melbourne on 15 May \u2013 on the day of his appearance over 5000 unionists marched to the Court in a rally organised by a committee of 27 \u201crebel\u201d left-wing unions in Victoria sympathetic to O\u2019Shea.<ref>\u201cAbolish the Penal Powers: Freedom Fight of \u201869\u201d.

Huge marches took place in every Australian city demanding O\u2019Shea's release and the abolition of the Commonwealth anti-strike clauses, with cities including Melbourne and Hobart being virtually ground to a halt. Sentiment against the penal powers was very strong in the union movement by this time, with unions across Australia owing more than $300000 in strike fines at the time of O\u2019Shea's jailing. On the sixth day of the general strike, Clarrie O\u2019Shea was finally released after the ATMOEA's outstanding fines were paid on behalf of an \"anonymous benefactor\" alleged to have won the NSW lottery, widely believed to have been acting on behalf of the federal government. Upon his release, O\u2019Shea said, \"My release is a great victory for workers...The infinite power of the workers when they are really aroused has frightened the life out of the government and the employers...\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe outcome of the general strike was a huge victory both for the ATMOEA and the Australian union movement \u2013 while bans clauses remain on the books of Commonwealth legislation, most of the anti-strike penal clauses were abolished in the ensuing years and as a consequence of the strike have never been invoked by the Commonwealth Government in any industrial dispute since.<ref>Heagney, M.E. \"How significant was the Clarrie O\u2019Shea case?\", Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, http://asslh.org.au/hummer/no-8/oshea-case/</ref>\n\n=== 1990 Melbourne tram dispute and lock-out ===\n\nIn 1989 the Victorian Cain Labor Government announced that it would seek to abolish all tram conductors as a cost-cutting measure as part of its effort to arrest the state's fiscal crisis. This was a huge blow for the Victorian ATMOEA, for whom tram conductors had been the backbone of the union and an iconic feature of Melbourne.\n\nAfter several months of ongoing campaigning against the planned abolitions, on 1 January tram drivers and conductors took control of their trams and began to operate them for free as a \u201cwork-in\u201d in protest against the State Government's plans. The State Government responded by cutting power to Melbourne's tram grid, leaving hundreds of trams grounded in the city's CBD between Elizabeth and Bourke Street. At the same time tramways workers occupied and took control of tram depots at Essendon, Brunswick and South Melbourne as part of their effort to demand that Premier John Cain and Transport Minister Jim Kennan to reverse their plans to abolish conductors. The dispute ultimately turned into a month-long lock-out \u2013 although Melbourne's tramways were left paralysed for the duration of the dispute, the abolition of conductors ultimately went ahead. Despite this the ATMOEA did win some concessions as a result of the dispute, with tram conductors being phased out gradually over an 8-year period and many being retrained as ticket inspectors.<ref>Wood, Katie, \u201cWorkers\u2019 power on Melbourne\u2019s trams\u201d, Red Flag, 11 March 2014, http://redflag.org.au/article/workers%E2%80%99-power-melbourne%E2%80%99s-trams</ref>\n\n=== Kennett era and privatisation ===\n\nVictoria's public transport unions suffered significant losses in size and industrial clout under the State Liberal Government of Jeff Kennett from 1992\u201399. Following his election as Premier Kennett pursued a strongly neo-liberal program of cost-cutting and privatisation of services purportedly to revive Victoria's flagging economy \u2013 this took the form of drastically cutting back and de-regulating Victoria's public transport sector, with the sacking of 16,000 public transport workers, the closure and scaling back of several train lines and the eventual privatisation of Victoria's public transport system in 1999 all taking place.<ref>Carey, Adam. \u201cTransport companies suck $2.6 billion\u201d. The Age. 12 July 2013.</ref>\n\nDespite industrial action and stopworks<ref>Bates, Tully. \u201cMelbourne transport workers strike\u201d, Green Left Weekly, 12 March 1997, https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/15305</ref>  the impact of these changes on Victorian transport unions was huge \u2013 redundancies bought the Victorian ARU's workforce density down to 1 percent at one stage, while the phasing out of Melbourne tram conductors by 1998 caused the ATMOEA to also shrink sizeably. These cutbacks in Victoria and throughout Australia were key to these unions\u2019 decision to amalgamate.\n\nIt was also during the 1990s that control of the Victorian ARU began to change hands from the old CPA-aligned leadership to a new group of union activists based around the Rank-and-File Committee ticket. The Victorian ATMOEA experienced parallel changes, with control of the state branch swinging from its old guard Maoist leadership to a moderate-leaning ticket around this time.\n\n=== Amalgamation ===\n\nIn 1993, Australia's public transport unions resolved that the impact of changes in the public transport industry was such that it would be to their members\u2019 benefit to amalgamate into a single union. The national and state branches of the ARU, ATMOEA, AFULE and NURWA consequently balloted their members on the question as to whether they favoured amalgamation, in which over 85% of their combined members voted \u2018Yes\u2019. As a result, these unions amalgamated into a single Public Transport Union (PTU) in February 1993.<ref>RTBU National Website, \u201cA Short History of the RTBU\u201d, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223072150/http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe first State Secretary of the Victorian branch of the PTU was former ARU Branch Secretary Peter Bourke. The need for unity within the newly formed PTU in Victoria was paramount, with each amalgamating union bringing with it a strong desire to maintain autonomy from one-another that might have been an obstacle to unity. Despite these challenges the State Branch's leadership proved successful in making the PTU into a coherent union representing the interests of its members in all areas of public transport.\n\nThe PTU and its amalgamated divisions continued to suffer declining membership throughout the 1990s due to job losses in public transport in all states and territories. Despite the downturn of this period the PTU in Victoria was still able to accomplish significant industrial action, most notably a 48-hour strike during the 1997 Grand Prix weekend in protest at State Government plans to dissolve the Public Transport Corporation.<ref>\"Melbourne transport workers strike\", Green Left Weekly, https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/15305</ref>\n\n=== Renamed RTBU ===\n\nIn March 1998 the PTU chose to rename itself the Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union (RTBU) to reflect the privatisation of numerous public transport services in Australia.<ref>\u201cA Short History of the RTBU\u201d, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223072150/http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref> Since the 2000s the RTBU in Victoria has been able to gradually rebuild its membership from the Kennett years.

Originally formed in 1993 as the Victorian branch of the Public Transport Union (an amalgamation of several smaller trade unions representing workers in public transport industries) and renamed the RTBU in 1998, the RTBU Victoria today represents nearly 8000 members across Rail Operations, Tramways, Locomotive, Infrastructure and Administrative areas of Victoria's public transport industry.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n== Beginnings and original affiliates ==\n\nThe formation of Rail, Tram & Bus Union in 1998, formed as the Public Transport Union five years earlier, was the product of several older public transport unions amalgamating together in Victoria and nationally. Each of these unions had their own unique history and traditions prior to amalgamation.\n\n=== Australian Railways Union ===\n\nThe Australian Railways Union (ARU) represented workers in railways and transport and was the largest of the public transport unions amalgamating into the PTU. Prior to unifying as a national union in 1921, the first rail workers\u2019 union was the Victorian Railways Union (VRU) formed in 1911.<ref>Butler-Bowdon, Eddie. In the Service? A history of the Victorian railway workers and their union (Melbourne: Hyland House, 1991), p 27.</ref>  The VRU was unique as the first ever industry-wide union formed in Australia for all workers in the railways including drivers, station staff, labourers and maintenance workers.\n\nThe Victorian ARU's headquarters from 1916 was the historical Unity Hall building on 636 Bourke Street, Melbourne. Unity Hall served as a meeting place both for the ARU and the Victorian union movement for much of the 20th century until it was sold in 1999 due to financial burdens suffered by the union in the Kennett era. The building remains a heritage-listed site.<ref>\u201cUnity Hall\u201d, On my Doorstep website, {{cite web |url=https://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/9324/unity-hall |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223074323/https://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/9324/unity-hall |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Victorian ARU was controlled by left-wing and militant forces in the labour movement virtually from its outset, coming under the control of unionists aligned with the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in the 1930s, and remained so for much of its existence<ref>In the Service?, p 106.</ref>  \u2013 the ARU's political alignments under the CPA were such that it disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Party in 1943<ref>Strangio, Paul. Neither Power nor Glory: 100 Years of Political Labor in Victoria, 1856\u20131870 (Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press), 2012, p 253.</ref>  for what it perceived as the party's unsatisfactory policies on employment in the railways before re-affiliating in 1953.\n\n=== National Union of Rail Workers ===\n\nThe National Union of Rail Workers of Australia (NURWA) also represented train drivers and rail workers. The union originally registered under the name National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) in March 1933 before being de-registered four months later.<ref>\u201cThe National Union of Rail Workers (1982\u20131993)\u201d, [[Australian Trade Union Archives]], http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0652b.htm</ref>  The NUR later revived itself in December 1938 and proceeded to merge with several smaller craft unions, including the Government Railways Transport Staff Association, the Department of Main Roads Employees\u2019 Union and the Government Tramway Electrical Branch Workers\u2019 Association.<ref name=\":1\">\u201cNational Union of Rail Workers of Australia\u201d, ANU Archives, http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/national-union-of-railworkers-of-australia</ref>  The NUR renamed itself the National Union of Rail Workers of Australia in 1982 and continued under this name until amalgamation in 1993.<ref name=\":1\" />  The NURWA was a relatively small union compared with the ARU with a national membership of a few hundred by 1993.\n\n=== Australian Tramways & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association ===\n\nThe Australian Tramways & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association (AT&MOEA or ATMOEA) represented drivers and conductors in the tramways. The union was formed in 1910 as the Australian Tramways\u2019 Employees Association before changing its title to ATMOEA in 1934.<ref>\u201cAustralian Tramway & Motor Omnibus Employees\u2019 Association (ii) (19501-1993)\u201d, Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0272b.htm</ref>  Like the ARU, the ATMOEA in Victoria was politically dominated by the CPA \u2013 when the party split in 1964 over allegiances to the Soviet Union or People's Republic of China, the ATMOEA's Victorian leadership became aligned with the pro-Beijing and Maoist Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) or CPA-ML.<ref>Jones, Russell. \u201cClarrie O\u2019Shea \u2013 Hero or villain?\u201d, Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot, last modified June 2008, http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/oshea.htm</ref>  The ATMOEA was briefly de-registered in 1950 but re-formed under the same name that year.<ref>Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0272b.htm</ref>\n\n=== Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen ===\n\nThe [[Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen]] (AFULE) represented locomotive drivers and crew in Australia from the 1920s. Locomotive enginemen originally organised alongside firemen as craft unions, with the first in Australia being the Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers\u2019 Association formed in 1861. The idea of a federated national body for enginemen was first proposed at a Victorian Conference of locomotive associations in 1886, which eventually occurred at the turn of the century with the formation of the Federated Locomotive Enginemen's Association of Australasia. This was renamed the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen in 1920. The Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers\u2019 Association opted not to ballot its members on whether to amalgamate into the industry-wide VRU in 1911. The Association and later Victorian AFULE therefore remained a separate union from the ARU in Victoria for most of the 20th century. In 1993 the AFULE in Victoria and all other states and territories except Queensland voted to amalgamate into the PTU.<ref>\"History\", Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Employees website, http://www.afule.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=18</ref><ref>\u201cLocomotive Engine Drivers & Firemens Association (1872\u20131900)\u201d, Australian Trade Union Archives, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE1139b.htm</ref><ref>\u201cHistory\u201d, Rail, Tram & Bus Union Victorian Locomotive Division website, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbuvicloco.com.au/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629200850/http://www.rtbuvicloco.com.au/history.html |archive-date=29 June 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\">In the Service?, p 27.</ref>\n \n== History ==\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nThe development of rail lines in Victoria began around the middle of the 19th century, with the state government monopolising control of the railways in 1856.<ref>In the Service?, p 5.</ref> Significant expansion of railroads in the 1880s lead to a surge of those employed on the railway lines, including engine drivers, station masters and staff, clerks, labourers and gangers. These workers soon organised themselves into employees\u2019 associations and [[Craft unionism|craft unions]] (i.e. unions representing workers of a particular skill-set or grade, often within the same industry).\n\n=== Victorian Railways Union ===\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the existence of separate craft unions for employees in the Victorian railways was the norm, with train drivers and crew, signalmen, shunters, station masters, staff and rail labourers all organised into different unions based on their grade of work.<ref>In the Service?, p 19.</ref> That owed a great deal to the hierarchical nature of employment on the railways, with differences being especially pronounced between locomotive drivers, station staff and clerks, and \"unskilled\" workers. That invariably led to different scales of pay and complex bargaining for different groups of workers, and convinced many of the need for an industry-wide union. The first attempt at a united union occurred in 1884, when rail labourers formed an all-grades Mutual Services Association.<ref>In the Service?</ref> Labourers were the lowest-paid workers in the railways and hence the most committed to the benefits of an industry-wide union, but [[Craft unionism|entrenched divisions]] between grades of workers made most other rail employees hesitant to join. The Association renamed itself the Amalgamated Society of Railway Employees (ASRE) in 1900.<ref>In the Service?, p 20.</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the 1890s Depression, and its effects upon their wages and security of work, the attitude of rail employees towards an industry-wide union began to shift. In 1903, the government of conservative Premier [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] sought to stifle the electoral threat of rail workers\u2019 anger at pay cuts by passing of the Separate Representation Act. The Act barred railway employees from voting in their own electorates, instead being allotted two separate seats in [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|State Parliament's lower house]]. The ensuing campaign to repeal the Act galvanised rail workers\u2019 commitment to unionism and bolstered the ASRE's ranks.<ref>In the Service?, p 25-26.</ref> In July 1911, after a ballot of members on the question of an industry-wide union which resulted in a strongly affirmative opinion, the ASRE and all other craft unions in the railways, with the exception of the locomotive drivers' association, combined to form the Victorian Railways Union (VRU).<ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\"/> The VRU later became the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union (ARU) when railways unions from each state and territory unified nationally in 1921.<ref>\"Victorian Railways Union (1911\u20131921)\", Australian Trade Union Archives, last modified 12 December 2002, http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0926b.htm</ref>\n\nThe VRU's first Secretary was Frank Hyett, an ardent socialist who, despite lacking a personal background in the railways, quickly established himself as an able and dedicated organiser for the union, proving highly effective in uniting the different associations and craft unions into the VRU.<ref name=\"In the Service?, p 27\"/>  The ''Gazette'', which was the newspaper of the VRU, and later the Victorian branch of the ARU, for nearly a century, carried the motto \u201cWork and vote for Socialism\u201d.<ref>In the Service?, \u2018Note on Sources\u2019.</ref>\n\nThe Victorian branch of the ARU was also notable for being one of the few left-wing unions in Australia to have been both captured and subsequently lost by anti-communist elements in the years leading up to the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955]]. A [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-dominated and anti-communist [[Industrial Groups|Industrial Group]] ticket, led by shunter Jim Neill, mounted a successful campaign to oust the incumbent [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA) leadership at branch elections in the early 1950s, with Neill supplanting J.J. Brown as State Secretary in 1954. However, Brown and the CPA militants succeeded in reclaiming the Victorian branch from the Groupers by 1955, after which the Victorian ARU remained firmly under left-wing control.<ref>In the Service?, p 128-131.</ref>\n\n=== Clarrie O\u2019Shea and 1969 General Strike ===\n\nOne of the greatest episodes of industrial unrest in the post-World War II history of Australia's union movement took place in 1969 following the arrest and jailing of ATMOEA Victorian Secretary, [[Clarrie O'Shea|Clarrie O\u2019Shea]] for refusal to pay penal fines incurred for striking.\n\nO\u2019Shea, a Maoist aligned with the [[Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist)|CPA (M-L)]], had pursued a campaign of consistent industrial militancy since being elected ATMOEA State Secretary in 1947 to defend and advance his members\u2019 wages and conditions, sick leave and benefits. The strikes and work stoppages this entailed incurred heavy penal fines on the ATMOEA under the penal section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act \u2013 this legislation had been introduced by the Commonwealth Government in 1951 in an effort to deter industrial action on the part of unions. Bans clauses introduced by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission also existed at this time to deter strike action.<ref name=\":2\">\"Clarrie O\u2019Shea \u2013 Hero or villain?\" http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/oshea.htm</ref>\n\nBy 1969 the Victorian ATMOEA had accrued more than $13000 in fines under the Act for striking and was ordered by the Commonwealth Industrial Court to pay over $8000 up front. Rather than pay the fines however O\u2019Shea refused to obey the Court's orders and repeatedly refused to accept its summonses.<ref name=\":2\" />  O\u2019Shea finally appeared at the Industrial Court in Melbourne on 15 May \u2013 on the day of his appearance over 5000 unionists marched to the Court in a rally organised by a committee of 27 \u201crebel\u201d left-wing unions in Victoria sympathetic to O\u2019Shea.<ref>\u201cAbolish the Penal Powers: Freedom Fight of \u201869\u201d.

Huge marches took place in every Australian city demanding O\u2019Shea's release and the abolition of the Commonwealth anti-strike clauses, with cities including Melbourne and Hobart being virtually ground to a halt. Sentiment against the penal powers was very strong in the union movement by this time, with unions across Australia owing more than $300000 in strike fines at the time of O\u2019Shea's jailing. On the sixth day of the general strike, Clarrie O\u2019Shea was finally released after the ATMOEA's outstanding fines were paid on behalf of an \"anonymous benefactor\" alleged to have won the NSW lottery, widely believed to have been acting on behalf of the federal government. Upon his release, O\u2019Shea said, \"My release is a great victory for workers...The infinite power of the workers when they are really aroused has frightened the life out of the government and the employers...\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe outcome of the general strike was a huge victory both for the ATMOEA and the Australian union movement \u2013 while bans clauses remain on the books of Commonwealth legislation, most of the anti-strike penal clauses were abolished in the ensuing years and as a consequence of the strike have never been invoked by the Commonwealth Government in any industrial dispute since.<ref>Heagney, M.E. \"How significant was the Clarrie O\u2019Shea case?\", Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, http://asslh.org.au/hummer/no-8/oshea-case/</ref>\n\n=== 1990 Melbourne tram dispute and lock-out ===\n\nIn 1989 the Victorian Cain Labor Government announced that it would seek to abolish all tram conductors as a cost-cutting measure as part of its effort to arrest the state's fiscal crisis. This was a huge blow for the Victorian ATMOEA, for whom tram conductors had been the backbone of the union and an iconic feature of Melbourne.\n\nAfter several months of ongoing campaigning against the planned abolitions, on 1 January tram drivers and conductors took control of their trams and began to operate them for free as a \u201cwork-in\u201d in protest against the State Government's plans. The State Government responded by cutting power to Melbourne's tram grid, leaving hundreds of trams grounded in the city's CBD between Elizabeth and Bourke Street. At the same time tramways workers occupied and took control of tram depots at Essendon, Brunswick and South Melbourne as part of their effort to demand that Premier John Cain and Transport Minister Jim Kennan to reverse their plans to abolish conductors. The dispute ultimately turned into a month-long lock-out \u2013 although Melbourne's tramways were left paralysed for the duration of the dispute, the abolition of conductors ultimately went ahead. Despite this the ATMOEA did win some concessions as a result of the dispute, with tram conductors being phased out gradually over an 8-year period and many being retrained as ticket inspectors.<ref>Wood, Katie, \u201cWorkers\u2019 power on Melbourne\u2019s trams\u201d, Red Flag, 11 March 2014, http://redflag.org.au/article/workers%E2%80%99-power-melbourne%E2%80%99s-trams</ref>\n\n=== Kennett era and privatisation ===\n\nVictoria's public transport unions suffered significant losses in size and industrial clout under the State Liberal Government of Jeff Kennett from 1992\u201399. Following his election as Premier Kennett pursued a strongly neo-liberal program of cost-cutting and privatisation of services purportedly to revive Victoria's flagging economy \u2013 this took the form of drastically cutting back and de-regulating Victoria's public transport sector, with the sacking of 16,000 public transport workers, the closure and scaling back of several train lines and the eventual privatisation of Victoria's public transport system in 1999 all taking place.<ref>Carey, Adam. \u201cTransport companies suck $2.6 billion\u201d.

These cutbacks in Victoria and throughout Australia were key to these unions\u2019 decision to amalgamate.\n\nIt was also during the 1990s that control of the Victorian ARU began to change hands from the old CPA-aligned leadership to a new group of union activists based around the Rank-and-File Committee ticket. The Victorian ATMOEA experienced parallel changes, with control of the state branch swinging from its old guard Maoist leadership to a moderate-leaning ticket around this time.\n\n=== Amalgamation ===\n\nIn 1993, Australia's public transport unions resolved that the impact of changes in the public transport industry was such that it would be to their members\u2019 benefit to amalgamate into a single union. The national and state branches of the ARU, ATMOEA, AFULE and NURWA consequently balloted their members on the question as to whether they favoured amalgamation, in which over 85% of their combined members voted \u2018Yes\u2019. As a result, these unions amalgamated into a single Public Transport Union (PTU) in February 1993.<ref>RTBU National Website, \u201cA Short History of the RTBU\u201d, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223072150/http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe first State Secretary of the Victorian branch of the PTU was former ARU Branch Secretary Peter Bourke. The need for unity within the newly formed PTU in Victoria was paramount, with each amalgamating union bringing with it a strong desire to maintain autonomy from one-another that might have been an obstacle to unity. Despite these challenges the State Branch's leadership proved successful in making the PTU into a coherent union representing the interests of its members in all areas of public transport.\n\nThe PTU and its amalgamated divisions continued to suffer declining membership throughout the 1990s due to job losses in public transport in all states and territories. Despite the downturn of this period the PTU in Victoria was still able to accomplish significant industrial action, most notably a 48-hour strike during the 1997 Grand Prix weekend in protest at State Government plans to dissolve the Public Transport Corporation.<ref>\"Melbourne transport workers strike\", Green Left Weekly, https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/15305</ref>\n\n=== Renamed RTBU ===\n\nIn March 1998 the PTU chose to rename itself the Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union (RTBU) to reflect the privatisation of numerous public transport services in Australia.<ref>\u201cA Short History of the RTBU\u201d, {{cite web|url=http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223072150/http://www.rtbu-nat.asn.au/242.html |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df= }}</ref> Since the 2000s the RTBU in Victoria has been able to gradually rebuild its membership from the Kennett years.

However they also engage in proselytizing activities, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another ''[[mahram]]'') on proselytizing trips.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09>{{cite web |last1=De F\u00e9o |first1=Agn\u00e8s |title=Behind the Veil, In the Ranks of the Tablighi Jamaat |url=http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |publisher=World Religion Watch |accessdate=23 January 2016 |date=12 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094407/http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09/>\n\nAccording to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf,<ref name=womenbm/> the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

I walked into a little drugstore, and Eli was sitting there having a bite to eat...\"\n\nEsper talked to the actor, and Wallach told him he had studied at [[Sanford Meisner]]'s [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]]. After graduating [[Case Western Reserve University]] in his native [[Ohio]], Esper moved to [[New York City]] and began studying with Meisner, who was famous for his repetition exercise.<ref>[http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/features/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878362&imw=Y ''Backstage Magazine'' NY feature on Studio]</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Esper undertook training as a teacher and director with Meisner and proceeded to work closely with him for the next 15 years. Esper was on the staff of the Neighborhood Playhouse from 1965 to 1977 and Associate Director of the Playhouse Acting Department from 1974 to 1977.\n\nIn 1977 Esper also founded the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] Professional Actor Training Programs at [[Rutgers University]]'s [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]].

Together with his wife Suzanne Esper, who also teaches at Esper Studios, he has conducted numerous workshops throughout Europe,  most notably at the [[National Film School of Denmark]], the [[Norwegian National Academy of Theatre]], and the [[National Theatre Mannheim]]. In 2008 Bill and Suzanne Esper introduced Meisner's work to Russia at the St. Petersburg State Academy of Theater.\n\nEsper has worked extensively [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Regional theater in the United States|regionally]].  He is a member of [[Ensemble Studio Theatre]] in New York. He was profiled in the book ''The New Generation of Acting Teachers'', published by [[Viking Press]] in 1987.

It admitted Catholics to the practice of law, permitted the exercise of their religion, and the existence of their schools. On the other hand, chapels, schools, officiating priests and teachers were to be registered, assemblies with locked doors, as well as steeples and bells to chapels, were forbidden; priests were not to wear vestments or celebrate liturgies in the open air; children of [[Protestant]]s were not to be admitted to the schools; monastic orders and endowments of schools and colleges were prohibited.\n\nThe sentiment for reform was helped along by the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]] in France in 1787, whereby non-Catholic French subjects were given full legal status in a kingdom where Catholicism had always been the [[state religion]]. \n\n==Terms==\nIt was far more extensive and far-reaching than its predecessor, the [[Papists Act 1778]]. By it there was again an oath to be taken, in character much like that of 1778, but including an engagement to support the Protestant Succession under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].  No Catholic taking the oath was henceforward to be prosecuted for being a [[Papist]], or for being educated in Catholicism, or for hearing [[Catholic Mass]] or saying it, or for being a priest or [[deacon]] or for entering into, or belonging to, any ecclesiastical order or community in the Church of Rome, or for assisting at, or performing any Catholic rites or ceremonies. Catholics were no longer to be summoned to take the Oath of Supremacy, or to be removed from London; the legislation of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], requiring them to register their estates and wills, was absolutely repealed; while the professions of counsellor and barrister at law, attorney, solicitor, and [[Notary public|notary]] were opened to them.<ref name=Gerard>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13123a.htm Gerard, John, and Edward D'Alton. \"Roman Catholic Relief Bill.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13.

It admitted Catholics to the practice of law, permitted the exercise of their religion, and the existence of their schools. On the other hand, chapels, schools, officiating priests and teachers were to be registered, assemblies with locked doors, as well as steeples and bells to chapels, were forbidden; priests were not to wear vestments or celebrate liturgies in the open air; children of [[Protestant]]s were not to be admitted to the schools; monastic orders and endowments of schools and colleges were prohibited.\n\nThe sentiment for reform was helped along by the signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]] in France in 1787, whereby non-Catholic French subjects were given full legal status in a kingdom where Catholicism had always been the [[state religion]]. \n\n==Terms==\nIt was far more extensive and far-reaching than its predecessor, the [[Papists Act 1778]]. By it there was again an oath to be taken, in character much like that of 1778, but including an engagement to support the Protestant Succession under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].  No Catholic taking the oath was henceforward to be prosecuted for being a [[Papist]], or for being educated in Catholicism, or for hearing [[Catholic Mass]] or saying it, or for being a priest or [[deacon]] or for entering into, or belonging to, any ecclesiastical order or community in the Church of Rome, or for assisting at, or performing any Catholic rites or ceremonies. Catholics were no longer to be summoned to take the Oath of Supremacy, or to be removed from London; the legislation of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], requiring them to register their estates and wills, was absolutely repealed; while the professions of counsellor and barrister at law, attorney, solicitor, and [[Notary public|notary]] were opened to them.<ref name=Gerard>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13123a.htm Gerard, John, and Edward D'Alton. \"Roman Catholic Relief Bill.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13.

The spelling \"liter\" is predominantly used in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]].{{Efn|The Metric Conversion Act of 1985 gives the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the United States. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]). In 2008, the NIST published the U.S. version ([http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (BIPM) publication {{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me International d' Unit\u00e9s (SI)}} ([http://www1.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8.pdf BIPM, 2006]). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf Taylor and Thompson, 2008a], p. iii). The Director of the NIST officially recognized this publication, together with [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor and Thompson (2008b)], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).}}\n\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ({{val|0|u=degC}}). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1000&nbsp;litres of water has a mass of about 1000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show that it has a density of {{val|0.999975|0.000001|u=kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05).</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

A [[mnemonic]] for its volume relative to an imperial pint is \"a litre of water's a pint and three quarters\"; this is very close, as a litre is actually 1.75975399&nbsp;pints.\n\nA litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10&nbsp;cm, which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4&nbsp;inches (one-third of a foot). One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27&nbsp;litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592&nbsp;litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27-litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter [[L#Forms_and_variants|\"l\"]]. In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]].</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton).

Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs ({{lang-de|Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge}}) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]], or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1000&nbsp;litres of water has a mass of about 1000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show that it has a density of {{val|0.999975|0.000001|u=kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05).</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

A [[mnemonic]] for its volume relative to an imperial pint is \"a litre of water's a pint and three quarters\"; this is very close, as a litre is actually 1.75975399&nbsp;pints.\n\nA litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10&nbsp;cm, which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4&nbsp;inches (one-third of a foot). One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27&nbsp;litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592&nbsp;litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27-litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter \"l\". In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]]</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton). In 1990, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre.<ref name=\"BIPM2006-brochure\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\nPrior to 1979, the symbol <span style=\"font-size:112%\">{{Litre}}</span> came into common use in some countries;{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} for example, it was recommended by [[South African Bureau of Standards]] publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s.

This made the original litre {{val|1.000974}} of today's cubic decimetre. It was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed.\n\nIn 1879, the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures|CIPM]] adopted the definition of the litre, with the symbol '''l''' (lowercase letter L).\n\nIn 1901, at the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1&nbsp;kg of pure [[water]] at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C) under a pressure of 1&nbsp;[[Standard atmospheric pressure|atm]]. This made the litre equal to about {{val|1.000028|u=dm3}} (earlier reference works usually put it at {{val|1.000027|u=dm3}}).\n\nIn 1964, at the 12th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the original definition was reverted to, and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre, as another name for the cubic decimetre, that is, exactly 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=NIST, 2000 |publisher=Ts.nist.gov |accessdate=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210164956/http://ts.nist.gov/weightsandmeasures/publications/appxc.cfm |archivedate=10 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, at the 16th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the alternative symbol '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted.

The abbreviation \"cc\" is still commonly used in many fields including medical dosage and sizing for [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] [[engine displacement|displacement]].\n\nThe microlitre (\u03bcL) has been known in the past as the [[Lambda (unit)|lambda]] (\u03bb), but this usage is now discouraged.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carl A. |last1=Burtis |first2=David E. |last2=Bruns |year=2014 |title=Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics |edition=7. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323292061 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7XwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |pages=114}}</ref> In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as '''mcL''' on test results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Units of Measurement - Mayo Medical Laboratories|url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/appendix/measurement.html|website=www.mayomedicallaboratories.com|accessdate=23 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[SI]] system, use of prefixes for powers of 1,000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}<!-- is this true?? --> In countries where \nthe [[metric system]] was established well before the adoption of the [[SI]] standard other multiples were already established, their use remains common. In particular, use of the \"centi\" (10<sup>\u22122</sup>), \"deci\" (10<sup>\u22121</sup>), \"deca\" (10<sup>+1</sup>) and \"hecto\" (10<sup>+2</sup>) prefixes are still common.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of [[beverages]] (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in [[Switzerland]] and [[Scandinavia]] and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Belgium]], a \"vijfentwintiger\" and a \"drie\u00ebndertiger\" (literally \"twenty-fiver\" and \"thirty-threer\") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL or 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for 'artisanal' brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the [[SI]] standard was established, common usage more closely follows contemporary [[SI]] conventions. For example, in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} An exception is in pathology, where for instance [[blood lead level]] may be measured in micrograms per decilitre.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1&nbsp;kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAlthough kilolitres, megalitres, and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, for larger volumes of fluids, such as annual consumption of tap water, lorry (truck) tanks, or swimming pools, the [[cubic metre]] is the general unit.
