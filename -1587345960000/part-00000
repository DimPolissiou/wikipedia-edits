It was a low budget, production line number for the [[Nikkatsu]] Company, originally released in a [[Double feature|double bill]] with [[Sh\u014dgor\u014d Nishimura]]'s ''[[Burning Nature]]''. The story follows Goro Hanada in his life as a contract killer. He falls in love with a woman named Misako, who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his sanity as much as his life.\n\nThe studio was unhappy with the original script and called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct it at the last minute. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas the night before or on the set while [[Filmmaking|filming]], and welcomed ideas from his collaborators. He gave the film a [[Satire|satirical]], anarchic and visually eclectic bent which the studio had previously warned him away from. It was a commercial and critical disappointment and Suzuki was ostensibly fired for making \"movies that make no sense and no money\".<ref name=\"Branded to Kill DVD\"/> Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu with support from student groups, like-minded filmmakers and the general public and caused a major controversy through the Japanese film industry. Suzuki was [[blacklist]]ed and did not make another feature film for 10 years but became a [[counterculture]] hero.<ref name=\"Sato\"/>\n\nThe film grew a strong following, which expanded overseas in the 1980s, and has established itself as a [[Cult film|cult classic]]. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] [[masterpiece]].<ref name=\"Volcano\"/> It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[John Woo]], [[Chan-wook Park]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]], and composer [[John Zorn]].<ref name=\"Zorn\">{{cite web\n| last = John\n| first = Zorn\n| title = Branded to Kill\n| publisher = Criterion\n| date = February 1999\n| url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/47-branded-to-kill\n| accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref> Thirty-four years after ''Branded to Kill'', Suzuki filmed ''[[Pistol Opera]]'' (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major [[retrospective]]s spotlighting his career.\n\n==Plot==\nGoro Hanada, the Japanese underworld's third-ranked hitman, and his wife, Mami, fly into [[Tokyo]] and are met by Kasuga, a formerly ranked hitman turned taxi driver. Kasuga petitions Hanada to assist him in breaking back into the profession. Hanada agrees and the three go to a club owned by the [[yakuza]] boss Michihiko Yabuhara. The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]]. After the meeting, Yabuhara covertly seduces Hanada's wife.\n\nHanada and Kasuga pick up a car designated for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a [[Death drive|deathwish]], stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.\n\n[[Image:Annu Mari and Jo Shishido in Branded to Kill.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=A shirtless man shouts at a woman.

Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts his way into the third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.\n\nDuring the job a [[butterfly]] lands on the barrel of his rifle causing him to miss his target and kill an innocent bystander. Misako tells him that he will now lose his rank and be killed. Hanada makes plans to leave the country but is shot by his wife, who then sets fire to their apartment and flees. His belt buckle, however, stopped the bullet and he escapes the building.\n\nHe finds Misako and they go to her apartment. After alternating failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other, she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, he finds he cannot as he has fallen in love with her. In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out on the side of the road. The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet hole through the centre of his forehead.\n\nHanada returns to Misako's apartment where a film projector has been set up. It depicts Misako bound and tortured and directs him to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], where the following day he is to be killed. Hanada submits to the demand but kills the killers instead. The former client arrives and announces himself as the legendary Number One Killer. He says he will kill Hanada but, in thanks for the work he has done, is only giving a warning at present.\n\nHanada holes up in Misako's apartment and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening phone calls and forbidding him to leave the apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.\n\nAt the apartment, Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One stating he will be waiting at a [[gym]]nasium with Misako. Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show. As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave, a tape recorder switches on explaining, \"This is the way Number One works\", he exhausts you and then kills you. Hanada puts a headband across his forehead and climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire. Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying. Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One. Misako enters the gym, and Hanada instinctively shoots her dead, again declares himself Number One, then falls out of the ring.<ref name=\"Yakuza Book\">{{cite book|last=Schilling |first=Mark |title=The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |date=September 2003 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |pages=98\u2013104 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Shishido]] as Goro Hanada, the Number Three Killer: a hitman with a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for the smell of boiling rice.

Animated [[starling]]s, rain and butterflies mask the screen, accompanied by corresponding [[sound effect]]s.]]\n\nThe film industry is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese [[censorship]] often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design.<ref name=\"Rayns\"/> In the story, after Hanada finds he is unable to kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Ky\u016bsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a \"top professional.\"<ref name=\"Teo\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in black and white Nikkatsuscope (synonymous with [[CinemaScope]] at a 2.35:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]). Due to the wide frame, moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and [[chiaroscuro]] imagery to create excitement and suspense.

It was a low budget, production line number for the [[Nikkatsu]] Company, originally released in a [[Double feature|double bill]] with [[Sh\u014dgor\u014d Nishimura]]'s ''[[Burning Nature]]''. The story follows Goro Hanada in his life as a contract killer. He falls in love with a woman named Misako, who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his sanity as much as his life.\n\nThe studio was unhappy with the original script and called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct it at the last minute. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas the night before or on the set while [[Filmmaking|filming]], and welcomed ideas from his collaborators. He gave the film a [[Satire|satirical]], anarchic and visually eclectic bent which the studio had previously warned him away from. It was a commercial and critical disappointment and Suzuki was ostensibly fired for making \"movies that make no sense and no money\".<ref name=\"Branded to Kill DVD\"/> Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu with support from student groups, like-minded filmmakers and the general public and caused a major controversy through the Japanese film industry. Suzuki was [[blacklist]]ed and did not make another feature film for 10 years but became a [[counterculture]] hero.<ref name=\"Sato\"/>\n\nThe film grew a strong following, which expanded overseas in the 1980s, and has established itself as a [[Cult film|cult classic]]. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] [[masterpiece]].<ref name=\"Volcano\"/> It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[John Woo]], [[Chan-wook Park]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]], and composer [[John Zorn]].<ref name=\"Zorn\">{{cite web\n| last = John\n| first = Zorn\n| title = Branded to Kill\n| publisher = Criterion\n| date = February 1999\n| url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/47-branded-to-kill\n| accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref> Thirty-four years after ''Branded to Kill'', Suzuki filmed ''[[Pistol Opera]]'' (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major [[retrospective]]s spotlighting his career.\n\n==Plot==\nGoro Hanada, the Japanese underworld's third-ranked hitman, and his wife, Mami, fly into [[Tokyo]] and are met by Kasuga, a formerly ranked hitman turned taxi driver. Kasuga petitions Hanada to assist him in breaking back into the profession. Hanada agrees and the three go to a club owned by the [[yakuza]] boss Michihiko Yabuhara. The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]]. After the meeting, Yabuhara covertly seduces Hanada's wife.\n\nHanada and Kasuga pick up a car designated for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a [[Death drive|deathwish]], stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.\n\n[[Image:Annu Mari and Jo Shishido in Branded to Kill.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=A shirtless man shouts at a woman.

Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts his way into the third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.\n\nDuring the job a [[butterfly]] lands on the barrel of his rifle causing him to miss his target and kill an innocent bystander. Misako tells him that he will now lose his rank and be killed. Hanada makes plans to leave the country but is shot by his wife, who then sets fire to their apartment and flees. His belt buckle, however, stopped the bullet and he escapes the building.\n\nHe finds Misako and they go to her apartment. After alternating failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other, she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, he finds he cannot as he has fallen in love with her. In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out on the side of the road. The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet hole through the centre of his forehead.\n\nHanada returns to Misako's apartment where a film projector has been set up. It depicts Misako bound and tortured and directs him to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], where the following day he is to be killed. Hanada submits to the demand but kills the killers instead. The former client arrives and announces himself as the legendary Number One Killer. He says he will kill Hanada but, in thanks for the work he has done, is only giving a warning at present.\n\nHanada holes up in Misako's apartment and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening phone calls and forbidding him to leave the apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.\n\nAt the apartment, Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One stating he will be waiting at a [[gym]]nasium with Misako. Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show. As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave, a tape recorder switches on explaining, \"This is the way Number One works\", he exhausts you and then kills you. Hanada puts a headband across his forehead and climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire. Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying. Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One. Misako enters the arena and, crazed, he instinctively shoots her dead, then falls from the ring.<ref name=\"Yakuza Book\">{{cite book|last=Schilling |first=Mark |title=The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |date=September 2003 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |pages=98\u2013104 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Shishido]] as Goro Hanada, the Number Three Killer: a hitman with a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for the smell of boiling rice.

Animated [[starling]]s, rain and butterflies mask the screen, accompanied by corresponding [[sound effect]]s.]]\n\nThe film industry is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese [[censorship]] often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design.<ref name=\"Rayns\"/> In the story, after Hanada finds he is unable to kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Ky\u016bsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a \"top professional.\"<ref name=\"Teo\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in black and white Nikkatsuscope (synonymous with [[CinemaScope]] at a 2.35:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]). Due to the wide frame, moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and [[chiaroscuro]] imagery to create excitement and suspense. Conventional framing and [[film grammar]] were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration.

A sequel, ''[[Trolls World Tour]]'', was released on April 10, 2020.\n\n==Plot==   \n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nThe Trolls are small, colorful creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing, hugging, and having fun all day. However, they are discovered by the ''Bergens'', large, ugly, miserable creatures who can only feel happy by consuming a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called \"Trollstice\". The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his infant daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through tunnels on the day of Trollstice when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.\u2019s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself, while secretly plotting to overthrow the monarchy as revenge for her exile.\n\nTwenty years later, the now-adult Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. At the party, Branch's warnings come true when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Poppy's friends, including a \"Zen\" troll named Creek, whom Poppy is in love with.\n\nPoppy decides on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture towards Bergen Town, and is later joined by Branch who saves her from a group of spiders. Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness the now-King Gristle Jr. seemingly eat Creek, but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.\n\nWhile setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got eaten while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef, and that his guilt caused his color to turn from blue to gray. After Poppy comforts him with a hug, the trolls help Bridget, disguised under the name of \"Lady Glittersparkles\", gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a [[roller rink]] and [[amusement arcade|arcade restaurant]] and Gristle Jr. agrees for her to come to Trollstice. During this time, Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.\n\nHaving helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, and Poppy gets shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village (via Poppy's cowbell) and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy falls into despair and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.\n\nBranch tries to sing \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" for Poppy to cheer her up, confessing his love for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns his feelings, and they restore all the trolls' colors, including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy can't bring herself to abandon Bridget and, with Branch and her friends, shows Gristle Jr. and the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves.\n\nThe vengeful Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart, set on fire, and sent rolling out of Bergen Town with Creek, who is still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a friendly hug.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling. Chef prepares to eat Creek herself, but they soon find out they are on top of a monster, who opens his mouth and eats them both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|direction = horizontal\n|image1    = Anna Kendrick Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width1    = 149\n|alt1      = Anna Kendrick\n|image2    = Justin Timberlake Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width2    = 130\n|alt2      = Justin Timberlake\n|footer    = Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake at the film's preview at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|last2=Miller|first2=Julie|title=What Happened When Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, and Trolls Came to Cannes|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/anna-kendrick-justin-timberlake-trolls-cannes|accessdate=July 24, 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=May 12, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Poppy, the princess, and later queen, of the Trolls.   <ref name=DeadlineTimberlake /><ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=119556 |title=Anna Kendrick to Voice DreamWorks Animation's Trolls |publisher=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"twitter1\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AnnaKendrick47/status/684782188907237376 |title=Hair we go!

A sequel, ''[[Trolls World Tour]]'', was released on April 10, 2020.\n\n==Plot==   \n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nThe Trolls are small, colorful creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing, hugging, and having fun all day. However, they are discovered by the ''Bergens'', large, ugly, miserable creatures who can only feel happy by consuming a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called \"Trollstice\". The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his infant daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through tunnels on the day of Trollstice when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.\u2019s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself, while secretly plotting to overthrow the monarchy as revenge for her exile.\n\nTwenty years later, the now-adult Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. At the party, Branch's warnings come true when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Poppy's friends, including a \"Zen\" troll named Creek, whom Poppy is in love with.\n\nPoppy decides on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture towards Bergen Town, and is later joined by Branch who saves her from a group of spiders. Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness the now-King Gristle Jr. seemingly eat Creek, but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.\n\nWhile setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got eaten while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef, and that his guilt caused his color to turn from blue to gray. After Poppy comforts him with a hug, the trolls help Bridget, disguised under the name of \"Lady Glittersparkles\", gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a [[roller rink]] and [[amusement arcade|arcade restaurant]] and Gristle Jr. agrees for her to come to Trollstice. During this time, Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.\n\nHaving helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, and Poppy gets shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village (via Poppy's cowbell) and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy falls into despair and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.\n\nBranch tries to sing \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" for Poppy to cheer her up, confessing his love for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns his feelings, and they restore all the trolls' colors, including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy can't bring herself to abandon Bridget and, with Branch and her friends, shows Gristle Jr. and the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves.\n\nThe vengeful Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart, set on fire, and sent rolling out of Bergen Town with Creek, who is still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a friendly hug.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling.

The game, which is a direct sequel to the Japan-exclusive [[Nintendo DS]] title ''[[Tomodachi Collection]]'', was released in Japan in April 2013, June 2014 worldwide and July 2014 in South Korea. The game received positive reviews and good sales records. Many reviewers praised the gameplay but criticised the minigames. Its name means ''Friend Life''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{see also|Tomodachi Collection#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Tomodachi Collection}}\n{{Unreferenced section |date=December 2019}}\n\nThe game begins with the player naming their island and creating or importing their personal [[Mii]], who is referred to as the player's \"look-alike\" and lives in an apartment building. The building holds up to 100 Miis (or more depending on the date of the release of your copy).\n\n[[File:TomodachiLifeGameplayHusbandwifebaby.jpg|thumb|The player visits a married couple's house, where they can be seen playing with their baby.]]\n\nThe player can import Miis from the system's Mii Maker, other devices or QR codes or create them from scratch using the 3DS's camera or the in-game Mii Maker. The Miis are voiced by a [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech software]] and have unique personalities. Miis can then perform various actions, such as eating, trying on different outfits, falling in love with each other, and engaging in many leisure activities. As more Miis are added to the island, many strange and curious interactions can occur between them, such as friendship, romance, rivalry, romantic relationships and families.  As the game goes by, the player unlocks more stores, clothes, food, and places for the Miis to play. They can even unlock a port, where they can give and \"trade\" goods with other islands.\n\n== Development ==\nIn May 2014, a playable demo of the game was distributed to Platinum members of [[Club Nintendo]] in North America, the data of which could be transferred to the final version to unlock a bonus in-game item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/club_nintendo_distributing_tomodachi_life_demo_codes_to_select_platinum_members |title=Club Nintendo Distributing Tomodachi Life Demo Codes to Select Platinum Members - 3DS News @ Nintendo Life |publisher=Nintendolife.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> The game is bundled with two [[Nintendo eShop]] download codes for a 'Welcome version' demo, which can be given to friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2014/05/21/tomodachi-life-comes-2-free-demos-give-friends |title=Tomodachi Life Comes With 2 Free Demos to Give to Friends |last=MacDonald |first=Keza |publisher=Kotaku UK |date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> A slightly different demo version was later publicly released for download via the Nintendo eShop.

The game, which is a direct sequel to the Japan-exclusive [[Nintendo DS]] title ''[[Tomodachi Collection]]'', was released in Japan in April 2013, June 2014 worldwide and July 2014 in South Korea. The game received positive reviews and good sales records. Many reviewers praised the gameplay but criticised the minigames. Its name means ''Friend Life''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{see also|Tomodachi Collection#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Tomodachi Collection}}\n{{Unreferenced section |date=December 2019}}\n\nThe game begins with the player naming their island and creating or importing their personal [[Mii]], who is referred to as the player's \"look-alike\" and lives in an apartment building. The building holds up to 100 Miis (or more depending on the date of the release of your copy).\n\n[[File:TomodachiLifeGameplayHusbandwifebaby.jpg|thumb|The player visits a married couple's house, where they can be seen playing with their baby.]]\n\nThe player can import Miis from the system's Mii Maker, other devices or QR codes or create them from scratch using the 3DS's camera or the in-game Mii Maker. The Miis are voiced by a [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech software]] and have unique personalities. Miis can then perform various actions, such as eating, trying on different outfits, falling in love with each other, and engaging in many leisure activities. As more Miis are added to the island, many strange and curious interactions can occur between them, such as friendship, romance, rivalry, romantic relationships and families.  As the game goes by, the player unlocks more stores, clothes, food, and places for the Miis to play. They can even unlock a port, where they can give and \"trade\" goods with other islands.\n\n== Development ==\nIn May 2014, a playable demo of the game was distributed to Platinum members of [[Club Nintendo]] in North America, the data of which could be transferred to the final version to unlock a bonus in-game item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/club_nintendo_distributing_tomodachi_life_demo_codes_to_select_platinum_members |title=Club Nintendo Distributing Tomodachi Life Demo Codes to Select Platinum Members - 3DS News @ Nintendo Life |publisher=Nintendolife.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> The game is bundled with two [[Nintendo eShop]] download codes for a 'Welcome version' demo, which can be given to friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2014/05/21/tomodachi-life-comes-2-free-demos-give-friends |title=Tomodachi Life Comes With 2 Free Demos to Give to Friends |last=MacDonald |first=Keza |publisher=Kotaku UK |date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> A slightly different demo version was later publicly released for download via the Nintendo eShop.
