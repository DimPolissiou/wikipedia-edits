{"title_page": "Quasiparticle", "text_new": "{{short description|Emergent phenomena}}\nIn [[physics]], '''quasiparticles''' and '''collective excitations''' (which are closely related) are [[emergent phenomena]] that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a [[solid]] behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting [[particle]]s in [[free space]]. For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]]. This \"electron with a different mass\" is called an \"electron quasiparticle\".<ref name=Kaxiras/> In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]] or a hole band in a metal<ref name=\"ashcroftandmermin\">{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=978-0030839931|pages=[https://archive.org/details/solidstatephysic00ashc/page/299 299\u2013302]|edition=1st|accessdate=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/solidstatephysic00ashc/page/299}}</ref> is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called [[electron hole]]s. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.\n\nThese particles are typically called \"quasiparticles\" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called \"collective excitations\" if they are related to [[boson]]s,<ref name=Kaxiras/> although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name=Mattuck>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&pg=PA10 \t''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. \"As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously.\"</ref> Thus, electrons and [[electron hole]]s are typically called \"quasiparticles\", while phonons and plasmons are typically called \"collective excitations\".\n\nThe quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===General introduction===\n[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).\n\nMotion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''real'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.\n\nIn summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.\n\n===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===\n[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]\nThe principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10<sup>17</sup> nuclei and 10<sup>18</sup> electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In principle, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in this case is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) on a 3\u00d710<sup>18</sup>-dimensional vector space\u2014one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3\u00d710<sup>18</sup>-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.\n\nOne simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the \"low-lying\" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.\n\nQuasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ohtsu |first1=Motoichi |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Kiyoshi |last3=Kawazoe |first3=Tadashi |last4=Yatsui |first4=Takashi |last5=Naruse |first5=Makoto |title=Principles of Nanophotonics |date=2008 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781584889731 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&pg=PA205 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen the material is characterized as having \"several elementary excitations\", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as \"phonon-phonon [[scattering]]\".\n\nTherefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10<sup>18</sup> particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.\n\n===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===\nUsually, an elementary excitation is called a \"quasiparticle\" if it is a [[fermion]] and a \"collective excitation\" if it is a [[boson]].<ref name=\"Kaxiras\" /> However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name=\"Mattuck\" />\n\nThere is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.<ref name=Mattuck/> A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: it is built around a real particle at its \"core\", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the \"electron quasiparticle\": an electron in a crystal behaves as if it had an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] which differs from its real mass. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its \"core\". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.\n\nHowever, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions.

In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard [[collision]]s between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the [[entropy]] production, and generally take the form of a [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann]]-type collision term, in which figure only \"far collisions\" between virtual particles.

For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]].

Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.\n\nThese particles are typically called \"quasiparticles\" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called \"collective excitations\" if they are related to [[boson]]s,<ref name=Kaxiras/> although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name=Mattuck>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&pg=PA10 \t''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. \"As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously.\"</ref> Thus, electrons and [[electron hole]]s are typically called \"quasiparticles\", while phonons and plasmons are typically called \"collective excitations\".\n\nThe quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===General introduction===\n[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).\n\nMotion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''real'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.\n\nIn summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.\n\n===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===\n[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]\nThe principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10<sup>17</sup> nuclei and 10<sup>18</sup> electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In principle, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in this case is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) on a 3\u00d710<sup>18</sup>-dimensional vector space\u2014one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3\u00d710<sup>18</sup>-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.\n\nOne simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the \"low-lying\" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.\n\nQuasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ohtsu |first1=Motoichi |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Kiyoshi |last3=Kawazoe |first3=Tadashi |last4=Yatsui |first4=Takashi |last5=Naruse |first5=Makoto |title=Principles of Nanophotonics |date=2008 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781584889731 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&pg=PA205 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen the material is characterized as having \"several elementary excitations\", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as \"phonon-phonon [[scattering]]\".\n\nTherefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10<sup>18</sup> particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.\n\n===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===\nUsually, an elementary excitation is called a \"quasiparticle\" if it is a [[fermion]] and a \"collective excitation\" if it is a [[boson]].<ref name=\"Kaxiras\" /> However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name=\"Mattuck\" />\n\nThere is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.<ref name=Mattuck/> A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: it is built around a real particle at its \"core\", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the \"electron quasiparticle\": an electron in a crystal behaves as if it had an [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] which differs from its real mass. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its \"core\". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.\n\nHowever, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins.

For example, an '''exciton-polariton''' is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a '''phonon-polariton''' is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.\n*A '''[[plasmon]]''' is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of [[plasma oscillation]]s (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).\n*A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of its surrounding ions.\n*An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole bound together.\n*A '''plasmariton''' is a coupled optical phonon and dressed photon consisting of a plasmon and photon.\n\n===More specialized examples===\n*A '''[[roton]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the rotation of a fluid (often a [[superfluid]]).

Physical objects like impurity atoms, from which quasiparticles scatter in an ordinary metal, only weakly affect the energy of a Cooper pair in a conventional superconductor. In conventional superconductors, interference between Bogoliubov quasiparticles is tough for an STM to see. Because of their complex global electronic structures, however, high-Tc cuprate superconductors are another matter. Thus Davis and his colleagues were able to resolve distinctive patterns of quasiparticle interference in Bi-2212.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=J. E.
