His first name, the Greek form of [[Joseph]], is commonly represented in its [[Cretan Greek|Cretan]] [[diminutive]] ''Sifis'' (\"Joe\"), by which he is popularly known.\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born in 1943 in [[Chania]] on the island of [[Crete]]. His father, Ioannis Valirakis, was an officer in the [[Hellenic Army]] and a member of the [[Centre Union]] party. He studied electrical engineering in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], with a specialization in [[industrial automation]]. He speaks [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in addition to Greek.\n\n=== Anti-junta activity ===\nAs a leading member of the anti-junta resistance and of the armed branch of the [[Panhellenic Liberation Movement]] (he had training at a [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] camp in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]), Valirakis was wanted by the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]] for three years for [[Improvised explosive device|bombings]] and was finally apprehended in 1971 and jailed by the Special Investigative Section (ETA) of the [[Greek Military Police]] (ESA). Nevertheless, he escaped by cutting the bars of his cell and causing a [[short-circuit]] in the jail's electrical grid. He remained on the loose in [[Athens]] for fifteen days before fleeing his [[safe house]] for [[Patras]], where he hopped on the roof of a train that was heading to [[Yugoslavia]].

He avoided [[hypothermia]] by covering himself with [[butter]] stolen from a prison kitchen, and kept his clothes dry in a nylon bag. But when he got there, the regime  of [[Enver Hoxha]] thought that he was a spy for the Greek junta, and initially sentenced him to three years hard labour at a camp near [[Fier]]. The conditions at Fier were worse than the military prisons under the junta in Greece, and for fifteen days he was cold, over-worked and on [[punishment]], in which he was permitted fifteen [[gram]]mes of meat in the morning, his sole ration for each day in that period. However, he was fortunate at that time as [[Andreas Papandreou]] was mobilizing his contacts in the international [[Maoist]] and [[Sinophile]] movements \u2014 Albania at that time was a major satellite of Maoist China \u2014 to save him. At long last, the then-[[Prince#Prince as a reigning monarch|Sovereign Prince]] and once-and-future [[List of monarchs of Cambodia|King of Cambodia]], [[Norodom Sihanouk]], a close friend of Andreas Papandreou, intervened with the Chinese, who then intervened with the Albanians, and thus Sifis Valirakis was released.<ref name=\"protagon.gr\"/>\n\n=== Political career ===\nAfter the [[metapolitefsi|fall of the junta]], he was elected to parliament the first time for Andreas Papandreou's [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in 1977.
