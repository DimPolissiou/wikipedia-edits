Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

However the historicity of this account has been disputed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Andrew Jervise, \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns\"</ref>\n\nIn the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

Lee began his career as a musician at the age of 14 with the Sydney band [[Noise Addict]], but focused on his solo career when the band broke up in 1995. He appeared as the protagonist in the Australian film ''[[The Rage in Placid Lake]]'' (2003).<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/australian-singers-turned-actors/|title=Australian Singers Turned Actors|date=July 14, 2019}}</ref>  He has released eleven solo studio albums.\n\n==Career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Noise Addict===\nLee's musical career began in 1993 with the band [[Noise Addict]], who were signed to [[Steve Pavlovic]]'s independent label Fellaheen Records, on the strength of a self-produced and distributed four-track demo recorded in Lee's bedroom. Pavlovic's connections brought the band to the attention of [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Mike D (musician)|Mike D]], both of whom released the band's material in the US. The group put out several releases on the Beasties' [[Grand Royal Records]].\n\nThese including the acoustic ''Young and Jaded'' EP in 1994, which contained Lee's [[Evan Dando]] tribute, \"I Wish I Was Him\". In 1995, Grand Royal released the band's only full-length album, the [[Brad Wood]]-produced ''Meet the Real You''. Noise Addict made a music video for the song \"16\", toured with [[Sebadoh]], but then broke up. Lee was also briefly a member of the alternative act [[Gerling]]. In 2009 Lee recorded a new Noise Addict album, ''It Was Never About the Audience'', with a new lineup; [[Lou Barlow]] and [[Lara Meyerratken]].\n\n===Solo career===\nLee's solo career started at the age of 16, while he was still in Noise Addict. He began recording his first solo album, ''[[Grandpaw Would]]'', in both Sydney and [[Chicago]] with producer [[Brad Wood]]. This was followed by the 1997 album, ''[[Something to Remember Me By]]'', also produced by Wood. An alternate version of his song \"Burn to Shine\", produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]], played over the end credits of the film ''[[Best Men]]''. Lee was then featured on the ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' soundtrack, with the song \"How to Survive a Broken Heart\". 1998's ''[[Breathing Tornados]]'', released on Pavlovic's new label [[Modular Recordings|Modular]], marked a new direction for Lee as he introduced synthesisers and increased instrumentation into his sound.poo\n\nThe album was a success in Australia, earning Lee [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Award]] nominations for Best Male Artist and Album of the Year. The album's first single, \"[[Cigarettes Will Kill You]]\", was also nominated for Single of the Year and finished second in that year's [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1998|Triple J Hottest 100]]. In 2001, Lee contributed a track (\"Sweet Is the Night\") to a Jeff Lynne tribute album ''[[Lynne Me Your Ears]]''.\n\nLee's fourth album, ''[[Hey You. Yes You.|hey you. yes you.]]'', was released in 2002. The first single from the album, \"Something Borrowed, Something Blue\", reached number 67 on the [[ARIA Charts]] and number 22 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2002|2002's Triple J Hottest 100]]. The second single, \"Running with Scissors\", peaked at number 82 on the ARIA charts. In 2003, he also contributed several songs to the [[Evan Dando]] solo album ''Baby I'm Bored''.\n\nIn late 2004, Lee left Steve Pavlovic's [[Modular Recordings]] and started his own record label, Ten Fingers. The first release on the label was the single, \"[[Gamble Everything for Love]]\", followed by the album, ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' in February 2005, which went double platinum in Australia. A defining release in his career, the album showcased a much brighter, positive side of Lee's personality, in contrast to his previous darker musings. ''Awake Is the New Sleep'' received several nominations for the 2005 [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) awards, and Lee won Best Male Artist, Best Independent Release, and Single of the Year for \"[[Catch My Disease]]\", which Lee wrote with Mcgowan Southworth. \"Catch My Disease\" also went to No. 2 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2005|2005 Triple J Hottest 100]].\n\nIn addition, the song was featured on the soundtracks to the 2005 films ''[[Just Friends]]'' and ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]'', as well as the soundtracks to the television series, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Hidden Palms]]'' and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. In 2006 it was used in a television commercial for [[Dell]] Computers. On 26 March 2006, Lee performed \"We're All in This Together\" from ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' at the closing ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. The single for \"We're All in This Together\" was released on 8 April 2006. The CD includes cover versions of the song by Pony Up, Holidays on Ice and Gelbison. \"We're All in This Together\" is being used in commercials for Kohl's (2008), Coca-Cola ([[Remix]]ed Australian Summer Series Ads in 2007), the South Australian Government (2006), the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal (2007) and [[Telus]] Mobility's \"My Faves\" (2007).\n\nLee released his sixth album, ''[[Ripe (Ben Lee album)|Ripe]]'', on 18 September 2007 with [[Benji Madden]] and [[Mandy Moore]] making appearances. Mandy Moore sung a light-hearted, '50s style duet with Lee called \"Birds and Bees\". \"Mandy was very sweet and did her best Olivia Newton-John for me. I'm really psyched about this recording,\" Lee says. Madden helped out with some backing vocals, along with US band [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]] and Sara Watkins from the band [[Nickel Creek]]. \"American Television\" from the album was used in a VH1 advertisement for ''[[Flavor of Love 3]]'' and the song \"Ripe\" appeared in an episode of ''One Tree Hill'' (Season 5, episode 2).\n\nIn 2007, Lee performed a cover of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'s \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" for Landmarks on The DL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/29/the-dl-rock-landmarks-featuring-ben-lee|title=AOL Radio Stations &#124; Free Internet Radio|website=Spinner.com|accessdate=5 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212214954/http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/29/the-dl-rock-landmarks-featuring-ben-lee|archivedate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, Lee released his seventh studio album, ''[[The Rebirth of Venus]]'', which received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-rebirth-of-venus|title=Reviews for The Rebirth of Venus by Ben Lee|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> It featured guest performances from the likes of [[Missy Higgins]] and [[Patience Hodgson]], and peaked at No.21 on the [[ARIA Charts]].<ref name=\"AUS\"/>\n\nLee's eighth studio album, ''[[Deeper into Dream]]'', was released on 11 October 2011. It was Lee's first attempt at a concept album, basing the entire 12 tracks around the [[dream]] state. Despite not charting,<ref name=\"AUS\"/> it was received fairly favourably by critics.\n\nIn April 2013, Lee released his ninth and arguably his most experimental studio album entitled ''[[Ayahuasca: Welcome to the Work]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/benlee/updates/20514|title=Ben Lee|website=Pledgemusic.com|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> with collaboration from [[Jessica Chapnik]]. The album is based upon his personal experience with the psychoactive South American drug known as [[Ayahuasca]]. Lee featured as the mentor for [[Joel Madden]]'s team on the 2013 season of ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Annabel Ross|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/the-voice-is-my-rebirth-20130404-2h7qy.html|title=The Voice &#124; Ben Lee|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Lee released his 10th solo album, ''[[Love Is the Great Rebellion]]'', his first on a major label, Warner Bros.

Lee began his career as a musician at the age of 14 with the Sydney band [[Noise Addict]], but focused on his solo career when the band broke up in 1995. He appeared as the protagonist in the Australian film ''[[The Rage in Placid Lake]]'' (2003).<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/australian-singers-turned-actors/|title=Australian Singers Turned Actors|date=July 14, 2019}}</ref>  He has released eleven solo studio albums.\n\n==Career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Noise Addict===\nLee's musical career began in 1993 with the band [[Noise Addict]], who were signed to [[Steve Pavlovic]]'s independent label Fellaheen Records, on the strength of a self-produced and distributed four-track demo recorded in Lee's bedroom. Pavlovic's connections brought the band to the attention of [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Mike D (musician)|Mike D]], both of whom released the band's material in the US. The group put out several releases on the Beasties' [[Grand Royal Records]].\n\nThese including the acoustic ''Young and Jaded'' EP in 1994, which contained Lee's [[Evan Dando]] tribute, \"I Wish I Was Him\". In 1995, Grand Royal released the band's only full-length album, the [[Brad Wood]]-produced ''Meet the Real You''. Noise Addict made a music video for the song \"16\", toured with [[Sebadoh]], but then broke up. Lee was also briefly a member of the alternative act [[Gerling]]. In 2009 Lee recorded a new Noise Addict album, ''It Was Never About the Audience'', with a new lineup; [[Lou Barlow]] and [[Lara Meyerratken]].\n\n===Solo career===\nLee's solo career started at the age of 16, while he was still in Noise Addict. He began recording his first solo album, ''[[Grandpaw Would]]'', in both Sydney and [[Chicago]] with producer [[Brad Wood]]. This was followed by the 1997 album, ''[[Something to Remember Me By]]'', also produced by Wood. An alternate version of his song \"Burn to Shine\", produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]], played over the end credits of the film ''[[Best Men]]''. Lee was then featured on the ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' soundtrack, with the song \"How to Survive a Broken Heart\". 1998's ''[[Breathing Tornados]]'', released on Pavlovic's new label [[Modular Recordings|Modular]], marked a new direction for Lee as he introduced synthesisers and increased instrumentation into his sound.\n\nThe album was a success in Australia, earning Lee [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Award]] nominations for Best Male Artist and Album of the Year. The album's first single, \"[[Cigarettes Will Kill You]]\", was also nominated for Single of the Year and finished second in that year's [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1998|Triple J Hottest 100]]. In 2001, Lee contributed a track (\"Sweet Is the Night\") to a Jeff Lynne tribute album ''[[Lynne Me Your Ears]]''.\n\nLee's fourth album, ''[[Hey You. Yes You.|hey you. yes you.]]'', was released in 2002. The first single from the album, \"Something Borrowed, Something Blue\", reached number 67 on the [[ARIA Charts]] and number 22 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2002|2002's Triple J Hottest 100]]. The second single, \"Running with Scissors\", peaked at number 82 on the ARIA charts. In 2003, he also contributed several songs to the [[Evan Dando]] solo album ''Baby I'm Bored''.\n\nIn late 2004, Lee left Steve Pavlovic's [[Modular Recordings]] and started his own record label, Ten Fingers. The first release on the label was the single, \"[[Gamble Everything for Love]]\", followed by the album, ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' in February 2005, which went double platinum in Australia. A defining release in his career, the album showcased a much brighter, positive side of Lee's personality, in contrast to his previous darker musings. ''Awake Is the New Sleep'' received several nominations for the 2005 [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) awards, and Lee won Best Male Artist, Best Independent Release, and Single of the Year for \"[[Catch My Disease]]\", which Lee wrote with Mcgowan Southworth. \"Catch My Disease\" also went to No. 2 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2005|2005 Triple J Hottest 100]].\n\nIn addition, the song was featured on the soundtracks to the 2005 films ''[[Just Friends]]'' and ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]'', as well as the soundtracks to the television series, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Hidden Palms]]'' and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. In 2006 it was used in a television commercial for [[Dell]] Computers. On 26 March 2006, Lee performed \"We're All in This Together\" from ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' at the closing ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. The single for \"We're All in This Together\" was released on 8 April 2006. The CD includes cover versions of the song by Pony Up, Holidays on Ice and Gelbison. \"We're All in This Together\" is being used in commercials for Kohl's (2008), Coca-Cola ([[Remix]]ed Australian Summer Series Ads in 2007), the South Australian Government (2006), the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal (2007) and [[Telus]] Mobility's \"My Faves\" (2007).\n\nLee released his sixth album, ''[[Ripe (Ben Lee album)|Ripe]]'', on 18 September 2007 with [[Benji Madden]] and [[Mandy Moore]] making appearances. Mandy Moore sung a light-hearted, '50s style duet with Lee called \"Birds and Bees\". \"Mandy was very sweet and did her best Olivia Newton-John for me. I'm really psyched about this recording,\" Lee says. Madden helped out with some backing vocals, along with US band [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]] and Sara Watkins from the band [[Nickel Creek]]. \"American Television\" from the album was used in a VH1 advertisement for ''[[Flavor of Love 3]]'' and the song \"Ripe\" appeared in an episode of ''One Tree Hill'' (Season 5, episode 2).\n\nIn 2007, Lee performed a cover of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'s \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" for Landmarks on The DL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/29/the-dl-rock-landmarks-featuring-ben-lee|title=AOL Radio Stations &#124; Free Internet Radio|website=Spinner.com|accessdate=5 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212214954/http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/29/the-dl-rock-landmarks-featuring-ben-lee|archivedate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, Lee released his seventh studio album, ''[[The Rebirth of Venus]]'', which received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-rebirth-of-venus|title=Reviews for The Rebirth of Venus by Ben Lee|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> It featured guest performances from the likes of [[Missy Higgins]] and [[Patience Hodgson]], and peaked at No.21 on the [[ARIA Charts]].<ref name=\"AUS\"/>\n\nLee's eighth studio album, ''[[Deeper into Dream]]'', was released on 11 October 2011. It was Lee's first attempt at a concept album, basing the entire 12 tracks around the [[dream]] state. Despite not charting,<ref name=\"AUS\"/> it was received fairly favourably by critics.\n\nIn April 2013, Lee released his ninth and arguably his most experimental studio album entitled ''[[Ayahuasca: Welcome to the Work]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/benlee/updates/20514|title=Ben Lee|website=Pledgemusic.com|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> with collaboration from [[Jessica Chapnik]]. The album is based upon his personal experience with the psychoactive South American drug known as [[Ayahuasca]]. Lee featured as the mentor for [[Joel Madden]]'s team on the 2013 season of ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Annabel Ross|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/the-voice-is-my-rebirth-20130404-2h7qy.html|title=The Voice &#124; Ben Lee|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Lee released his 10th solo album, ''[[Love Is the Great Rebellion]]'', his first on a major label, Warner Bros.

Lee has since followed up this release with an acoustically-oriented album, entitled ''Freedom, Love and Recuperation of the Human Mind'', in 2016; as well as a [[children's music|children's album]], called ''Ben Lee Sings Songs About [[Islam]] for the Whole Family'', in 2017.

PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America.{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concerning mounting taxes without colonial representation in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of [[Boston Tea Party|tea in Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] led to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by Washington and [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis's army]], and he surrendered in October 1781.\n\n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America (although Britain continued to war against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean, and India). On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n\n=== Taxation and legislation controversy ===\nThe growing sentiments behind the revolution had its roots in years of taxes and new laws imposed on the colonists who felt they were not represented in a Parliament which existed over seas and whose members they had never seen. Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and to recoup costs of the war itself. The colonists resented being forced to pay for a war in which they had sacrificed many lives. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their own jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the British Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, and paper\u2014items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain\u2014and this established the precedent that Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended\u2014all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance. On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair throw crates of tea overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, stands on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|1846 lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] entitled \"The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor\"; the phrase \"[[Boston Tea Party]]\" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The British seized the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling, and this triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England. Tensions rose after the murder of 11 year-old [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770, and escalated into further outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Many of the colonists suspected that the incident was intentionally provoked and used as a pretext by royal officials to crush the rebellion by force.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p.23</ref> In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but Massachusetts Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor\u2014so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".<ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], p. 155\u2013156</ref>\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.<ref>[[#yale'mga|Avalon Project, 2008, Massachusetts Government Act]]</ref><ref>[[#christie|Christie, 1976]], p. 188</ref> [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Further measures]] allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the British Empire if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity. [[Quartering Act|Further laws]] allowed the governor to billet troops in private homes without the owner's permission.<ref name=ammerman9>[[#ammerman|Ammerman, 1974]], p. 9</ref>{{efn|Ammerman points out that the act only permitted soldiers to be quartered in unoccupied buildings\u2014although they were still private property.

Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies{{efn|Georgia did not attend.}}<ref>[[#ferling2003|Ferling, 2003]], p. 112</ref> convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal by [[Joseph Galloway]] to create an [[Galloway's Plan of Union|American parliament]] to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed [[Continental Association|a compact]] declaring a [[Economic sanctions|trade boycott]] against Britain.<ref name=\"Kramnick21\">[[#kramnick82|Kramnick (Ed.), Paine, 1982]], p. 21</ref><ref name=greene338>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], pp. 338\u2013339</ref>{{efn|\"The plan was considered very attractive to most of the members, as it proposed a popularly elected Grand Council which would represent the interests of the colonies as a whole, and would be a continental equivalent to the English Parliament.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved largely inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had little to no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. They had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. The patriots were on their home ground, had their own newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them. On June 13, 1778, war between France and Britain was declared, with France forming a military alliance with America, a prospect which King George III feared would make the reclamation of the colonies unlikely.<ref>[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 447</ref> During the Revolution, especially during its later years, the British were drawn into numerous other conflicts about the globe.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was somewhat offset by a few senior officers. The Americans solved much of their training dilemma during their stint in winter quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics, and strategy, and he wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref name=\"Ferling pp. 286\">[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref> When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 294\u2013295</ref>\n\n[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]\n\nWhen the war began, the Thirteen Colonies lacked a professional army or navy, and each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]].

In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>[[#harwell2011|Freeman & Harwell (ed.)]], p. 42</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>[[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham, 1971]], Chap.3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to better train them in the ways of troop maneuvers in the field, transforming Washington's army into a more disciplined and effective force overall.<ref name=\"Ferling pp. 286\"/> The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>[[#carp1990|Carp, 1990]], p. 220</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>[[#lengel2007|Lengel, 2007]], pp. 365\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Intelligence and espionage ====\n{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War&nbsp;|&nbsp;Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\nAt the onset of the war, the [[Second Continental Congress]] realized that they would need foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering capability to defeat a world power like Britain. To this end, they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] which operated from 1775\u20131776 for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\". Through secret correspondence, the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France and England and within America. The Committee employed secret agents in Europe to gather foreign intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications, and initiate American propaganda campaigns to gain patriot support.<ref name=cia2011>[[#cia|CIA, 2011, Historical Document]]</ref> Some notable members of the committee included [[Thomas Paine]], the Committee's secretary, and [[Silas Deane]] who was sent undercover to France and was instrumental in securing her aid.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;[2006] ]], p. 43</ref> During this time [[Benjamin Church (physician)|Benjamin Church]], an assumed trusted patriot, was giving the British information on patriot troop strength and positions.<ref>[[#french1932|French, 1932]], p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Culper Ring code.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Page from Culper Ring's code book, with names adjacent to their code numbers]]\n\nThe British were driven out of Boston during the [[Siege of Boston]] and redeployed in Nova Scotia. Washington correctly assumed that an attack on New York City was imminent and departed Boston on April 4, with his army, and headed for Manhattan, where he began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. He realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined British regular troops. Subsequently, he promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel on August 12, 1776, with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers, which came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17 at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref> Among the Rangers was [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City on Manhattan Island.{{efn|The city only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan in 1776.}} Washington knew that a British attack on the city was imminent, and he was desperate to learn when and where it would occur. He asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn, but no one came forward except for the young Nathan Hale, yet ultimately he was only able to provide Washington with nominal intelligence. The British attack occurred on September 15, and Hale was eventually recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper. The British captured him and found sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and Howe ordered that he be summarily hanged without trial the next day (September 22).<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York, he realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British. He enlisted the aid of [[Benjamin Tallmadge]], and together they created the [[Culper Ring|Culper spy ring]] consisting of six men.{{efn|Tallmadge's cover name became John Bolton, and he was the architech of the spy ring.<ref name=baker12/> }} Washington promised members of the ring that their identities and activities would never be revealed.{{efn|Four of their names were revealed in the 1920s through the research of archivist [[Morton Pennypacker]].

The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,<ref>[[#boatner74|Boatner, 1974]], p. 264</ref> and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\">[[#duffy1987|Duffy, 2005 [1987] ]], p. 13</ref> By comparison, Duffy notes that in an era when European rulers were generally revising their forces downward, in favor of a size that could be most effectively controlled (the very different perspective of [[lev\u00e9e en masse|mass conscript]] armies came later, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and then the [[Napoleonic Wars]]), the largest army that [[Frederick the Great]] ever led into battle was 65,000 men (at Prague in 1757), and at other times he commanded between 23,000 and 50,000 men, considering the latter the most effective number.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\"/>\n\n=== African Americans ===\n{{Main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}\n[[File:Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown (1781), by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine DeVerger.png|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]\n\n[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]\u2014slave and free\u2014served on both sides during the war.

Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.<ref>[[#alexander2010|Alexander, 2010]], p. 356</ref>\n\nTens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war. This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.<ref>[[#kolchin1994|Kolchin, 1994]], p. 73</ref> Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war.

After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\">[[#ridpath6|Ridpath, 1915]], vol. 6, p. 2531</ref><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1892 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive maneuvers by the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152\u201353</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005).

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]].

There were other provisions that did not sit well with Washington. Washington resigned as commander-in-chief once the treaty was signed and planned to retire to Mount Vernon.<ref name=ferling378/> Prime Minister, [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|William Petty]], the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace. He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire,  though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778.<ref>[[#reich|1997|Reich, 1997]], p. 121</ref>\n\n[[File:Evacuation Day and Washington's Triumphal Entry.jpg|thumb|left|Washington enters New York in triumph following the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuation of America]].]]\n\nThe Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as [[Prize of war|spoils of war]], a proposal that was dropped when Petty accepted American demands for recognition of independence. On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.<ref>Dwight L.

They negotiated directly with Petty, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.  To this end, Petty offered to cede all the land east of the [[Mississippi River]], north of Florida, and south of Quebec,<ref>William E. Lass (1980).

PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America.{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concerning mounting taxes without colonial representation in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of [[Boston Tea Party|tea in Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] led to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by Washington and [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis's army]], and he surrendered in October 1781.\n\n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America (although Britain continued to war against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean, and India). On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n\n=== Taxation and legislation controversy ===\nThe growing sentiments behind the revolution had its roots in years of taxes and new laws imposed on the colonists who felt they were not represented in a Parliament which existed over seas and whose members they had never seen. Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and to recoup costs of the war itself. The colonists resented being forced to pay for a war in which they had sacrificed many lives. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their own jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the British Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, and paper\u2014items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain\u2014and this established the precedent that Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended\u2014all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance. On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair throw crates of tea overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, stands on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|1846 lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] entitled \"The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor\"; the phrase \"[[Boston Tea Party]]\" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The British seized the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling, and this triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England.

Cornwallis claimed that he 'had been compelled' to take his position at Yorktown, contrary to his advice to Clinton, that Yorktown had been occupied as a result of Clinton's orders, and because of repeated promises of reinforcements. Clinton took exception to all such claims and subsequently wrote his own account of the matter, again placing much of the blame on the naval support that never arrived, which was promised by Germain. Clinton, however, asked Germain to publish his account of the defeat upon his return to London, but Germain declined.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved largely inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had little to no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. They had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. The patriots were on their home ground, had their own newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them. On June 13, 1778, war between France and Britain was declared, with France forming a military alliance with America, a prospect which King George III feared would make the reclamation of the colonies unlikely.<ref>[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 447</ref> During the Revolution, especially during its later years, the British were drawn into numerous other conflicts about the globe.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was somewhat offset by a few senior officers. The Americans solved much of their training dilemma during their stint in winter quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics, and strategy, and he wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref name=\"Ferling pp. 286\">[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref> When the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 294\u2013295</ref>\n\n[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]\n\nWhen the war began, the Thirteen Colonies lacked a professional army or navy, and each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare, but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war. Three branches of the United States Military forces trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the Army comes from the [[Continental Army]]; the Navy recognizes October 13, 1775, as the date of its official establishment when the Continental Congress created the [[Continental Navy]], appointing [[Esek Hopkins]] as the Navy's first commander.<ref>[[#miller1997|Miller, 1997&nbsp;&nbsp;[1977] ]], pp. 11-12, 16</ref> The Marine Corps links to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed by a resolution of Congress on November 10, 1775.<ref>[[#smith2014|Smith, 2014]], pp. iv, 459</ref>\n\n==== George Washington's roles ====\n{{Main|George Washington in the American Revolution }}\n\n[[File:George Washington, 1776.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|<center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Washington<br />Commander of the [[Continental Army]]<br>by [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1776)</center>|alt=Formal painting of General George Washington, standing in uniform, as commander of the Continental Army]]\n\nRecognizing George Washington's skill and experience as an officer, and his ability to unite the colonies \"... better than any other person in the Union\", [[John Adams]] nominated Washington on June 14, 1775, to be the commander of the Continental Army. Washington was unanimously confirmed by the Continental Congress on June 16,<ref>[[#taylor2016|Taylor, 2016]], pp. 141\u2013142</ref><ref>[[#burke75|Davis, 1975]], pp. 11\u201313</ref> and he officially assumed command in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 3.<ref name=gardner3>[[#bell2005|Bell, 2005]], pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nWashington assumed five main roles during the war.<ref>[[#higginbotham|Higginbotham, 1987]], pp. 69, 99, Chap, et al</ref> First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence. When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers and navy it had sent, which assisted him greatly in defeating Cornwallis during the surrender of Yorktown in 1781.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost more battles than he won, but never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2007]], pp. 258-261</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged with selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>[[#harwell2011|Freeman & Harwell (ed.)]], p. 42</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>[[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham, 1971]], Chap.3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to better train them in the ways of troop maneuvers in the field, transforming Washington's army into a more disciplined and effective force overall.<ref name=\"Ferling pp. 286\"/> The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>[[#carp1990|Carp, 1990]], p. 220</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>[[#lengel2007|Lengel, 2007]], pp. 365\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Intelligence and espionage ====\n{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War&nbsp;|&nbsp;Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\nAt the onset of the war, the [[Second Continental Congress]] realized that they would need foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering capability to defeat a world power like Britain. To this end, they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] which operated from 1775\u20131776 for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\". Through secret correspondence, the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France and England and within America. The Committee employed secret agents in Europe to gather foreign intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications, and initiate American propaganda campaigns to gain patriot support.<ref name=cia2011>[[#cia|CIA, 2011, Historical Document]]</ref> Some notable members of the committee included [[Thomas Paine]], the Committee's secretary, and [[Silas Deane]] who was sent undercover to France and was instrumental in securing her aid.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;[2006] ]], p. 43</ref> During this time [[Benjamin Church (physician)|Benjamin Church]], an assumed trusted patriot, was giving the British information on patriot troop strength and positions.<ref>[[#french1932|French, 1932]], p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:Culper Ring code.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Page from Culper Ring's code book, with names adjacent to their code numbers]]\n\nThe British were driven out of Boston during the [[Siege of Boston]] and redeployed in Nova Scotia. Washington correctly assumed that an attack on New York City was imminent and departed Boston on April 4, with his army, and headed for Manhattan, where he began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. He realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined British regular troops. Subsequently, he promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel on August 12, 1776, with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers, which came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17 at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref> Among the Rangers was [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City on Manhattan Island.{{efn|The city only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan in 1776.}} Washington knew that a British attack on the city was imminent, and he was desperate to learn when and where it would occur. He asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn, but no one came forward except for the young Nathan Hale, yet ultimately he was only able to provide Washington with nominal intelligence. The British attack occurred on September 15, and Hale was eventually recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper. The British captured him and found sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and Howe ordered that he be summarily hanged without trial the next day (September 22).<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York, he realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British.

The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,<ref>[[#boatner74|Boatner, 1974]], p. 264</ref> and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\">[[#duffy1987|Duffy, 2005 [1987] ]], p. 13</ref> By comparison, Duffy notes that in an era when European rulers were generally revising their forces downward, in favor of a size that could be most effectively controlled (the very different perspective of [[lev\u00e9e en masse|mass conscript]] armies came later, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and then the [[Napoleonic Wars]]), the largest army that [[Frederick the Great]] ever led into battle was 65,000 men (at Prague in 1757), and at other times he commanded between 23,000 and 50,000 men, considering the latter the most effective number.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\"/>\n\n=== African Americans ===\n{{Main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}\n[[File:Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown (1781), by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine DeVerger.png|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]\n\n[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]\u2014slave and free\u2014served on both sides during the war.

Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.<ref>[[#alexander2010|Alexander, 2010]], p. 356</ref>\n\nTens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war. This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war.

After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\">[[#ridpath6|Ridpath, 1915]], vol. 6, p. 2531</ref><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1892 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163\" />\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive maneuvers by the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152\u201353</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005).

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, December 15, 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, July 19 and August 29, 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, October 31, 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39</ref><ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.

Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved June 10, 2017</ref> Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and to enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was agrarian, not urban, and the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.<ref name=\"Pole 2004\"/>\n\n[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black Loyalist]] soldiers fighting alongside British regulars in the 1781 [[Battle of Jersey]], from ''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'']]\n\nThe need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in [[Jacobite rising of 1745#Legacy|Scotland]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Ireland]].<ref>Black (2001), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.<ref name=\"Wilson p. 112\"/> Neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Patriots when brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs in the Carolinas in the later stages of the war.<ref>Black (2001), pp. 14\u201316 (Harsh methods), pp. 35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p. 16 (neutrals into revolutionaries).</ref> Conversely, Loyalists were often emboldened when Patriots resorted to intimidating suspected Tories, such as destroying property or [[tarring and feathering]].<ref>Leonard Woods Larabee, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) pp 164\u201365</ref><ref>Calhoon, Robert M.

That same day, by arrangement with Washington, [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|General Carleton]] issued a similar order to British troops. British troops, however, were not to disband until a prisoner of war exchange occurred, an effort that involved much negotiation and would take some seven months to effect.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p. 553</ref>\n\n=== Treaty of Paris ===\n{{Main|Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}\n[[File:Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West 1783.jpg|thumb|''[[Treaty of Paris (painting)|Treaty of Paris]]'', by [[Benjamin West]] (1783), depicts the American delegation to the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

He preferred that the colonies accept Dominion status within the Empire,  though a similar offer had been rejected by the Americans in 1778.<ref>[[#reich|1997|Reich, 1997]], p. 121</ref>\n\n[[File:Evacuation Day and Washington's Triumphal Entry.jpg|thumb|left|Washington enters New York in triumph following the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuation of America]].]]\n\nThe Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as [[Prize of war|spoils of war]], a proposal that was dropped when Petty accepted American demands for recognition of independence. On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control. The United States fiercely opposed the proposal.<ref>Dwight L.

They negotiated directly with Petty, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.  To this end, Petty offered to cede all the land east of the [[Mississippi River]], north of Florida, and south of Quebec,<ref>William E. Lass (1980).

As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as [[smallpox]] claimed more lives than battle.
