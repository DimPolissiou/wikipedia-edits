Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as \"Coquerel's mouse lemur\".{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|p=67}}\n\nIn 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} with fork-marked lemurs being either a [[sister group]] of all cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} or more closely related to [[sportive lemur]]s (''Lepilemur'').{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}\n\nAlthough ''Mirza'', ''Microcebus'', and ''Allocebus'' form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|pp=1627\u20131628}} All three are thought to have diverged at least 20&nbsp;[[myr|mya]] (million years ago),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}} although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between ''Mirza'' and ''Microcebus'' at 24.2&nbsp;mya.

Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M<sup>1\u20132</sup>) have a more anterior [[Molar (tooth)|hypocone]] that sits opposite the [[Molar (tooth)|metacone]], compared to the mouse lemurs' more [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|posterior]] hypocone, which is presumably a [[Symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait]].{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Also on M<sup>1</sup> and M<sup>2</sup>, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small [[Cusp (anatomy)|cuspules]].{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs have two pairs of [[Mammary gland|mammae]], one on the chest (pectoral) and one on the [[abdomen]] (abdominal).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=128}} Their fur is typically grayish-brown on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] (back) side and more gray in color on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] (front) side.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=18}} The tail is typically black-tipped.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs.

Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}} and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal [[torpor]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}\n\n===Nesting===\nBoth species sleep in round nests up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across made of interlaced [[liana]]s, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands. Nests are typically between {{convert|2|and|10|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. [[Euphorbiaceae]]) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12&nbsp;nests every few days to avoid predators.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Only females have been observed building nests in the wild,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Because they are poorly developed, they initially remain in their mother's nest for up to three weeks, being transported by mouth between nests.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} Once they have grown sufficiently, typically after three weeks, the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} After a month, the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother, and between the first and second month, young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors (including mounting, neck biting, and pelvic thrusting).{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} By the third month, the young forage independently, though they maintain vocal contact with their mother{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} and use a small part of her range.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}}\n\nFemales start reproducing after ten months, while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season,{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} and is so large relative to the animal's body mass that it is the highest among all [[primate]]s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} This emphasis on sperm production in males, as well as the use of [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], suggests a mating system best described as [[Polygynandry|polygynandrous]]{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} where males use [[scramble competition]] (roaming widely to find many females).{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} In contrast, male Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females (contest competition) during their breeding season.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} Males disperse from their natal range, and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several. Females reproduce every year, although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity. In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} though in captivity they can live up to 15&nbsp;years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Madagascar buzzard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Madagascar buzzard sitting on a branch|The [[Madagascar buzzard]] preys on giant mouse lemurs.]]\nBoth species are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, [[Natural gum|tree gums]], large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} and eggs.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} after an individual was found with a half-eaten [[gray mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;murinus'') in a trap.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|p=1222}} During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the [[larva]]e of [[hemiptera]]n and [[cochineal]] insects as well as tree gums.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on [[cashew]] fruits during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are often [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with mouse lemurs, such as ''M.&nbsp;murinus'', though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} At the [[Marosalaza]] forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages [[niche differentiation]] by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=115}}\n\n[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as the [[Madagascar buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') are their most significant predators.

Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as \"Coquerel's mouse lemur\".{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|p=67}}\n\nIn 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} with fork-marked lemurs being either a [[sister group]] of all cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} or more closely related to [[sportive lemur]]s (''Lepilemur'').{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}\n\nAlthough ''Mirza'', ''Microcebus'', and ''Allocebus'' form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|pp=1627\u20131628}} All three are thought to have diverged at least 20&nbsp;[[myr|mya]] (million years ago),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}} although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between ''Mirza'' and ''Microcebus'' at 24.2&nbsp;mya.

Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]] during the 1990s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}\n\n===Population density and territory===\nBefore the recognition of more than one species, differences in [[population density]] were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near [[Ambanja]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}} The former range between 30 and 210&nbsp;individuals per square kilometer (250&nbsp;acres),{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} with lower densities in open areas of the forest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086&nbsp;individuals per km<sup>2</sup>. However, in the case of the northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of [[Introduced species|introduced]] cashew and [[mango]] help sustain these higher populations.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}}\n\nAccording to studies of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, [[home range]]s of both sexes vary from {{convert|1|to|4|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} with frequent overlap,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} particularly on the periphery of their range.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals can have up to eight neighbors.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Home ranges of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Female home ranges show no variability in size, and can remain stable for years. At Kirindy Forest, genetic studies showed that the home ranges of related females tend to clump closely together, while unrelated males may overlap their range, suggesting male [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and migration is responsible for [[gene flow]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nBoth species are strictly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and [[Personal grooming|self-groom]] for a few minutes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Both species typically forage between {{convert|5|and|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the forest floor, though Coquerel's giant mouse lemur has been observed on the ground.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} They primarily move by [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] running and occasionally leaping between branches, and use the same feeding postures as mouse lemurs, such as clinging to tree trunks.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} When moving through the trees, giant mouse lemurs scurry rapidly like mouse lemurs, unlike dwarf lemurs, which use more deliberate movement.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Slow movements are usually seen in lower, denser foliage when hunting for insects, while more rapid motion and leaping is typically seen at moderate heights of {{convert|2|\u2013|5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}} and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time.

Nests are typically between {{convert|2|and|10|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. [[Euphorbiaceae]]) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12&nbsp;nests every few days to avoid predators.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Only females have been observed building nests in the wild,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}.

Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily.

It consists of 124 Representatives elected to two year terms at the same time as US Congressional elections.\n\nUnlike many legislatures, seating on the floor is not divided by party, but is arranged by county delegation.  This is a legacy of the original apportionment of the chamber.  Until 1964, each of [[South Carolina]]'s counties was a legislative district, with the number of representatives determined by the county's population.\n\n==Qualifications and terms==\n\nRepresentatives are considered part-time citizen legislators who serve two-year terms. Representatives are elected at-large by their district, and there are no term limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scstatehouse.gov/house.php|title=South Carolina Legislature Online - House of Representatives|website=www.scstatehouse.gov|accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref> Representatives must be 21 years of age before they are eligible to become a representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scvotes.org/candidate-qualifications|title=Candidate Qualifications - SCVotes|website=www.scvotes.org|accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!rowspan=3|Affiliation\n!colspan=2|Party <div style=\"font-size:80%\">(Shading indicates majority caucus)</div>\n!rowspan=3|Total\n!\n|-style=\"height:5px\"\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n|style=\"background: black\"|\n|-\n![[South Carolina Republican Party|Republican]]\n![[South Carolina Democratic Party|Democratic]]\n!Vacant\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|Beginning of 2019-20 Session\n| {{party shading/Republican}}| 79\n|44\n!123\n|1\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%:|Latest voting share\n!{{party shading/Republican}}|{{percentage|80|124|2}}\n!{{percentage|44|124|2}}\n!colspan=2|\n|}\n\n==Leadership==\n{{Chamber officers box begin\n |chamber=South Carolina House of Representatives\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position no party link\n |position=Speaker\n |name=[[Jay Lucas]]\n |party=Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position no party link\n |position=Majority Leader\n |name=[[Gary Simrill]]\n |party=Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position\n |position=Minority Leader\n |name=[[Todd Rutherford]]\n |party=Democratic Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box end}}\n\n==Current members==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It consists of 124 Representatives elected to two year terms at the same time as US Congressional elections.\n\nUnlike many legislatures, seating on the floor is not divided by party, but is arranged by county delegation.  This is a legacy of the original apportionment of the chamber.  Until 1964, each of [[South Carolina]]'s counties was a legislative district, with the number of representatives determined by the county's population.\n\n==Qualifications and terms==\n\nRepresentatives are considered part-time citizen legislators who serve two-year terms. Representatives are elected at-large by their district, and there are no term limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scstatehouse.gov/house.php|title=South Carolina Legislature Online - House of Representatives|website=www.scstatehouse.gov|accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref> Representatives must be 21 years of age before they are eligible to become a representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scvotes.org/candidate-qualifications|title=Candidate Qualifications - SCVotes|website=www.scvotes.org|accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!rowspan=3|Affiliation\n!colspan=2|Party <div style=\"font-size:80%\">(Shading indicates majority caucus)</div>\n!rowspan=3|Total\n!\n|-style=\"height:5px\"\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n|style=\"background: black\"|\n|-\n![[South Carolina Republican Party|Republican]]\n![[South Carolina Democratic Party|Democratic]]\n!Vacant\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|Beginning of 2019-20 Session\n| {{party shading/Republican}}| 79\n|44\n!123\n|1\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%:|Latest voting share\n!{{party shading/Republican}}|{{percentage|80|124|2}}\n!{{percentage|44|124|2}}\n!colspan=2|\n|}\n\n==Leadership==\n{{Chamber officers box begin\n |chamber=South Carolina House of Representatives\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position no party link\n |position=Speaker\n |name=[[Jay Lucas]]\n |party=Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position no party link\n |position=Majority Leader\n |name=[[Gary Simrill]]\n |party=Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box position\n |position=Minority Leader\n |name=[[Todd Rutherford]]\n |party=Democratic Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Chamber officers box end}}\n\n==Current members==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Beginning in September 1899 several employees of the DCS&I, which had a policy of not employing unionized members, [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union, and were subsequently terminated. After the intervention of law enforcement, the strike was settled three months later when the DCS&I reaffirmed their policy of not hiring union members.<ref>Dub\u00e9 2008, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a [[froth flotation|flotation plant]] to produce [[copper sulfate]] in the 1920s. [[iron ore|Iron]] and [[zinc#production|zinc concentrate]]s were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s.

The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Approximately five miles from the entrance to [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], the Stanley offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and especially [[Long's Peak]]. It was built by [[Freelan Oscar Stanley]] of [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Steamer]] fame and opened on July 4, 1909, as a resort for upper class easterners and a health retreat for sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis.<ref name=legends>{{cite web|title=The Haunted Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/stanley-hotel-colorado/|author= Kathy Weiser|work=LegendsOfAmerica.com|accessdate=Dec 24, 2018}}</ref> The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=nris />\n\nThe Stanley Hotel served as the inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] 1977 bestselling novel [[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] and as the filming location for the 1997 [[The Shining (miniseries)|TV miniseries]], also written by King. Today, the hotel features a restaurant, spa and bed-and-breakfast, and provides guided tours.\n\n==History==\nIn 1903, the Yankee [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|steam-powered car]] inventor  [[Freelan Oscar Stanley]] (1849\u20131940) was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=usparks>{{cite web|title=Rocky Mountain National Park - Culture|work=US-Parks.com|url=http://www.us-parks.com/rocky/culture.html|accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with lots of sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many \"[[Tuberculosis|lungers]]\" of his day, Stanley resolved to take the curative air of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He and his wife Flora arrived in [[Denver, Colorado]] in March and, in June, on the recommendation of Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney, relocated to [[Estes Park, Colorado]] for the rest of the summer. Over the course of the season, Stanley's health improved dramatically.<ref name=legends/> Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year. He lived to the ripe age of 91, dying of a heart attack in Newton, Massachusetts, one year after his wife, in 1940.\n\n[[File:4thEarlOfDunraven.jpg|thumb|left|The 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl]]\nBy 1907, Stanley had recovered completely. However, not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new summer home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the Hotel Stanley, a 48-room grand hotel that catered to the class of moderately wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys' social circle back east as well as to consumptives seeking the healthful climate.<ref name=usparks/>\n\nThe land was officially purchased in 1908 through the representatives of [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]], the [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer who had originally acquired it by stretching the provisions of the [[Homestead Act of 1862]] and [[Preemption Act of 1841|pre-emption rights]]. Between 1872 and 1884, Dunraven claimed {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} of the Estes Valley in an unsuccessful attempt to create a private hunting preserve, making him one of the largest foreign holders of American lands. Unpopular with the local ranchers and farmers, Dunraven left the area for the last time in 1884, relegating the ranch to the management of an overseer.<ref name=legends/><ref name=usparks/> Dunraven's presence in Colorado had become so well known in the United States that his situation was parodied in [[Charles King (general)|Charles King]]'s novel ''Dunraven Ranch'' (1892) as well as [[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'' (1974). His reputation was such that, when Stanley suggested \"The Dunraven\" as a name for his new hotel, 180 people signed a buckskin petition requesting that he name it for himself instead.\n\nThe main hotel and concert hall were completed in 1909 and the Manor in 1910. To bring guests from the nearest train depot in the foothills town of [[Lyons, Colorado]], Stanley's car company produced a fleet of specially-designed steam-powered vehicles called Mountain Wagons which seated 9 to 12 passengers.  Stanley operated the hotel almost as a pastime remarking once that he spent more money than he made each summer.\n\nIn 1926, Stanley sold his hotel to a private company incorporated for the sole purpose of running it. The venture failed and, in 1929, Stanley purchased his property out of foreclosure selling it again, in 1930, to fellow automobile and hotel magnate, Roe Emery of Denver. Until 1983, the resort was only open during the summer, shutting down for the winter every year. The presence of the hotel and Stanley's own involvement greatly contributed to the growth of Estes Park (incorporated in 1917) and the creation of the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] (established in 1915).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:The Stanley Hotel.JPG|June 2008\nFile:Stanley in Snow.JPG|February 2011\nFile:Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado.jpg|South elevation\nFile:StanleyHotelLobby.jpg|Lobby looking east\nFile:Music Room Stanley Hotel.JPG|Music room looking south\n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Stanley Hotel National Register Historic District]] contains eleven contributing structures including the main hotel, the concert hall, a carriage house, manager's cottage, gate house and The Lodge\u2014a smaller bed-and-breakfast originally called Stanley Manor. The buildings were designed by F.O. Stanley with the professional assistance of Denver architect T. Robert Wieger, Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers, and contractor Frank Kirchoff. The site was chosen for its vantage overlooking the Estes valley and Long's Peak within the National Park. The main building, concert hall and Manor House are steel-frame structures on foundations of random rubble granite with clapboard siding and asphalt shingle roof. Originally, Stanley chose a yellow [[ocher]] color for the buildings' exteriors with white accents and trim. Lumber used in the structures was harvested from the areas of [[Bierstadt Lake]] and Hidden Valley in the future national park, and purchased from Kirchoff's Lumberyard in Denver and Bluff City Lumber Company of [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. The granite was quarried from the Baldwin property near the confluence of Beaver Brook and the Big Thompson River. Non-local materials were brought to Lyons, Colorado by rail and thence to Estes Park by mule-drawn wagon.\n\nUpon opening in 1909, the hotel was one of first in the country to be fully electrified from the lighting to the kitchens (although the light fixtures could be operated with either electricity or gas). To supply his hotel with power, Stanley led the construction of the Fall River Hydroplant which also brought electricity to the town of Estes Park for the first time. Every guest room had a telephone and each pair of rooms shared an ''en suite'' bathroom with running water supplied by Black Canyon Creek, which had been dammed in 1906. Circa 1935, during Roe Emery's tenure as owner the [[ochre]]-colored siding was painted white and most of the original electro-gas fixtures were replaced.\n\nAlthough the style of the hotel evokes the [[federal style]] architecture of New England, the general form and layout are designed to accommodate very high contemporary standards of hygiene and comfort. Given Stanley's interest in healthful living and his rational approach to architectural planning, he may have been inspired by the Carolina Hotel (built 1899\u20131900) in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]], designed by [[Bertrand E. Taylor]] (1856\u20131909)\u2014a national leader in hospital design and, like Stanley, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts. The parallels between the Carolina and the Stanley extend beyond architecture; the builder of the Carolina, [[James Walker Tufts]], was a Boston soda magnate who initially developed Pinehurst as a health resort for people with pulmonary diseases. Whether or not Stanley had exposure to Taylor's work and ideas, it is certain that he was influenced by Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney of the University of Denver, a contemporary expert in the treatment of tuberculosis; Stanley's Estes Park summer house is illustrated in Bonney's book, ''Pulmonary Tuberculosis'' (published while the hotel was under construction), and Stanley himself is acknowledged in the preface for his \"interest and efficiency in connection with the photographic illustrations.\" Although the hotel never operated as a sanitarium ''per se'', it was designed to be an optimal environment for pulmonary health. When the construction plans were announced, the ''Fort Collins Weekly Courier'' reported, \"[Estes Park] has been a favorite place for doctors to send the more robust of their patients, who were in shape to be braced up by the keen air and the considerable altitude, but it has not always been possible to get suitable accommodations and surroundings for them. With the park turned into a vast pleasure ground, and ample provisions for the best food products, all precious objections will be dissipated.\" Accordingly, the facilities were sited and designed to meet the requirements expounded in Bonney's book. For instance, according to Bonney,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"An ideal site for a sanitarium, or, in fact, for all buildings designed especially for pulmonary invalids, should be upon the southern slope of a hill or near the base of a moderately high mountain. In order to afford shelter from the prevailing winds, the building should be located according to regional weather conditions either to the east or the west of a spur extending southward. It is still more advantageous if the mountain rises to a considerable distance in the far background, even to a height of several hundred feet&nbsp;... The soil should be dry, porous and sandy although a rocky formation is not undesirable. On account of the necessity of irrigation in dry climates, no elaborate attempt should be made to beautify the grounds by laying out expansive lawns or by disposing flower-gardens in the immediate vicinity of the sanitarium, although such ornamentation adds greatly to the attractiveness of the institution. Undoubted benefit accrues to the invalid from a pleasing landscape. Attractive views, combining land and sky effect, contribute to a remarkable degree in breaking an unceasing monotony. Definite inspiration and elevation of spirits are not infrequently afforded by the sublimity of scenic grandeur witnessed in mountain resorts.\"<ref name=\"Bonney1908\">{{cite book|author=Sherman Grant Bonney|title=Pulmonary tuberculosis and its complications, with special reference to diagnosis and treatment|url=https://archive.org/details/pulmonarytuberc00bonngoog|quote=Bonney, Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Its Complications.|year=1908|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/pulmonarytuberc00bonngoog/page/n794 782]}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis text is accompanied by a photograph of \"the delightful view afforded from the porches of cottages for consumptives in Estes Park, Colorado.\" The hotel also provided the ample porches, ventilation, southern exposure, and appetizing food recommended in Bonney's book.\n\nThe style of the Stanley Hotel campus is [[colonial revival]]. The strong symmetrical arrangement of the primary facade, and the classically derived ornamental articulations such as the two-stage octagonal [[cupola]], [[Venetian Window|Palladian window]], [[fanlight]]s, [[dormer]]s, swan's neck [[pediment]]s, scroll [[bracket (architecture)|brackets]], paired [[Tuscan Order|Tuscan columns]], oval [[ox-eye window]]s, and elaborately turned [[baluster]]s are all stylistic hallmarks of [[Georgian architecture|American Georgian]] or [[Federal Style|Federal]] design. The clapboard siding and carved wood elements are characteristic of New England's regional building practices. And yet, these features are modified and arranged in ways that cannot be found in any historic example. These inaccuracies are due less to ignorance of historic design principles than a desire to utilize historical elements in light of modern design principles. By the 1920s, this approach to colonial revival design was supplanted by a more accurate use of historical details.\n\nThe style of the hotel contrasts sharply with the [[Rustic architecture|rustic style]] used for the other hotels in Estes Park, before and after the Stanley's construction. However, it was not an uncommon choice for a hotel of the Stanley's size and quality in the time period (e.g. [[Royal Poinciana Hotel]], [[Lake Yellowstone Hotel]], [[Mount Washington Hotel]]). In general, the colonial revival symbolized the unique historical development of the United States and its role in forming a unique American identity, characterized by the New England ethos and the political ideals of the founding fathers. These characteristics were supposed to be especially embodied by the traditional architecture of New England which was admired for its elegance and functionalism. Thus, everywhere the Colonial Revival was seen, it symbolized the progress of American Civilization based upon enduring traditional values. By the same token, the style of the Stanley was a reflection of the clientele's back-east gentility as well as an advertisement for the hotel's modern comforts and the future potential of Estes Park as a posh resort town. All of these connotations were heightened in contrast with the ruggedness of the Rocky Mountains and the rusticity of the other hotels in the area.   \n \n===Main building===\nThe floor plan of the main hotel (completed 1909) was laid out to accommodate the various activities popular with the American upper class at the turn of the twentieth century and the spaces are decorated accordingly. The music room, for instance, with its cream-colored walls (originally green and white), picture windows and fine, classical plaster-work was designed for letter-writing during the day and chamber music at night - cultured pursuits perceived as feminine. On the other hand, the smoking lounge (today the Pi\u00f1on Room) and adjoining billiard room, with their dark stained-wood elements and granite arch fireplace were designated for enjoyment by male guests. Stanley himself, having been raised in a calvinist household in the [[Maine Law|tee-totaling State of Maine]] and having recovered from a serious lung disease, did not smoke cigars or drink alcohol, but these were essential after-dinner activities for most men at the time. Billiards, however, was among Stanley's most cherished pastimes.\n\nWhen the hotel opened, it had 48 guest rooms, each with a telephone and each pair sharing a bathroom. With no central heating or ventilation system, the structure was designed to facilitate natural airflow; the Palladian window at the top of the grand stair could be opened to induce a cross-breeze through the lobby, French doors in all the public spaces open onto verandas, and two curving staircases connecting the guest corridors prevent stagnant air in the upper floors. Although the main hotel is now heated in the winter, guests still depend on natural ventilation for cooling in the summer. Within a few years of opening, a hydraulic elevator was put in operation. In 1916, the east wing of the main building was extended in the rear adding several guest rooms. Around this time, the alcove of the music room was added. In 1921, a rear veranda was enclosed forming a room that currently serves as a gift shop. Around 1935, the hydraulic elevator system was replaced with a cable-operated system and extended to the fourth floor necessitating the addition of a secondary cupola to house the mechanical apparatus. Originally, a porte-cochere extended from the central bay of the front porch, but this was removed when the south terrace was converted into a parking lot. In 1983, a service tunnel was excavated, connecting the basement-level corridor to the staff entrance. It is cut directly through the living granite on which the hotel rests.\n\n===Concert hall===\nThe concert hall, east of the hotel, was built by Stanley in 1909 with the assistance of Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers, the same architect who designed his summer cottage. According to popular legend, it was built by F.O. Stanley as a gift for his wife, Flora. The interior is decorated in the same manner as the music room in the main hotel and vaguely resembles that of the [[Boston Symphony Hall]] ([[McKim, Mead & White]], 1900) with which the Stanleys would have been familiar. The stage features a trap door, used for theatrical entrances and exits. The lower level once housed a two-lane bowling alley which was removed during the ownership of Maxwell Abbell. It possibly resembled the bowling alley at the Stanley's Hunnewell Club in Newton, pictures of which are archived in the [[Newton Free Library]]. The hall underwent extensive repair and renovation in the 2000s.\n\n===The Lodge===\n[[File:Lodge at the Stanley Hotel Estes Park Colorado 2018.jpg|thumb|300px|The Lodge at the Stanley Hotel]]\nOnce called Stanley Manor, this smaller hotel between the main structure and the concert hall is a 2:3 scaled-down version of the main hotel. Unlike its model, the manor was fully heated from completion in 1910 which may indicate that Stanley planned to use it as a winter resort when the main building was closed for the season. However, unlike many other Colorado mountain towns now famous for their winter sports, Estes Park never attracted off-season visitors in Stanley's day and the manor remained empty for much of the year. Today it is called The Lodge and serves as a bed-and-breakfast that is off-limits to the public.\n\n==''The Shining''==\n{{Quote\n|text=Any big hotels have got scandals [sic]&nbsp;...

King had set the events of the book in an amusement park but he felt a more isolated setting was necessary. According to George Beahm's ''Stephen King Companion'', \"on the advisement of locals who suggested a resort hotel located in Estes Park, an hour's drive away to the north, Stephen and Tabitha King found themselves checking in at the Stanley Hotel just as its other guests were checking out, because the hotel was shutting down for the winter season. After checking in and after Tabitha went to bed, King roamed the halls and went down to the hotel bar, where drinks were served by a bartender named Grady. As he returned to his room, numbered 217, his imagination was fired up by the hotel's remote location, its grand size, and its eerie desolation. And when King went into the bathroom and pulled back the pink curtain for the tub, which had claw feet, he thought, 'What if somebody died here? At that moment, I knew I had a book.'\"<ref>{{cite book|author=George Beahm|title=''The Stephen King Companion: Four Decades of Fear from the Master of Horror.'' |location=New York|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|date= 2015 |pages=126\u201327}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1977 interview by the Literary Guild, King recounts, \"While we were living [in Boulder] we heard about this terrific old mountain resort hotel and decided to give it a try. But when we arrived, they were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the place\u2014with all those long, empty corridors.\" King and his wife were served dinner in an empty dining room accompanied by canned orchestral music: \"Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things. And by the time I went to bed that night, I had the whole book [''The Shining''] in my mind.\"<ref>Quoted in George Beahm, ''The Stephen King Companion''. (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 1989), 128.</ref> In another retelling, King says, \"I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of [[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] firmly set in my mind.\"<ref name=\"boogeyman\">George Beahm,''Stephen King: America's Best Loved Boogeyman'' (Andrews McMeel Press, 1998).</ref>\n\n[[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] was published in 1977 and became the third great success of King's career after [[Carrie (novel)|''Carrie'']] and ''[['Salem's Lot]]''. The primary setting is an isolated Colorado resort called the Overlook Hotel which closes for the winter. In the front matter of the book, King tactfully states, \"Some of the most beautiful resort hotels in the world are located in Colorado, but the hotel in these pages is based on none of them. The Overlook and the people associated with it exist wholly in the author's imagination.\"<ref>Stephen King, ''The Shining'' (Doubleday, 1977)</ref> King locates the Overlook Hotel near the fictional town of Sidewinder which is supposed to be near Estes Park. The Stanley Hotel is never mentioned. Notwithstanding King's efforts to explicitly differentiate the Overlook Hotel from the Stanley, it seems that King imagined the Stanley Hotel as the setting of ''The Shining''. Room 217 of the Overlook features prominently in the novel, having been the room where King spent the night at the Stanley. This is the room on the second floor in the center of the west wing with a balcony overlooking the south terrace. Room 217 remains the Stanley's most requested accommodation.\n\nDespite its connection with Stephen King's novel, the Stanley Hotel has little to do with [[Stanley Kubrick's]] iconic 1980 [[The Shining (film)|film adaptation]]. Kubrick's vision for the movie differed significantly from King's in many ways, including the portrayal of the Overlook Hotel. The exteriors of Kubrick's Overlook were supplied by the [[Timberline Lodge]] (built 1936\u201338) near Mt. Hood in Oregon and inspiration for the interior sets (erected at [[Elstree Studios]] in the UK) came primarily from the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] (built 1927) in [[Yosemite National Park]]. The management of the Timberline Lodge, fearful that guests would refuse to stay in their Room 217 if it were featured in a horror movie, insisted that Kubrick change the haunted room in the film to the fictional Room 237.\n\nKing was apparently displeased with Kubrick's film, based mainly on [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of Jack Torrance. In 1996, Warner Brothers secured the television rights to ''The Shining'' and produced a miniseries (stylized as \"[[The Shining (TV miniseries)|Stephen King's The Shining]]\") with a script by Stephen King. Thanks to King, the Stanley Hotel was chosen as the primary shooting location. A playhouse version of the main building which adorned the lawn of the Overlook Hotel in the series can be viewed in the basement of the Stanley.\n\n===The hedge maze===\n\nIn 2015, the open area in front of the hotel, originally a driveway for Stanley Steamers and a promenade for guests to enjoy mountain views, was replaced with a hedge maze. This non-historic feature was added to evoke the hotel's connection to ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. Although a hedge maze features prominently in Stanley Kubrick's film, no such feature appears in King's novel. The lawn of the Overlook Hotel, as King imagined it, was adorned with [[topiary]] animals and it was set that way for the shooting of [[The Shining (miniseries)|''Stephen King's The Shining'']]. Historically, neither existed at the Stanley. The design was the result of a competition, chosen from amongst 300 entrants from across the globe. The following year, another competition was held to design a focal point for the hedge maze. Sculptors Sutton Betti and Daniel Glanz won the competition with a sculpture of F.O. Stanley holding one of his violins. The sculpture was installed and dedicated on September 29, 2016.\n\n==Film location and venue==\nIn addition to serving as the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's 1997 TV miniseries version of ''The Shining'' (''see above''), the Stanley also served as the fictional \"Hotel Danbury\" of [[Aspen, Colorado]], in the 1994 film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''.<ref name=allstay>{{cite web|title=''Stanley Hotel Ghost Story|work=Allstays.com|url=http://www.allstays.com/Haunted/co_estespark_stanley.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the hotel property hosted the [[Stanley Film Festival]], an independent horror film festival operated by the Denver Film Society, held in early May.

Approximately five miles from the entrance to [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], the Stanley offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and especially [[Long's Peak]]. It was built by [[Freelan Oscar Stanley]] of [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Steamer]] fame and opened on July 4, 1909, as a resort for upper class easterners and a health retreat for sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis.<ref name=legends>{{cite web|title=The Haunted Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/stanley-hotel-colorado/|author= Kathy Weiser|work=LegendsOfAmerica.com|accessdate=Dec 24, 2018}}</ref> The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=nris />\n\nThe Stanley Hotel served as the inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] 1977 bestselling novel [[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] and as the filming location for the 1997 [[The Shining (miniseries)|TV miniseries]], also written by King. Today, the hotel features a restaurant, spa and bed-and-breakfast, and provides guided tours.\n\n==History==\nIn 1903, the Yankee [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|steam-powered car]] inventor  [[Freelan Oscar Stanley]] (1849\u20131940) was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=usparks>{{cite web|title=Rocky Mountain National Park - Culture|work=US-Parks.com|url=http://www.us-parks.com/rocky/culture.html|accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with lots of sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many \"[[Tuberculosis|lungers]]\" of his day, Stanley resolved to take the curative air of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He and his wife Flora arrived in [[Denver, Colorado]] in March and, in June, on the recommendation of Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney, relocated to [[Estes Park, Colorado]] for the rest of the summer. Over the course of the season, Stanley's health improved dramatically.<ref name=legends/> Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year. He lived to the ripe age of 91, dying of a heart attack in Newton, Massachusetts, one year after his wife, in 1940.\n\n[[File:4thEarlOfDunraven.jpg|thumb|left|The 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl]]\nBy 1907, Stanley had recovered completely. However, not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new summer home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the Hotel Stanley, a 48-room grand hotel that catered to the class of moderately wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys' social circle back east as well as to consumptives seeking the healthful climate.<ref name=usparks/>\n\nThe land was officially purchased in 1908 through the representatives of [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Lord Dunraven]], the [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer who had originally acquired it by stretching the provisions of the [[Homestead Act of 1862]] and [[Preemption Act of 1841|pre-emption rights]]. Between 1872 and 1884, Dunraven claimed {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} of the Estes Valley in an unsuccessful attempt to create a private hunting preserve, making him one of the largest foreign holders of American lands. Unpopular with the local ranchers and farmers, Dunraven left the area for the last time in 1884, relegating the ranch to the management of an overseer.<ref name=legends/><ref name=usparks/> Dunraven's presence in Colorado had become so well known in the United States that his situation was parodied in [[Charles King (general)|Charles King]]'s novel ''Dunraven Ranch'' (1892) as well as [[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'' (1974). His reputation was such that, when Stanley suggested \"The Dunraven\" as a name for his new hotel, 180 people signed a buckskin petition requesting that he name it for himself instead.\n\nThe main hotel and concert hall were completed in 1909 and the Manor in 1910. To bring guests from the nearest train depot in the foothills town of [[Lyons, Colorado]], Stanley's car company produced a fleet of specially-designed steam-powered vehicles called Mountain Wagons which seated 9 to 12 passengers.  Stanley operated the hotel almost as a pastime remarking once that he spent more money than he made each summer.\n\nIn 1926, Stanley sold his hotel to a private company incorporated for the sole purpose of running it. The venture failed and, in 1929, Stanley purchased his property out of foreclosure selling it again, in 1930, to fellow automobile and hotel magnate, Roe Emery of Denver. Until 1983, the resort was only open during the summer, shutting down for the winter every year. The presence of the hotel and Stanley's own involvement greatly contributed to the growth of Estes Park (incorporated in 1917) and the creation of the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] (established in 1915).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:The Stanley Hotel.JPG|June 2008\nFile:Stanley in Snow.JPG|February 2011\nFile:Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado.jpg|South elevation\nFile:StanleyHotelLobby.jpg|Lobby looking east\nFile:Music Room Stanley Hotel.JPG|Music room looking south\n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Larimer County, Colorado|Stanley Hotel National Register Historic District]] contains eleven contributing structures including the main hotel, the concert hall, a carriage house, manager's cottage, gate house and The Lodge\u2014a smaller bed-and-breakfast originally called Stanley Manor. The buildings were designed by F.O. Stanley with the professional assistance of Denver architect T. Robert Wieger, Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers, and contractor Frank Kirchoff. The site was chosen for its vantage overlooking the Estes valley and Long's Peak within the National Park. The main building, concert hall and Manor House are steel-frame structures on foundations of random rubble granite with clapboard siding and asphalt shingle roof. Originally, Stanley chose a yellow [[ocher]] color for the buildings' exteriors with white accents and trim. Lumber used in the structures was harvested from the areas of [[Bierstadt Lake]] and Hidden Valley in the future national park, and purchased from Kirchoff's Lumberyard in Denver and Bluff City Lumber Company of [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. The granite was quarried from the Baldwin property near the confluence of Beaver Brook and the Big Thompson River. Non-local materials were brought to Lyons, Colorado by rail and thence to Estes Park by mule-drawn wagon.\n\nUpon opening in 1909, the hotel was one of first in the country to be fully electrified from the lighting to the kitchens (although the light fixtures could be operated with either electricity or gas). To supply his hotel with power, Stanley led the construction of the Fall River Hydroplant which also brought electricity to the town of Estes Park for the first time. Every guest room had a telephone and each pair of rooms shared an ''en suite'' bathroom with running water supplied by Black Canyon Creek, which had been dammed in 1906. Circa 1935, during Roe Emery's tenure as owner the [[ochre]]-colored siding was painted white and most of the original electro-gas fixtures were replaced.\n\nAlthough the style of the hotel evokes the [[federal style]] architecture of New England, the general form and layout are designed to accommodate very high contemporary standards of hygiene and comfort. Given Stanley's interest in healthful living and his rational approach to architectural planning, he may have been inspired by the Carolina Hotel (built 1899\u20131900) in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]], designed by [[Bertrand E. Taylor]] (1856\u20131909)\u2014a national leader in hospital design and, like Stanley, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts. The parallels between the Carolina and the Stanley extend beyond architecture; the builder of the Carolina, [[James Walker Tufts]], was a Boston soda magnate who initially developed Pinehurst as a health resort for people with pulmonary diseases. Whether or not Stanley had exposure to Taylor's work and ideas, it is certain that he was influenced by Dr. Sherman Grant Bonney of the University of Denver, a contemporary expert in the treatment of tuberculosis; Stanley's Estes Park summer house is illustrated in Bonney's book, ''Pulmonary Tuberculosis'' (published while the hotel was under construction), and Stanley himself is acknowledged in the preface for his \"interest and efficiency in connection with the photographic illustrations.\" Although the hotel never operated as a sanitarium ''per se'', it was designed to be an optimal environment for pulmonary health. When the construction plans were announced, the ''Fort Collins Weekly Courier'' reported, \"[Estes Park] has been a favorite place for doctors to send the more robust of their patients, who were in shape to be braced up by the keen air and the considerable altitude, but it has not always been possible to get suitable accommodations and surroundings for them. With the park turned into a vast pleasure ground, and ample provisions for the best food products, all precious objections will be dissipated.\" Accordingly, the facilities were sited and designed to meet the requirements expounded in Bonney's book. For instance, according to Bonney,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"An ideal site for a sanitarium, or, in fact, for all buildings designed especially for pulmonary invalids, should be upon the southern slope of a hill or near the base of a moderately high mountain. In order to afford shelter from the prevailing winds, the building should be located according to regional weather conditions either to the east or the west of a spur extending southward. It is still more advantageous if the mountain rises to a considerable distance in the far background, even to a height of several hundred feet&nbsp;... The soil should be dry, porous and sandy although a rocky formation is not undesirable. On account of the necessity of irrigation in dry climates, no elaborate attempt should be made to beautify the grounds by laying out expansive lawns or by disposing flower-gardens in the immediate vicinity of the sanitarium, although such ornamentation adds greatly to the attractiveness of the institution. Undoubted benefit accrues to the invalid from a pleasing landscape. Attractive views, combining land and sky effect, contribute to a remarkable degree in breaking an unceasing monotony. Definite inspiration and elevation of spirits are not infrequently afforded by the sublimity of scenic grandeur witnessed in mountain resorts.\"<ref name=\"Bonney1908\">{{cite book|author=Sherman Grant Bonney|title=Pulmonary tuberculosis and its complications, with special reference to diagnosis and treatment|url=https://archive.org/details/pulmonarytuberc00bonngoog|quote=Bonney, Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Its Complications.|year=1908|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/pulmonarytuberc00bonngoog/page/n794 782]}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis text is accompanied by a photograph of \"the delightful view afforded from the porches of cottages for consumptives in Estes Park, Colorado.\" The hotel also provided the ample porches, ventilation, southern exposure, and appetizing food recommended in Bonney's book.\n\nThe style of the Stanley Hotel campus is [[colonial revival]]. The strong symmetrical arrangement of the primary facade, and the classically derived ornamental articulations such as the two-stage octagonal [[cupola]], [[Venetian Window|Palladian window]], [[fanlight]]s, [[dormer]]s, swan's neck [[pediment]]s, scroll [[bracket (architecture)|brackets]], paired [[Tuscan Order|Tuscan columns]], oval [[ox-eye window]]s, and elaborately turned [[baluster]]s are all stylistic hallmarks of [[Georgian architecture|American Georgian]] or [[Federal Style|Federal]] design. The clapboard siding and carved wood elements are characteristic of New England's regional building practices. And yet, these features are modified and arranged in ways that cannot be found in any historic example. These inaccuracies are due less to ignorance of historic design principles than a desire to utilize historical elements in light of modern design principles. By the 1920s, this approach to colonial revival design was supplanted by a more accurate use of historical details.\n\nThe style of the hotel contrasts sharply with the [[Rustic architecture|rustic style]] used for the other hotels in Estes Park, before and after the Stanley's construction. However, it was not an uncommon choice for a hotel of the Stanley's size and quality in the time period (e.g. [[Royal Poinciana Hotel]], [[Lake Yellowstone Hotel]], [[Mount Washington Hotel]]). In general, the colonial revival symbolized the unique historical development of the United States and its role in forming a unique American identity, characterized by the New England ethos and the political ideals of the founding fathers. These characteristics were supposed to be especially embodied by the traditional architecture of New England which was admired for its elegance and functionalism. Thus, everywhere the Colonial Revival was seen, it symbolized the progress of American Civilization based upon enduring traditional values. By the same token, the style of the Stanley was a reflection of the clientele's back-east gentility as well as an advertisement for the hotel's modern comforts and the future potential of Estes Park as a posh resort town. All of these connotations were heightened in contrast with the ruggedness of the Rocky Mountains and the rusticity of the other hotels in the area.   \n \n===Main building===\nThe floor plan of the main hotel (completed 1909) was laid out to accommodate the various activities popular with the American upper class at the turn of the twentieth century and the spaces are decorated accordingly. The music room, for instance, with its cream-colored walls (originally green and white), picture windows and fine, classical plaster-work was designed for letter-writing during the day and chamber music at night - cultured pursuits perceived as feminine. On the other hand, the smoking lounge (today the Pi\u00f1on Room) and adjoining billiard room, with their dark stained-wood elements and granite arch fireplace were designated for enjoyment by male guests. Stanley himself, having been raised in a calvinist household in the [[Maine Law|tee-totaling State of Maine]] and having recovered from a serious lung disease, did not smoke cigars or drink alcohol, but these were essential after-dinner activities for most men at the time. Billiards, however, was among Stanley's most cherished pastimes.\n\nWhen the hotel opened, it had 48 guest rooms, each with a telephone and each pair sharing a bathroom. With no central heating or ventilation system, the structure was designed to facilitate natural airflow; the Palladian window at the top of the grand stair could be opened to induce a cross-breeze through the lobby, French doors in all the public spaces open onto verandas, and two curving staircases connecting the guest corridors prevent stagnant air in the upper floors. Although the main hotel is now heated in the winter, guests still depend on natural ventilation for cooling in the summer. Within a few years of opening, a hydraulic elevator was put in operation. In 1916, the east wing of the main building was extended in the rear adding several guest rooms. Around this time, the alcove of the music room was added. In 1921, a rear veranda was enclosed forming a room that currently serves as a gift shop. Around 1935, the hydraulic elevator system was replaced with a cable-operated system and extended to the fourth floor necessitating the addition of a secondary cupola to house the mechanical apparatus. Originally, a porte-cochere extended from the central bay of the front porch, but this was removed when the south terrace was converted into a parking lot. In 1983, a service tunnel was excavated, connecting the basement-level corridor to the staff entrance. It is cut directly through the living granite on which the hotel rests.\n\n===Concert hall===\nThe concert hall, east of the hotel, was built by Stanley in 1909 with the assistance of Henry \"Lord Cornwallis\" Rogers, the same architect who designed his summer cottage. According to popular legend, it was built by F.O. Stanley as a gift for his wife, Flora. The interior is decorated in the same manner as the music room in the main hotel and vaguely resembles that of the [[Boston Symphony Hall]] ([[McKim, Mead & White]], 1900) with which the Stanleys would have been familiar. The stage features a trap door, used for theatrical entrances and exits. The lower level once housed a two-lane bowling alley which was removed during the ownership of Maxwell Abbell. It possibly resembled the bowling alley at the Stanley's Hunnewell Club in Newton, pictures of which are archived in the [[Newton Free Library]]. The hall underwent extensive repair and renovation in the 2000s.\n\n===The Lodge===\n[[File:Lodge at the Stanley Hotel Estes Park Colorado 2018.jpg|thumb|300px|The Lodge at the Stanley Hotel]]\nOnce called Stanley Manor, this smaller hotel between the main structure and the concert hall is a 2:3 scaled-down version of the main hotel. Unlike its model, the manor was fully heated from completion in 1910 which may indicate that Stanley planned to use it as a winter resort when the main building was closed for the season. However, unlike many other Colorado mountain towns now famous for their winter sports, Estes Park never attracted off-season visitors in Stanley's day and the manor remained empty for much of the year. Today it is called The Lodge and serves as a bed-and-breakfast that is off-limits to the public.\n\n==''The Shining''==\n{{Quote\n|text=Any big hotels have got scandals [sic]&nbsp;...

King had set the events of the book in an amusement park but he felt a more isolated setting was necessary. According to George Beahm's ''Stephen King Companion'', \"on the advisement of locals who suggested a resort hotel located in Estes Park, an hour's drive away to the north, Stephen and Tabitha King found themselves checking in at the Stanley Hotel just as its other guests were checking out, because the hotel was shutting down for the winter season. After checking in and after Tabitha went to bed, King roamed the halls and went down to the hotel bar, where drinks were served by a bartender named Grady. As he returned to his room, numbered 217, his imagination was fired up by the hotel's remote location, its grand size, and its eerie desolation. And when King went into the bathroom and pulled back the pink curtain for the tub, which had claw feet, he thought, 'What if somebody died here? At that moment, I knew I had a book.'\"<ref>{{cite book|author=George Beahm|title=''The Stephen King Companion: Four Decades of Fear from the Master of Horror.'' |location=New York|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|date= 2015 |pages=126\u201327}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1977 interview by the Literary Guild, King recounts, \"While we were living [in Boulder] we heard about this terrific old mountain resort hotel and decided to give it a try. But when we arrived, they were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the place\u2014with all those long, empty corridors.\" King and his wife were served dinner in an empty dining room accompanied by canned orchestral music: \"Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things. And by the time I went to bed that night, I had the whole book [''The Shining''] in my mind.\"<ref>Quoted in George Beahm, ''The Stephen King Companion''. (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 1989), 128.</ref> In another retelling, King says, \"I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of [[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] firmly set in my mind.\"<ref name=\"boogeyman\">George Beahm,''Stephen King: America's Best Loved Boogeyman'' (Andrews McMeel Press, 1998).</ref>\n\n[[The Shining (novel)|''The Shining'']] was published in 1977 and became the third great success of King's career after [[Carrie (novel)|''Carrie'']] and ''[['Salem's Lot]]''. The primary setting is an isolated Colorado resort called the Overlook Hotel which closes for the winter. In the front matter of the book, King tactfully states, \"Some of the most beautiful resort hotels in the world are located in Colorado, but the hotel in these pages is based on none of them. The Overlook and the people associated with it exist wholly in the author's imagination.\"<ref>Stephen King, ''The Shining'' (Doubleday, 1977)</ref> King locates the Overlook Hotel near the fictional town of Sidewinder which is supposed to be near Estes Park. The Stanley Hotel is never mentioned. Notwithstanding King's efforts to explicitly differentiate the Overlook Hotel from the Stanley, it seems that King imagined the Stanley Hotel as the setting of ''The Shining''. Room 217 of the Overlook features prominently in the novel, having been the room where King spent the night at the Stanley. This is the room on the second floor in the center of the west wing with a balcony overlooking the south terrace. Room 217 remains the Stanley's most requested accommodation.\n\nDespite its connection with Stephen King's novel, the Stanley Hotel has little to do with [[Stanley Kubrick's]] iconic 1980 [[The Shining (film)|film adaptation]]. Kubrick's vision for the movie differed significantly from King's in many ways, including the portrayal of the Overlook Hotel. The exteriors of Kubrick's Overlook were supplied by the [[Timberline Lodge]] (built 1936\u201338) near Mt. Hood in Oregon and inspiration for the interior sets (erected at [[Elstree Studios]] in the UK) came primarily from the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] (built 1927) in [[Yosemite National Park]]. The management of the Timberline Lodge, fearful that guests would refuse to stay in their Room 217 if it were featured in a horror movie, insisted that Kubrick change the haunted room in the film to the fictional Room 237.\n\nKing was apparently displeased with Kubrick's film, based mainly on [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of Jack Torrance. In 1996, Warner Brothers secured the television rights to ''The Shining'' and produced a miniseries (stylized as \"[[The Shining (TV miniseries)|Stephen King's The Shining]]\") with a script by Stephen King. Thanks to King, the Stanley Hotel was chosen as the primary shooting location. A playhouse version of the main building which adorned the lawn of the Overlook Hotel in the series can be viewed in the basement of the Stanley.\n\n===The hedge maze===\n\nIn 2015, the open area in front of the hotel, originally a driveway for Stanley Steamers and a promenade for guests to enjoy mountain views, was replaced with a hedge maze. This non-historic feature was added to evoke the hotel's connection to ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. Although a hedge maze features prominently in Stanley Kubrick's film, no such feature appears in King's novel. The lawn of the Overlook Hotel, as King imagined it, was adorned with [[topiary]] animals and it was set that way for the shooting of [[The Shining (miniseries)|''Stephen King's The Shining'']]. Historically, neither existed at the Stanley. The design was the result of a competition, chosen from amongst 300 entrants from across the globe. The following year, another competition was held to design a focal point for the hedge maze. Sculptors Sutton Betti and Daniel Glanz won the competition with a sculpture of F.O. Stanley holding one of his violins. The sculpture was installed and dedicated on September 29, 2016.\n\n==Film location and venue==\nIn addition to serving as the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's 1997 TV miniseries version of ''The Shining'' (''see above''), the Stanley also served as the fictional \"Hotel Danbury\" of [[Aspen, Colorado]], in the 1994 film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''.<ref name=allstay>{{cite web|title=''Stanley Hotel Ghost Story|work=Allstays.com|url=http://www.allstays.com/Haunted/co_estespark_stanley.htm|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the hotel property hosted the [[Stanley Film Festival]], an independent horror film festival operated by the Denver Film Society, held in early May.

During the Ava period, its governors and viceroys raised multiple rebellions (1427\u20131428, 1437\u20131442, 1451\u20131458 and 1468\u20131470), each time with clandestine or open help from Hanthawaddy, which wanted to keep Ava unstable.\n\nIronically, Toungoo would repay by attacking Hanthawaddy itself. Circa 1494, Toungoo, then still a vassal of Ava, raided Hanthawaddy's territory, taking advantage of the larger kingdom's succession crisis. But Hanthawaddy's new king [[Binnya Ran II]] retaliated by laying siege to Toungoo in 1495\u20131496.<ref name=sll-59-60>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 59\u201360</ref> Toungoo barely survived the siege; [[Mingyi Nyo]], [[List of rulers of Toungoo|viceroy of Toungoo]], would not provoke the larger neighbor for the remainder of his life.<ref name=geh-124>Harvey 1925: 124\u2013125</ref> After he declared independence from Ava in 1510, Mingyi Nyo largely stayed out of the fighting raging between Ava and the [[Confederation of Shan States]]. When Ava fell to the combined forces of the Confederation and Prome in 1527, many people fled to Toungoo, the only region in Upper Burma at peace.<ref name=geh-124/>\n\nBut Toungoo could not stay out of the warfare forever. War arrived uncomfortably close to Toungoo in 1532\u20131533 when the Confederation of Shan States, already ruling much of Upper Burma, attacked its erstwhile ally Prome, and sacked the city.<ref name=hy-2-215>Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 215</ref> Although the Confederation was content to keep Prome as a vassal, the Toungoo leadership was concerned that their city east of Prome on the same latitude, separated only by the Pegu Yoma range, was an \"obvious next target.\"<ref name=jf-356>Fernquest 2005: 356</ref> Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by the leadership change after its principal leader [[Sawlon]] of [[Mohnyin]] was assassinated in 1533. Moreover, Toungoo's remote hard-to-reach location proved an asset. Unlike Prome, which sits on the Irrawaddy river, Toungoo was tucked away behind the Pegu Yoma range and was not connected to Upper Burma by any major water way, presenting a difficult logistical challenge for potential invaders. Meanwhile, refugees continued to flee to Toungoo, still the only kingdom unaffected by war. The little principality now commanded considerably more manpower than its traditional base allowed for, and it would soon punch above its weight.<ref name=geh-153>Harvey 1925: 153</ref> The Toungoo leadership decided that their kingdom \"had to act quickly if it wished to avoid being swallowed up\" by the confederation.<ref name=jf-356/>\n\nTabinshwehti and his court selected Hanthawaddy as their first target because its king [[Takayutpi]] was a weak leader who did not command respect of his vassals. Takayutpi's brother-in-law [[Saw Binnya]] practically ruled [[Mottama|Martaban]] region like a sovereign, and scarcely acknowledged the high king at [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (Bago). Takayutpi in turned made an alliance with the [[Prome Kingdom]], a vassal of the Confederation.\n\n==Initial raids (1534\u20131537)==\nThe war began in late 1534<ref group=note>Chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 185) simply say that the war began in 896 ME (30 March 1534 \u2013 29 March 1535). The war likely began in November 1534 since Burmese kings almost always fought in the dry season (November to May).</ref> when a landlocked Toungoo led by [[Tabinshwehti]] and his deputy [[Bayinnaung]], tried to break out of its increasingly narrow zone by launching a [[preemptive war]] against a weakly led Hanthawaddy. In the beginning, Toungoo's maneuvers amounted to a mere raids of Hanthawaddy territory, and its initial dry-season raids in 1534\u20131535, 1535\u20131536, and 1536\u20131537 all failed against Pegu's fortified defenses aided by foreign mercenaries and firearms. In each campaign, Toungoo armies had only 6000 to 7000 men, a few hundred cavalry and a few dozen war elephants and did not yet have access to foreign troops and firearms.<ref name=hy-2-185>Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 185\u2013187</ref>\n\nUnlike his father Binnya Ran II, King [[Takayutpi]] of Hanthawaddy could not organize any retaliatory action. His nominal subordinates in the [[Irrawaddy delta]] and Martaban did not send any help. Nonetheless, Pegu's defenses led by two leading ministers of the court, [[Binnya Law]] and [[Binnya Kyan (minister)|Binnya Kyan]] withstood the raids.\n\n==Coup de grace (1538\u20131539)==\n\n===Pegu===\nToungoo used a [[stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] to create a split in the Hanthawaddy camp, providing misinformation about the loyalty of the ministers. Surprisingly, Takayutpi believed Toungoo's misinformation, and executed the ministers who had been his tutors since childhood and were absolutely devoted to him.<ref name=mha-106-109>Htin Aung 1967: 106\u2013109</ref> Then when Toungoo launched another invasion in late 1538, with 7000 troops, Takayutpi was helpless, and decided to evacuate his capital rather than fight. Toungoo forces took Pegu without firing a shot.\n\nThe most telling part of the state of disarray of the once powerful kingdom was that Takayutpi and his armies chose to retreat to Prome, another kingdom, rather than to their own territory of Martaban whose ruler Takayutpi simply did not trust.<ref name=mha-109>Htin Aung 1967: 109</ref> The course of retreat was through the Irrawaddy delta. The direct route from Pegu to Prome, though much shorter, involved crossing the Bago Yoma range, and was not practical for large armies. Takayutpi divided the retreating Hanthawaddy forces into two. Five divisions of the army marched by land. Takayutpi and the remaining troops sailed by river in 700 boats.<ref name=hy-2-188-192>Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 188\u2013192</ref>\n\n===Battle of Naungyo===\n{{Main|Battle of Naungyo}}\n\nAt Pegu, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung well understood that they had gained Pegu only through a ruse, and that Hanthawaddy's military had not been defeated yet. Their top priority was to meet and defeat the Hanthawaddy army before they got inside the fortified walls of Prome. They knew that a large body of enemy inside walls with better leadership would pose a major problem for their tenuous hold on Lower Burma. Tabinshwehti sent Bayinnaung with a small army to chase the retreating army while he sailed up to Prome with his flotilla of war boats to chase Takayutpi's flotilla.<ref name=mha-106-109>Htin Aung 1967: 106\u2013109</ref>\n\nBayinnaung's light troops caught up with the main Hanthawaddy armies led by Gen. Binnya Dala and Gen. Minye Aung Naing near [[Einme Township|Naungyo]] in the Irrawaddy delta. Bayinnaung nonetheless defeated the numerically superior and better armed force. Only a small portion of the Hanthawaddy forces made it to Prome. A decimated Hanthawaddy was no longer in a position to retake the lost territories from Toungoo.<ref name=mha-106-109/><ref name=geh-154>Harvey 1925: 154</ref>\n\n===Battle of Prome===\nAfter Pegu's improbable fall, the Shan Confederation, which ruled the former [[Ava Kingdom]], finally took notice. When Toungoo's armies later attacked its vassal Prome, the Confederation sent in troops and broke the siege. Toungoo retreated but soon gained the allegiance of many [[Mon people|Mon]] lords, and manpower after Hanthawaddy's king [[Takayutpi]] died a few months later.\n\n==Martaban (1540\u20131541)==\n\n===Preparations===\nToungoo now held two out of the three Hanthawaddy provinces (the Irrawaddy delta and Pegu) but Martaban remained independent. The viceroy of Martaban, who had always acted like a sovereign, had declared himself king of Hanthawaddy since the death of Takayutpi.<ref name=mha-109/> Tabinshwehti sent an ultimatum to Martaban and its vassals to submit in exchange for amnesty but Saw Binnya refused. He had fortified the wealthy port, and enlisted Portuguese mercenaries and seven warships led by [[Paulo de Seixas]], guarded the harbor.<ref name=geh-155>Harvey 1925: 155</ref> Martaban's vassals wavered. The governor of Moulmein did not submit to Tabinshwehti but agreed not to provide any help to Martaban.<ref name=sll-179-181>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179\u2013181</ref>\n\n===Siege===\nIn November 1540, 13,000-strong Toungoo land and naval forces attacked the city.<ref name=sll-178>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 178</ref> Toungoo forces now included 700 Portuguese mercenaries led by [[Jo\u00e3o Caeiro]] (Joano Cayeyro) who brought light artillery and muskets. However, the wealthy port's strong fortifications backed by Portuguese artillery and musket fire kept besiegers at bay. Toungoo's light Portuguese artillery proved \"useless against ramparts backed by earthwork,\" and its \"navy\" of small war boats could not impose a complete blockade on the seven Portuguese ships guarding the harbor.<ref name=geh-155/> The Toungoo command tried to complete the blockade about a month into the siege by sending in 300 war boats to storm the harbor but the venture ended badly, with most boats destroyed by the guns of the Portuguese ships.<ref name=sll-179>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179</ref>\n\nFor the next few months, Toungoo forces continued the siege from afar but the Toungoo command was concerned by the fast approaching rainy season. Even though the first naval attack failed, Adm. [[Smim Payu]] convinced Tabinshwehti, who was personally leading the siege, that their best chance for a breakthrough still lay in another naval attack. The king accepted the plan. The admiral went up the [[Salween river]] with thousands of men, and built two types of rafts. One type contained bamboo towers higher than the walls of the port. The others were fire-rafts.<ref name=geh-156-157>Harvey 1925: 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nWhile Toungoo forces prepared for the final assault, the city was starving. Saw Binnya finally offered to surrender provided that he be allowed to remain viceroy in exchange for an annual tribute of 30,000 [[viss]] (48,987.9&nbsp;kg) of silver bullion and other valuable presents. Tabinshwehti rejected the offer, demanding an unconditional surrender instead. Saw Binnya then asked for safe-conduct out of the city for himself and his entire family, together with his treasures. It too was rejected by the Burmese king. In desperation, Saw Binnya appealed to the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Portuguese viceroy at Goa]] for assistance, offering to become a vassal of Goa, in addition to an outright gift of half the amount of his treasure. The Portuguese were interested. A Portuguese captain listed the treasure as consisting of two shiploads of gold and silver, and 26 chests of precious stones. In addition, gold to be looted from the city's pagodas would fill 4 ships. But the Portuguese also feared the vengeance of Tabinshwehti, the new power in Lower Burma, and \"wavered between greed and prudence\".<ref name=mha-110>Htin Aung 1967: 110</ref> At the same time, Saw Binnya offered a large bribe to Caeiro to help him and his family escape. Caeiro seriously considered the overly generous offer but ultimately declined the offer as his deputies found out the proposal and threatened to report the matter to Tabinshwehti.<ref name=geh-156-157/>\n\n===Final assault===\nWhile Saw Binnya was exhausting all his options, the Toungoo command was determined to sack the city before the rainy season. In May 1541, seven months into the siege, Smim Payu launched the second attack on the harbor. Several fire-rafts \"with flames higher than a toddy tree\" came floating down the river toward the Portuguese ships. Three of the seven Portuguese ships fled to the sea. The remaining four ships were either burned or captured. Then the rafts with mounted bamboo towers, crammed with troops and musketeers, slipped past the wreckage, and made it to the wall by the harbor. The Toungoo troops, who were exchanging musket fire with the defenders on the wall, then jumped over the wall and soon won a foothold.<ref name=geh-156-157/><ref name=mha-110/> A section of the wall was mined and brought down. Inside the city, the defenders fought on, with Saw Binnya personally leading the fight on his war elephant.<ref name=sll-182-184>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 182\u2013184</ref> But they were soon overwhelmed. The sack raged for three days. Tabinshwehti ordered the execution of the viceroy, his family, and all the \"gallant\" defenders for they had refused his prior offer of amnesty. The mass execution had the desired effect. The governors of [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmein]] (Mawlaymyaing) and southern territories (present-day [[Mon State]]), abutting then Siamese frontier submitted.<ref name=geh-156-157/><ref name=mha-110/>\n\n==Significance==\nThe war was a crucial turning point in the history of Myanmar as well as in the history of mainland Southeast Asia. Toungoo's victory gave the upstart kingdom complete control of coastal Lower Burma's manpower, access to foreign firearms and maritime wealth to pay for them.<ref name=vbl-151>Lieberman 2003: 151</ref><ref name=geh-154-155>Harvey 1925: 154\u2013155</ref> Toungoo kings would leverage these new found assets for further expansions in the remainder of the century, and build the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. Moreover, Toungoo's success in breaking out of an increasingly narrow dry zone not only saved the only remaining ethnic Burman-led kingdom from extinction but also ensured the continued rise of Burman culture and Burmese language in the Irrawaddy valley.<ref name=vbl-155-164>Lieberman 2003: 155\u2013164</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal | last=Fernquest | first=Jon | url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64387.pdf | title=Min-gyi-nyo, the Shan Invasions of Ava (1524\u201327), and the Beginnings of Expansionary Warfare in Toungoo Burma: 1486\u20131539 | work=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research | volume=3 | number=2 | date=Autumn 2005}}\n* {{cite book | last=Harvey | first= G.

The little principality now commanded considerably more manpower than its traditional base allowed for, and it would soon punch above its weight.<ref name=geh-153>Harvey 1925: 153</ref> The Toungoo leadership decided that their kingdom \"had to act quickly if it wished to avoid being swallowed up\" by the confederation.<ref name=jf-356/>\n\nTabinshwehti and his court selected Hanthawaddy as their first target because its king [[Takayutpi]] was a weak leader who did not command respect of his vassals. Takayutpi's brother-in-law [[Saw Binnya]] practically ruled [[Mottama|Martaban]] region like a sovereign, and scarcely acknowledged the high king at [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (Bago). Takayutpi in turned made an alliance with the [[Prome Kingdom]], a vassal of the Confederation.\n\n==Initial raids (1534\u20131537)==\nThe war began in late 1534<ref group=note>Chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 185) simply say that the war began in 896 ME (30 March 1534 \u2013 29 March 1535). The war likely began in November 1534 since Burmese kings almost always fought in the dry season (November to May).</ref> when a landlocked Toungoo led by [[Tabinshwehti]] and his deputy [[Bayinnaung]], tried to break out of its increasingly narrow zone by launching a [[preemptive war]] against a weakly led Hanthawaddy. In the beginning, Toungoo's maneuvers amounted to a mere raids of Hanthawaddy territory, and its initial dry-season raids in 1534\u20131535, 1535\u20131536, and 1536\u20131537 all failed against Pegu's fortified defenses aided by foreign mercenaries and firearms. In each campaign, Toungoo armies had only 6000 to 7000 men, a few hundred cavalry and a few dozen war elephants and did not yet have access to foreign troops and firearms.<ref name=hy-2-185>Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 185\u2013187</ref>\n\nUnlike his father Binnya Ran II, King [[Takayutpi]] of Hanthawaddy could not organize any retaliatory action. His nominal subordinates in the [[Irrawaddy delta]] and Martaban did not send any help. Nonetheless, Pegu's defenses led by two leading ministers of the court, [[Binnya Law]] and [[Binnya Kyan (minister)|Binnya Kyan]] withstood the raids.\n\n==Coup de grace (1538\u20131539)==\n\n===Pegu===\nToungoo used a [[stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] to create a split in the Hanthawaddy camp, providing misinformation about the loyalty of the ministers. Surprisingly, Takayutpi believed Toungoo's misinformation, and executed the ministers who had been his tutors since childhood and were absolutely devoted to him.<ref name=mha-106-109>Htin Aung 1967: 106\u2013109</ref> Then when Toungoo launched another invasion in late 1538, with 7000 troops, Takayutpi was helpless, and decided to evacuate his capital rather than fight. Toungoo forces took Pegu without firing a shot.\n\nThe most telling part of the state of disarray of the once powerful kingdom was that Takayutpi and his armies chose to retreat to Prome, another kingdom, rather than to their own territory of Martaban whose ruler Takayutpi simply did not trust.<ref name=mha-109>Htin Aung 1967: 109</ref> The course of retreat was through the Irrawaddy delta. The direct route from Pegu to Prome, though much shorter, involved crossing the Bago Yoma range, and was not practical for large armies. Takayutpi divided the retreating Hanthawaddy forces into two. Five divisions of the army marched by land. Takayutpi and the remaining troops sailed by river in 700 boats.<ref name=hy-2-188-192>Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 188\u2013192</ref>\n\n===Battle of Naungyo===\n{{Main|Battle of Naungyo}}\n\nAt Pegu, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung well understood that they had gained Pegu only through a ruse, and that Hanthawaddy's military had not been defeated yet. Their top priority was to meet and defeat the Hanthawaddy army before they got inside the fortified walls of Prome. They knew that a large body of enemy inside walls with better leadership would pose a major problem for their tenuous hold on Lower Burma. Tabinshwehti sent Bayinnaung with a small army to chase the retreating army while he sailed up to Prome with his flotilla of war boats to chase Takayutpi's flotilla.<ref name=mha-106-109>Htin Aung 1967: 106\u2013109</ref>\n\nBayinnaung's light troops caught up with the main Hanthawaddy armies led by Gen. Binnya Dala and Gen. Minye Aung Naing near [[Einme Township|Naungyo]] in the Irrawaddy delta. Bayinnaung nonetheless defeated the numerically superior and better armed force. Only a small portion of the Hanthawaddy forces made it to Prome. A decimated Hanthawaddy was no longer in a position to retake the lost territories from Toungoo.<ref name=mha-106-109/><ref name=geh-154>Harvey 1925: 154</ref>\n\n===Battle of Prome===\nAfter Pegu's improbable fall, the Shan Confederation, which ruled the former [[Ava Kingdom]], finally took notice. When Toungoo's armies later attacked its vassal Prome, the Confederation sent in troops and broke the siege. Toungoo retreated but soon gained the allegiance of many [[Mon people|Mon]] lords, and manpower after Hanthawaddy's king [[Takayutpi]] died a few months later.\n\n==Martaban (1540\u20131541)==\n\n===Preparations===\nToungoo now held two out of the three Hanthawaddy provinces (the Irrawaddy delta and Pegu) but Martaban remained independent. The viceroy of Martaban, who had always acted like a sovereign, had declared himself king of Hanthawaddy since the death of Takayutpi.<ref name=mha-109/> Tabinshwehti sent an ultimatum to Martaban and its vassals to submit in exchange for amnesty but Saw Binnya refused. He had fortified the wealthy port, and enlisted Portuguese mercenaries and seven warships led by [[Paulo de Seixas]], guarded the harbor.<ref name=geh-155>Harvey 1925: 155</ref> Martaban's vassals wavered. The governor of Moulmein did not submit to Tabinshwehti but agreed not to provide any help to Martaban.<ref name=sll-179-181>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179\u2013181</ref>\n\n===Siege===\nIn November 1540, 13,000-strong Toungoo land and naval forces attacked the city.<ref name=sll-178>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 178</ref> Toungoo forces now included 700 Portuguese mercenaries led by [[Jo\u00e3o Caeiro]] (Joano Cayeyro) who brought light artillery and muskets. However, the wealthy port's strong fortifications backed by Portuguese artillery and musket fire kept besiegers at bay. Toungoo's light Portuguese artillery proved \"useless against ramparts backed by earthwork,\" and its \"navy\" of small war boats could not impose a complete blockade on the seven Portuguese ships guarding the harbor.<ref name=geh-155/> The Toungoo command tried to complete the blockade about a month into the siege by sending in 300 war boats to storm the harbor but the venture ended badly, with most boats destroyed by the guns of the Portuguese ships.<ref name=sll-179>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 179</ref>\n\nFor the next few months, Toungoo forces continued the siege from afar but the Toungoo command was concerned by the fast approaching rainy season. Even though the first naval attack failed, Adm. [[Smim Payu]] convinced Tabinshwehti, who was personally leading the siege, that their best chance for a breakthrough still lay in another naval attack. The king accepted the plan. The admiral went up the [[Salween river]] with thousands of men, and built two types of rafts. One type contained bamboo towers higher than the walls of the port. The others were fire-rafts.<ref name=geh-156-157>Harvey 1925: 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nWhile Toungoo forces prepared for the final assault, the city was starving. Saw Binnya finally offered to surrender provided that he be allowed to remain viceroy in exchange for an annual tribute of 30,000 [[viss]] (48,987.9&nbsp;kg) of silver bullion and other valuable presents. Tabinshwehti rejected the offer, demanding an unconditional surrender instead. Saw Binnya then asked for safe-conduct out of the city for himself and his entire family, together with his treasures. It too was rejected by the Burmese king. In desperation, Saw Binnya appealed to the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Portuguese viceroy at Goa]] for assistance, offering to become a vassal of Goa, in addition to an outright gift of half the amount of his treasure. The Portuguese were interested. A Portuguese captain listed the treasure as consisting of two shiploads of gold and silver, and 26 chests of precious stones. In addition, gold to be looted from the city's pagodas would fill 4 ships. But the Portuguese also feared the vengeance of Tabinshwehti, the new power in Lower Burma, and \"wavered between greed and prudence\".<ref name=mha-110>Htin Aung 1967: 110</ref> At the same time, Saw Binnya offered a large bribe to Caeiro to help him and his family escape. Caeiro seriously considered the overly generous offer but ultimately declined the offer as his deputies found out the proposal and threatened to report the matter to Tabinshwehti.<ref name=geh-156-157/>\n\n===Final assault===\nWhile Saw Binnya was exhausting all his options, the Toungoo command was determined to sack the city before the rainy season. In May 1541, seven months into the siege, Smim Payu launched the second attack on the harbor. Several fire-rafts \"with flames higher than a toddy tree\" came floating down the river toward the Portuguese ships. Three of the seven Portuguese ships fled to the sea. The remaining four ships were either burned or captured. Then the rafts with mounted bamboo towers, crammed with troops and musketeers, slipped past the wreckage, and made it to the wall by the harbor. The Toungoo troops, who were exchanging musket fire with the defenders on the wall, then jumped over the wall and soon won a foothold.<ref name=geh-156-157/><ref name=mha-110/> A section of the wall was mined and brought down. Inside the city, the defenders fought on, with Saw Binnya personally leading the fight on his war elephant.<ref name=sll-182-184>Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 182\u2013184</ref> But they were soon overwhelmed. The sack raged for three days. Tabinshwehti ordered the execution of the viceroy, his family, and all the \"gallant\" defenders for they had refused his prior offer of amnesty. The mass execution had the desired effect. The governors of [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmein]] (Mawlaymyaing) and southern territories (present-day [[Mon State]]), abutting then Siamese frontier submitted.<ref name=geh-156-157/><ref name=mha-110/>\n\n==Significance==\nThe war was a crucial turning point in the history of Myanmar as well as in the history of mainland Southeast Asia. Toungoo's victory gave the upstart kingdom complete control of coastal Lower Burma's manpower, access to foreign firearms and maritime wealth to pay for them.<ref name=vbl-151>Lieberman 2003: 151</ref><ref name=geh-154-155>Harvey 1925: 154\u2013155</ref> Toungoo kings would leverage these new found assets for further expansions in the remainder of the century, and build the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. Moreover, Toungoo's success in breaking out of an increasingly narrow dry zone not only saved the only remaining ethnic Burman-led kingdom from extinction but also ensured the continued rise of Burman culture and Burmese language in the Irrawaddy valley.<ref name=vbl-155-164>Lieberman 2003: 155\u2013164</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal | last=Fernquest | first=Jon | url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64387.pdf | title=Min-gyi-nyo, the Shan Invasions of Ava (1524\u201327), and the Beginnings of Expansionary Warfare in Toungoo Burma: 1486\u20131539 | work=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research | volume=3 | number=2 | date=Autumn 2005}}\n* {{cite book | last=Harvey | first= G.
