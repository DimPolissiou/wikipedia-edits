The Toronto Fire Services is currently the largest municipal fire department in Canada.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bedford Park Volunteer Fire Brigade, Toronto ca. 1900.jpg|left|thumb|The Bedford Park Volunteer Fire Brigade, c. 1900. Early fire services in Toronto consisted primarily of volunteer fire companies.]]\nFire services in Toronto began in 1874 in the former City of Toronto, and still consisted of volunteer fire companies. Prior to 1874, fire services were composed of poorly trained volunteer companies in the city. The first company was created in 1826 and hook and ladder in 1831. Most were able bodied men who were trained to operate pumps to draw water from the lake. A wooden pumper truck presented to Toronto by British America Assurance Company c.1837 is now found at [[Black Creek Pioneer Village]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bukharov/5225278226|title=Fire House c.1850. Black Creek Pioneer Village. Toronto, Canada|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe city's poor fire fighting services were highlighted by the [[Great Fire of Toronto (1849)|Great Toronto Fire]] in 1849 and again in the [[Great Fire of Toronto (1904)|Great Fire of Toronto]] in 1904. After the latter fire, which destroyed much of [[Bay Street]] from The Esplanade West to Melinda Street, the Fire Department in Toronto became a critical city service and has evolved into the full-time service that exists today.\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services was created in 1998 from the merger of the former fire departments of the [[Toronto (former)|original City of Toronto]], [[East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] and [[York, Toronto|York]]. It is the largest fire department in Canada{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and the 5th largest municipal fire department in North America.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Weston Fire Department, Home Inspection Unit (19504853571).jpg|thumb|The Weston Fire Department served [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] until it was absorbed by [[York, Toronto|York]] Fire Department. The York Fire Department was itself amalgamated with other Toronto fire services in 1998.]]\nAs part of the City's 2013 Budget plans, the City of Toronto demanded a 10% cut by all city departments. TFS, under then Fire Chief James Sales, recommended vehicle reductions at several stations (Stations 213, 215, 324 and 413) and one station to close (Station 424) to meet the 10% reduction target.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/12/07/west-end-fire-station-trucks-closure216.html|title=Closures report | work=CBC News}}</ref> As well the cuts will lead to fewer firefighters on staff.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\"/>\n\nIn 2014, four pumpers (P213, P215, P413, P424) were taken out of service and Station 424 was shut down.\n\nIn 2017, under Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, the TFS Transformation Plan was developed and introduced, which included a comprehensive Inclusion Plan.

The first motorized pumper was placed in the College St station on October 18, 1911. Before that, the TFD and previous fire companies used horse drawn engines and ladders. Prior to the 1970s, the TFD had open air vehicles (driver cab not covered and mostly aerial trucks), but since then both the TFD and TFS use full covered vehicles. Prior to the 1950s, TFD used tiller-ladder trucks and since have reverted to smaller aerial units that can operate in narrow streets in Toronto.\n\nThe TFS inherited all the vehicles of the fire departments prior to amalgamation. The current strength of TFS consists of 179 vehicles. Since amalgamation, apparatus numbers are numbered by a letter and 3 digits. The first digit stands for the command that the apparatus is in (1-North, 2-East, 3-South, 4-West). The second digit stands for the district within the command that the apparatus is in. The last digit stands for the station within the district within the command that the apparatus is assigned to.\n\nA list of types of vehicles used by the TFS: (prefix letter in brackets with \"xxx\" as placeholders) is listed below:\n{{col div}}\n* [[Fire Engine#Aerial Apparatus|Aerial]] (Axxx) - most common ladders found in the city; lengths range from 75 to 105&nbsp;feet (22.86 to 32&nbsp;metres)\n* Tower (Txxx) - 2 articulated boom ladders, with 1 found in South and 1 in North Command; length 114&nbsp;feet (34.75&nbsp;metres); T331 is now a spare\n* Platform (PLxxx) - 1 ladder with attached platform, found in West Command; length 100&nbsp;feet (30.48&nbsp;metres)\n* Pumper (Pxxx)\n* Rescue (Rescue Pumper) (Rxxx) - a pumper with the addition of extrication equipment ([[Jaws of Life]]) and other tools\n* [[Fireboat]] (FBxxx) - 2 units, both stationed in Toronto Harbour\n* [[Hazardous materials apparatus|Hazardous Materials Unit]] (HAZxxx) - 1 in both North and South Commands\n* Hazmat Support Unit (HSxxx) - Unmanned equipment vehicle\n* Decontamination Unit (DExxx)\n* [[Heavy rescue vehicle|Squad]] (Sxxx) - heavy/technical rescue units, with 2 located in South Command and 1 in each of West, North, and East Commands\n* High Rise Unit (HRxxx) - 1 only, in South Command\n* Water Tanker (WTxxx) - 1 only, in East Command\n* Rapid Attack Vehicle - 1 only, on [[Toronto Islands]]\n* All-Terrain Vehicle (ATVx) - used at special events, such as the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]\n* [[Trench rescue|Trench Rescue]] Support Truck (TRSxxx) - 1 only, in East Command\n* [[Light and air unit|Air/Light Unit]] (LAxxx) - 1 in each Command (A/L 111, A/L 231, A/L 333, A/L 421)\n* District Chief (Cxx)\n* Platoon Chief (Cx0) - 1 in each Command (C10, C20, C30, C40)\n* Division Commander (Cx)\n* Deputy Chief / Fire Chief (Cx)\n* [[Fire Engine#Command Support Unit|Command]] (CMDxx) - 3 throughout the city\n* Mechanical Response Unit (MRUxxx)\n* Training Aerial (TRAx) - used by Professional Development and Training\n* Training Pumper (TRPx) - used by Professional Development and Training\n* Spare vehicles (X5xxx) - non-permanent additional vehicles added to station\n* Fire Investigator (FIx)\n{{col div end}}\n====Fire boats====\n{{Main|Fireboats of Toronto}}\nThe Toronto Fire Department and successor Toronto Fire Services has operated fire boats since 1923. Fireboat ''Charles A. Reed'' was the first fireboat operated by the service, and was a wood hull boat that entered service in 1923 and remained in use until 1964.<ref>Discover & explore Toronto's waterfront, [[Mike Filey]], pp34</ref>\n[[File:WLMK Fireboat.JPG|thumb|left|Fireboat ''[[William Lyon Mackenzie (fireboat)|William Lyon Mackenzie]]'' is one of two fireboats presently operated by the Toronto Fire Services]]\nThe service presently has two fireboats in service. Fireboat ''[[William Lyon Mackenzie (fireboat)|William Lyon Mackenzie]]'' entered service in 1964, replacing Charles A. Reed. Fireboat ''William Lyon Mackenzie'' serves as the department's main fireboat and icebreaker. In 2006, the Toronto Fire Services acquired Fireboat ''Sora'', a light utility boat built in 1982 for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]]. The Sora was retired from TFS on October 31, 2015, replaced by Fireboat ''William Thornton''. Fireboat ''William Thornton is a mid-shore patrol built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard, and was acquired by the Toronto Fire Service in 2015.\n\n====Miscellaneous units====\nWhile not part of the fleet, Box 12 (Box 12 Association) and Support 7 (Greater Toronto Multiple Alarm Association) are canteen trucks run by volunteers and are present at large emergencies to provide food and beverages for Toronto firefighters.\n\nFormed in 1949, the Box 12 Association is Toronto\u2019s oldest fire canteen unit, and serves firefighters in the west end and the downtown core. The unit is named after alarm box #12, which was pulled to trigger the response to the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. This canteen has served in a number of high profile multiple alarm fires in recent history, including the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto six alarm fire in 2017. The Box 12 Association celebrated 70 years of continuous volunteer service in 2018, with Mayor John Tory in attendance. Each year, an award named after this canteen is presented by the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters Association to a fire service member for voluntarism.\n\nFormed in 1975, the GTMAA vehicle is painted with TFD scheme, but not the logo (using the GTMAA patch instead). \n\nIn addition, there are various Hazardous Materials Support trucks and a Trench Rescue Support truck that respond to specialized calls. These trucks are unmanned, and are only used by trained personnel when a specialized call is dispatched. TFS also has a fleet of various mechanical support trucks. Smaller compact cars bearing the TFS colours and logo are driven by fire prevention officers and other commanding officers.\n\nToronto Fire will also acquire use of the [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]. It was one of three purchased by the [[Toronto Police Service]] for use during the G20 summit in 2010 (1 for Marine Unit, 2 for Public Safety Unit).<ref>[http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/111923--police-will-keep-g20-sound-cannons Police Will Keep G20 Sound Cannons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126192742/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/111923--police-will-keep-g20-sound-cannons |date=2012-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nToronto Fire Services operates and manages both the Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) team and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) response team on behalf of the City of Toronto and under contract with the Province of Ontario for Provincial deployment as required as CAN-TF3.\n\nPrior to amalgamation, the Scarborough Fire Department had their fleet painted yellow. In the years following amalgamation the markings on the fire trucks were a patchwork of the various schemes used by the former boroughs. All had \"Toronto\" decaled or painted where the former borough's name used to be and the new Toronto Fire crest was added with the new numbering scheme. Over the past 19&nbsp;years - post amalgamation - the majority of the older vehicles have either been retired or repainted to match the new scheme: fire engine red with yellow reflective trim and markings.\n\n==Fire stations==\nThe Toronto Fire Services (TFS) currently operates out of 83 Fire Stations (including one open seasonally) throughout the city, organized into 15 Districts. A 16th District (District 12) was disbanded in 2015. Its 4 stations were absorbed into the surrounding districts. Each District is part of one of four geographical divisions of Command. There are 4 Command areas: North, East, South and West. Each geographical division is divided into four Districts. Several Companies have been disbanded or reassigned.

The Toronto Fire Services is currently the largest municipal fire department in Canada.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bedford Park Volunteer Fire Brigade, Toronto ca. 1900.jpg|left|thumb|The Bedford Park Volunteer Fire Brigade, c. 1900. Early fire services in Toronto consisted primarily of volunteer fire companies.]]\nFire services in Toronto began in 1874 in the former City of Toronto, and still consisted of volunteer fire companies. Prior to 1874, fire services were composed of poorly trained volunteer companies in the city. The first company was created in 1826 and hook and ladder in 1831. Most were able bodied men who were trained to operate pumps to draw water from the lake. A wooden pumper truck presented to Toronto by British America Assurance Company c.1837 is now found at [[Black Creek Pioneer Village]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bukharov/5225278226|title=Fire House c.1850. Black Creek Pioneer Village. Toronto, Canada|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe city's poor fire fighting services were highlighted by the [[Great Fire of Toronto (1849)|Great Toronto Fire]] in 1849 and again in the [[Great Fire of Toronto (1904)|Great Fire of Toronto]] in 1904. After the latter fire, which destroyed much of [[Bay Street]] from The Esplanade West to Melinda Street, the Fire Department in Toronto became a critical city service and has evolved into the full-time service that exists today.\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services was created in 1998 from the merger of the former fire departments of the [[Toronto (former)|original City of Toronto]], [[East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] and [[York, Toronto|York]]. It is the largest fire department in Canada{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and the 5th largest municipal fire department in North America.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Weston Fire Department, Home Inspection Unit (19504853571).jpg|thumb|The Weston Fire Department served [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] until it was absorbed by [[York, Toronto|York]] Fire Department. The York Fire Department was itself amalgamated with other Toronto fire services in 1998.]]\nAs part of the City's 2013 Budget plans, the City of Toronto demanded a 10% cut by all city departments. TFS, under then Fire Chief James Sales, recommended vehicle reductions at several stations (Stations 213, 215, 324 and 413) and one station to close (Station 424) to meet the 10% reduction target.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/12/07/west-end-fire-station-trucks-closure216.html|title=Closures report | work=CBC News}}</ref> As well the cuts will lead to fewer firefighters on staff.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\"/>\n\nIn 2014, four pumpers (P213, P215, P413, P424) were taken out of service and Station 424 was shut down.\n\nIn 2017, under Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, the TFS Transformation Plan was developed and introduced, which included a comprehensive Inclusion Plan.

The first motorized pumper was placed in the College St station on October 18, 1911. Before that, the TFD and previous fire companies used horse drawn engines and ladders. Prior to the 1970s, the TFD had open air vehicles (driver cab not covered and mostly aerial trucks), but since then both the TFD and TFS use full covered vehicles. Prior to the 1950s, TFD used tiller-ladder trucks and since have reverted to smaller aerial units that can operate in narrow streets in Toronto.\n\nThe TFS inherited all the vehicles of the fire departments prior to amalgamation. The current strength of TFS consists of 179 vehicles. Since amalgamation, apparatus numbers are numbered by a letter and 3 digits. The first digit stands for the command that the apparatus is in (1-North, 2-East, 3-South, 4-West). The second digit stands for the district within the command that the apparatus is in. The last digit stands for the station within the district within the command that the apparatus is assigned to.\n\nA list of types of vehicles used by the TFS: (prefix letter in brackets with \"xxx\" as placeholders) is listed below:\n{{col div}}\n* [[Fire Engine#Aerial Apparatus|Aerial]] (Axxx) - most common ladders found in the city; lengths range from 75 to 105&nbsp;feet (22.86 to 32&nbsp;metres)\n* Tower (Txxx) - 2 articulated boom ladders, with 1 found in South and 1 in North Command; length 114&nbsp;feet (34.75&nbsp;metres); T331 is now a spare\n* Platform (PLxxx) - 1 ladder with attached platform, found in West Command; length 100&nbsp;feet (30.48&nbsp;metres)\n* Pumper (Pxxx)\n* Rescue (Rescue Pumper) (Rxxx) - a pumper with the addition of extrication equipment ([[Jaws of Life]]) and other tools\n* [[Fireboat]] (FBxxx) - 2 units, both stationed in Toronto Harbour\n* [[Hazardous materials apparatus|Hazardous Materials Unit]] (HAZxxx) - 1 in both North and South Commands\n* Hazmat Support Unit (HSxxx) - Unmanned equipment vehicle\n* Decontamination Unit (DExxx)\n* [[Heavy rescue vehicle|Squad]] (Sxxx) - heavy/technical rescue units, with 2 located in South Command and 1 in each of West, North, and East Commands\n* High Rise Unit (HRxxx) - 1 only, in South Command\n* Water Tanker (WTxxx) - 1 only, in East Command\n* Rapid Attack Vehicle - 1 only, on [[Toronto Islands]]\n* All-Terrain Vehicle (ATVx) - used at special events, such as the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]\n* [[Trench rescue|Trench Rescue]] Support Truck (TRSxxx) - 1 only, in East Command\n* [[Light and air unit|Air/Light Unit]] (LAxxx) - 1 in each Command (A/L 111, A/L 231, A/L 333, A/L 421)\n* District Chief (Cxx)\n* Platoon Chief (Cx0) - 1 in each Command (C10, C20, C30, C40)\n* Division Commander (Cx)\n* Deputy Chief / Fire Chief (Cx)\n* [[Fire Engine#Command Support Unit|Command]] (CMDxx) - 3 throughout the city\n* Mechanical Response Unit (MRUxxx)\n* Training Aerial (TRAx) - used by Professional Development and Training\n* Training Pumper (TRPx) - used by Professional Development and Training\n* Spare vehicles (X5xxx) - non-permanent additional vehicles added to station\n* Fire Investigator (FIx)\n{{col div end}}\n====Fire boats====\n{{Main|Fireboats of Toronto}}\nThe Toronto Fire Department and successor Toronto Fire Services has operated fire boats since 1923. Fireboat ''Charles A. Reed'' was the first fireboat operated by the service, and was a wood hull boat that entered service in 1923 and remained in use until 1964.<ref>Discover & explore Toronto's waterfront, [[Mike Filey]], pp34</ref>\n[[File:WLMK Fireboat.JPG|thumb|left|Fireboat ''[[William Lyon Mackenzie (fireboat)|William Lyon Mackenzie]]'' is one of two fireboats presently operated by the Toronto Fire Services]]\nThe service presently has two fireboats in service. Fireboat ''[[William Lyon Mackenzie (fireboat)|William Lyon Mackenzie]]'' entered service in 1964, replacing Charles A. Reed. Fireboat ''William Lyon Mackenzie'' serves as the department's main fireboat and icebreaker. In 2006, the Toronto Fire Services acquired Fireboat ''Sora'', a light utility boat built in 1982 for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]]. The Sora was retired from TFS on October 31, 2015, replaced by Fireboat ''William Thornton''. Fireboat ''William Thornton is a mid-shore patrol built in 1982 for the Canadian Coast Guard, and was acquired by the Toronto Fire Service in 2015.\n\n====Miscellaneous units====\nWhile not part of the fleet, Box 12 (Box 12 Association) and Support 7 (Greater Toronto Multiple Alarm Association) are canteen trucks run by volunteers and are present at large emergencies to provide food and beverages for Toronto firefighters.\n\nFormed in 1949, the Box 12 Association is Toronto\u2019s oldest fire canteen unit, and serves firefighters in the west end and the downtown core. The unit is named after alarm box #12, which was pulled to trigger the response to the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. This canteen has served in a number of high profile multiple alarm fires in recent history, including the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto six alarm fire in 2017. The Box 12 Association celebrated 70 years of continuous volunteer service in 2018, with Mayor John Tory in attendance. Each year, an award named after this canteen is presented by the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters Association to a fire service member for voluntarism.\n\nFormed in 1975, the GTMAA vehicle is painted with TFD scheme, but not the logo (using the GTMAA patch instead). \n\nIn addition, there are various Hazardous Materials Support trucks and a Trench Rescue Support truck that respond to specialized calls. These trucks are unmanned, and are only used by trained personnel when a specialized call is dispatched. TFS also has a fleet of various mechanical support trucks. Smaller compact cars bearing the TFS colours and logo are driven by fire prevention officers and other commanding officers.\n\nToronto Fire will also acquire use of the [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]. It was one of three purchased by the [[Toronto Police Service]] for use during the G20 summit in 2010 (1 for Marine Unit, 2 for Public Safety Unit).<ref>[http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/111923--police-will-keep-g20-sound-cannons Police Will Keep G20 Sound Cannons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126192742/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/111923--police-will-keep-g20-sound-cannons |date=2012-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nToronto Fire Services operates and manages both the Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) team and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) response team on behalf of the City of Toronto and under contract with the Province of Ontario for Provincial deployment as required as CAN-TF3.\n\nPrior to amalgamation, the Scarborough Fire Department had their fleet painted yellow. In the years following amalgamation the markings on the fire trucks were a patchwork of the various schemes used by the former boroughs. All had \"Toronto\" decaled or painted where the former borough's name used to be and the new Toronto Fire crest was added with the new numbering scheme. Over the past 19&nbsp;years - post amalgamation - the majority of the older vehicles have either been retired or repainted to match the new scheme: fire engine red with yellow reflective trim and markings.\n\n==Fire stations==\nThe Toronto Fire Services (TFS) currently operates out of 83 Fire Stations (including one open seasonally) throughout the city, organized into 15 Districts. A 16th District (District 12) was disbanded in 2015. Its 4 stations were absorbed into the surrounding districts. Each District is part of one of four geographical divisions of Command.
