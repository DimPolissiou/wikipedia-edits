A [[sea eagle]], it has two known [[subspecies]] and forms a [[Species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''). Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.\n\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight. [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.\n\nBald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white headed\". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.\n\nThe bald eagle is the [[List of national birds|national bird]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The bald eagle appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] on June 28, 2007.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.<ref name=hbw/> The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].<ref name=\"Cornell\"/> The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''H. vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Head details]]\nThe plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.<ref name=hbw/><ref name=\"ADW\"/> Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its [[nape]] and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.<ref name=\"sibley\"/> Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black,  yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak. The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America.

Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.<ref name=\"Gov\"/>\n\nThe bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=j3/><ref name=j4/> Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=\"Swenson, J. E. 1986\"/> Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water.<ref name=\"Gov\"/> Most nests have been found within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in [[Florida]].<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\nBald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIn Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove|mangrove swamps]], the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.<ref name=\"FPL\"/>\n\n[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]\nThe bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.<ref name=\"Gov\"/> However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.<ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/> Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in [[New York City]] in 2010.<ref name=r5/>\n\nWhile wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/><ref name=\"Suring\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|\u2013|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.<ref name=\"Terres\"/> Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.<ref name=r17/> Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.<ref name= Palmer/> It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.<ref name=r8/> The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.<ref name=\"ADW\"/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\n[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey.

Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.<ref name=\"Henderson\"/>\n\nAlong some portions of the [[North Pacific]] coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly [[kelp]]-dwelling fish and supplementally [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation.<ref name=\"sciencedaily\"/> Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that [[murre]]s are heading for a \"conservation collision\" due to heavy eagle predation.<ref name=\"Henderson\"/> Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as [[storm petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside.<ref name=\"Nocturnal\"/> If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle.

Like the golden eagle, bald eagles are capable of attacking jackrabbits and hares of nearly any size<ref name=\"Travsky\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/> Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially [[sheep]] (''Ovis aries''). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to {{convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.<ref name=\"ICWDM\"/> There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.<ref name=\"McEneaney\"/>\n\nSupplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas [[reptile]]s may become regular prey, especially warm areas such as [[Florida]] where reptile diversity is high. [[Turtle]]s are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> In coastal [[New Jersey]], 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles.

Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions.<ref name=\"FPL\"/><ref name=\"Gill\"/> On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it.<ref name= Cornell/><ref>Edwards, C.C. (1969). ''Winter behavior and population dynamics of American eagles in Utah''. PhD Thesis. Brigham Young University. Provo, UT.</ref><ref name=j25/> While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.<ref name=\"BNA\"/>\n\nUnlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing {{convert|1|to|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and most waterbirds preyed weighing {{convert|0.2|to|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/><ref name=\"Gill\"/><ref name=\"Newsome\"/> On the other hand, some salmon, carp and marine fish, mammals such as deer fawns and lambs and birds such as [[swan]]s taken by bald eagles are likely to have been up to at least twice the bald eagles' own size (even if the eagle was unable to fly with it).<ref name= Palmer/><ref name=\"Stalmaster\"/><ref name= Sherrod2/> They obtain much of their food as [[carrion]] or via a practice known as [[kleptoparasitism]], by which they steal prey away from other predators.

Bozeman.</ref> They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of [[whale]]s, though carcasses of [[ungulate]]s and large [[fish]] are seemingly preferred.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).<ref name=\"Sherrod\"/>\n\nWhen competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') and [[fox]]es, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, [[vulture]]s and other [[Bird of prey|raptors]].<ref name=\"Sherrod\"/> Occasionally, coyotes, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus'') and [[Dog|domestic dogs]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine.<ref name=j14/> Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed).<ref name= Watson/> However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> Wintering bald and golden eagles in [[Utah]] both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill.<ref name= Sabine>Sabine, N., & Gardner, K.

They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s and even [[otter]]s.<ref name=\"BNA\"/><ref name=j13/> They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from [[peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), prairie dogs from [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis'') and even jackrabbits from [[golden eagle]]s.<ref name=j7/><ref name=j8/> When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered [[apex predator]]s.<ref name=r6/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nBald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles [[mate for life]]. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.<ref name=\"Hinterland\"/> Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground.<ref name=\"Stalmaster\"/><ref name=r7/> Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterside habitat.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Pancamo Baytown Bald Eagles Fall 2010-1.jpg|left|thumb|Mating]]\nCompared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May.

The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledglings (more rarely three), unlike in some other \"eagle\" species such as some in the genus ''Aquila'', in which a second fledgling is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\n[[File:Back to the Six Mile Lake eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).\"feed me mom\".

The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile [[red-tailed hawk]] back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as young bald eagles are known for [[fratricide|killing their siblings]].

DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.<ref name=\"Bull87\"/> It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000\u2013500,000,<ref name=r16/> but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/support/adopt/adopt-bald-eagle|title=Adopt a Bald Eagle|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute|access-date=2018-08-04|date=2016-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/baldeagle/pastsurveys.html|title=South Carolina's Bald Eagles \u2013 Past Surveys|publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>\nOther factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62 \"American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction.\"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1930, p. 62.</ref> Later illegal shooting was described as \"the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles,\" according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.<ref name=r15/>\n\nThe species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds.<ref name=r13/> DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.<ref name=r14/>\n[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year juvenile bald eagle at [[Anacortes]], Washington United States]]\n\nWith regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000\u2013115,000 by 1992;<ref name=hbw/> the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000\u201350,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000\u201330,000 in 1992.<ref name=hbw/> Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult.

A [[sea eagle]], it has two known [[subspecies]] and forms a [[Species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''). Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.\n\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight. [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.\n\nBald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white headed\". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.\n\nThe bald eagle is the [[List of national birds|national bird]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The bald eagle appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] on June 28, 2007.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.<ref name=hbw/> The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].<ref name=\"Cornell\"/> The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''H. vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Head details]]\nThe plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.<ref name=hbw/><ref name=\"ADW\"/> Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its [[nape]] and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.<ref name=\"sibley\"/> Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black,  yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak. The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America.

Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.<ref name=\"Gov\"/>\n\nThe bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=j3/><ref name=j4/> Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=\"Swenson, J. E. 1986\"/> Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water.<ref name=\"Gov\"/> Most nests have been found within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in [[Florida]].<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\nBald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIn Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove|mangrove swamps]], the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.<ref name=\"FPL\"/>\n\n[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]\nThe bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.<ref name=\"Gov\"/> However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.<ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/> Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in [[New York City]] in 2010.<ref name=r5/>\n\nWhile wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/><ref name=\"Suring\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|\u2013|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.<ref name=\"Terres\"/> Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.<ref name=r17/> Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.<ref name= Palmer/> It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.<ref name=r8/> The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.<ref name=\"ADW\"/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\n[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey.

Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.<ref name=\"Henderson\"/>\n\nAlong some portions of the [[North Pacific]] coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly [[kelp]]-dwelling fish and supplementally [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation.<ref name=\"sciencedaily\"/> Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that [[murre]]s are heading for a \"conservation collision\" due to heavy eagle predation.<ref name=\"Henderson\"/> Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as [[storm petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside.<ref name=\"Nocturnal\"/> If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle.

Like the golden eagle, bald eagles are capable of attacking jackrabbits and hares of nearly any size<ref name=\"Travsky\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/> Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially [[sheep]] (''Ovis aries''). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to {{convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.<ref name=\"ICWDM\"/> There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.<ref name=\"McEneaney\"/>\n\nSupplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas [[reptile]]s may become regular prey, especially warm areas such as [[Florida]] where reptile diversity is high. [[Turtle]]s are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> In coastal [[New Jersey]], 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles.

Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions.<ref name=\"FPL\"/><ref name=\"Gill\"/> On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it.<ref name= Cornell/><ref>Edwards, C.C. (1969). ''Winter behavior and population dynamics of American eagles in Utah''. PhD Thesis. Brigham Young University. Provo, UT.</ref><ref name=j25/> While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.<ref name=\"BNA\"/>\n\nUnlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing {{convert|1|to|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and most waterbirds preyed weighing {{convert|0.2|to|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/><ref name=\"Gill\"/><ref name=\"Newsome\"/> On the other hand, some salmon, carp and marine fish, mammals such as deer fawns and lambs and birds such as [[swan]]s taken by bald eagles are likely to have been up to at least twice the bald eagles' own size (even if the eagle was unable to fly with it).<ref name= Palmer/><ref name=\"Stalmaster\"/><ref name= Sherrod2/> They obtain much of their food as [[carrion]] or via a practice known as [[kleptoparasitism]], by which they steal prey away from other predators.

Bozeman.</ref> They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of [[whale]]s, though carcasses of [[ungulate]]s and large [[fish]] are seemingly preferred.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).<ref name=\"Sherrod\"/>\n\nWhen competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') and [[fox]]es, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, [[vulture]]s and other [[Bird of prey|raptors]].<ref name=\"Sherrod\"/> Occasionally, coyotes, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus'') and [[Dog|domestic dogs]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine.<ref name=j14/> Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed).<ref name= Watson/> However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved.<ref name=\"BNA\"/> Wintering bald and golden eagles in [[Utah]] both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill.<ref name= Sabine>Sabine, N., & Gardner, K.

They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s and even [[otter]]s.<ref name=\"BNA\"/><ref name=j13/> They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from [[peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), prairie dogs from [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis'') and even jackrabbits from [[golden eagle]]s.<ref name=j7/><ref name=j8/> When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered [[apex predator]]s.<ref name=r6/>\n\n==Reproduction==\nBald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles [[mate for life]]. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.<ref name=\"Hinterland\"/> Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground.<ref name=\"Stalmaster\"/><ref name=r7/> Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterside habitat.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Pancamo Baytown Bald Eagles Fall 2010-1.jpg|left|thumb|Mating]]\nCompared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May.

The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledglings (more rarely three), unlike in some other \"eagle\" species such as some in the genus ''Aquila'', in which a second fledgling is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\n[[File:Back to the Six Mile Lake eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).\"feed me mom\".

The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile [[red-tailed hawk]] back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as young bald eagles are known for [[fratricide|killing their siblings]].

DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.<ref name=\"Bull87\"/> It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000\u2013500,000,<ref name=r16/> but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/support/adopt/adopt-bald-eagle|title=Adopt a Bald Eagle|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute|access-date=2018-08-04|date=2016-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/baldeagle/pastsurveys.html|title=South Carolina's Bald Eagles \u2013 Past Surveys|publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>\nOther factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62 \"American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction.\"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1930, p. 62.</ref> Later illegal shooting was described as \"the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles,\" according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.<ref name=r15/>\n\nThe species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds.<ref name=r13/> DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.<ref name=r14/>\n[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year juvenile bald eagle at [[Anacortes]], Washington United States]]\n\nWith regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000\u2013115,000 by 1992;<ref name=hbw/> the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000\u201350,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000\u201330,000 in 1992.<ref name=hbw/> Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult.

In the [[Puranas]], Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God [[Vishnu]] from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as '''Ananta Shesha''', which translates as endless-Shesha or '''Adishesha''' \"first Shesha\". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist. \n\nVishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha. Shesha is considered a servant and a manifestation of Vishnu. He is said to have descended to Earth in three human forms or avatars: [[Lakshmana]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Rama]] during Tretayuga, and as [[Balarama]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Krishna]] during Dwaparayuga and Ramanujacharya, the proponent of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedanta during Kaliyuga.\n\n\"Shesha\" in Sanskrit texts, especially those relating to mathematical calculation, implies the \"remainder\"\u2014that which remains when all else ceases to exist.\n\n==Form==\n[[File:Sheshashayi - Laxminarayan by DHURANDHAR MV.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Vishnu]] resting on Ananta-Shesha, with his consort [[Lakshmi]] massaging his feet]]\n[[File:Vishnu reclining on Shesha, as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.).jpg|right|thumb|Vishnu reclining on Shesha,as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.)]]\n\nShesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled in space, or on the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of bliss]], to form the bed on which Vishnu lies. Sometimes he is shown as five-headed or seven-headed, but more commonly as a many thousand-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.\n\nHis name means \"that which remains\", from the [[Sanskrit]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''\u015bi\u1e63'', because when the world is destroyed at the end of the [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]], Shesha remains as he is.\n\nIn the [[Bhagavadgita]] of Chapter 10, verse 29, Shri [[Krishna]] while describing 75 of his common manifestations, declares, {{IAST|\"ananta\u015b ca asmi n\u0101g\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\"}}: Of the nagas, I am Ananta.\n\nAs per the [[Mahabharata]], Shesha was born to sage [[Kashyap]] and his wife [[Kadru]]. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Airavata]] and [[Takshaka]] were born, in order. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Garuda, who was Kashyapa's son through Vinatha, sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinatha were daughters of Daksha).\n\nShesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara and Himalayas. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. [[Brahma]], convinced of his Shesha's will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. [[Brahma]] then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the unstable earth and stabilize it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilized her with his hood. He is known to support her even today, thus making Patala his perennial residence.<ref>''Mbh'', Adi Parva</ref>\n\n===Maha Vishnu and Sankarshana===\n\nShesha is also depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of Maha Vishnu. Since he is known as Adishesha (the foremost of snakes) and because he is Anantashesha or simply [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] (endless, as He is known to remain in existence even after the end of the Kalpa, when the whole universe is destroyed).\n\nIn the [[Bhagavata Purana]] Shesha is named '''Sankarshana''', the [[tamasic]] energy of Lord [[Narayana]] himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of [[patala]], where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where Sankarshana is the ruler. He is said to live since before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates 11 [[Rudras]] from Them to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.\n\nSankarshana is also one of the four [[vyuha]] forms of Vishnu or [[Krishna]], the other three being [[V\u0101sudeva]], [[Pradyumna]] and [[Aniruddha]].\n\nSankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create [[Brahma]]. In other words, Lord Sankarshana is Lord Narayana himself.\n\nIn previous chapters of the [[Purana]] it is also said that Lord Sankarshana spoke the Bhagavata to the [[Four Kumaras]], who in their turn passed this message of the Bhagavata.

In the [[Puranas]], Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God [[Vishnu]] from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as '''Ananta Shesha''', which translates as endless-Shesha or '''Adishesha''' \"first Shesha\". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist. \n\nVishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha. Shesha is considered a servant and a manifestation of Vishnu. He is said to have descended to Earth in three human forms or avatars: [[Lakshmana]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Rama]] during Tretayuga, and as [[Balarama]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Krishna]] during Dwaparayuga and Ramanujacharya, the proponent of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedanta during Kaliyuga.\n\n\"Shesha\" in Sanskrit texts, especially those relating to mathematical calculation, implies the \"remainder\"\u2014that which remains when all else ceases to exist.\n\n==Form==\n[[File:Sheshashayi - Laxminarayan by DHURANDHAR MV.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Vishnu]] resting on Ananta-Shesha, with his consort [[Lakshmi]] massaging his feet]]\n[[File:Vishnu reclining on Shesha, as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.).jpg|right|thumb|Vishnu reclining on Shesha,as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.)]]\n\nShesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled in space, or on the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of bliss]], to form the bed on which Vishnu lies. Sometimes he is shown as five-headed or seven-headed, but more commonly as a many thousand-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.\n\nHis name means \"that which remains\", from the [[Sanskrit]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''\u015bi\u1e63'', because when the world is destroyed at the end of the [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]], Shesha remains as he is.\n\nIn the [[Bhagavadgita]] of Chapter 10, verse 29, Shri [[Krishna]] while describing 75 of his common manifestations, declares, {{IAST|\"ananta\u015b ca asmi n\u0101g\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\"}}: Of the nagas, I am Ananta.\n\nAs per the [[Mahabharata]], Shesha was born to sage [[Kashyap]] and his wife [[Kadru]]. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Airavata]] and [[Takshaka]] were born, in order. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Garuda, who was Kashyapa's son through Vinatha, sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinatha were daughters of Daksha).\n\nShesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara and Himalayas. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. [[Brahma]], convinced of his Shesha's will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. [[Brahma]] then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the unstable earth and stabilize it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilized her with his hood. He is known to support her even today, thus making Patala his perennial residence.<ref>''Mbh'', Adi Parva</ref>\n\n===Maha Vishnu and Sankarshana===\n\nShesha is also depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of Maha Vishnu. Since he is known as Adishesha (the foremost of snakes) and because he is Anantashesha or simply [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] (endless, as He is known to remain in existence even after the end of the Kalpa, when the whole universe is destroyed).\n\nIn the [[Bhagavata Purana]] Shesha is named '''Sankarshana''', the [[tamasic]] energy of Lord [[Narayana]] himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of [[patala]], where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where Sankarshana is the ruler. He is said to live since before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates 11 [[Rudras]] from Them to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.\n\nSankarshana is also one of the four [[vyuha]] forms of Vishnu or [[Krishna]], the other three being [[V\u0101sudeva]], [[Pradyumna]] and [[Aniruddha]].\n\nSankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create [[Brahma]]. In other words, Lord Sankarshana is Lord Narayana himself.\n\nIn previous chapters of the [[Purana]] it is also said that Lord Sankarshana spoke the Bhagavata to the [[Four Kumaras]], who in their turn passed this message of the Bhagavata. At some point the message was passed to sage [[Maitreya]] who in his turn spoke it to [[Vidura]].\n\n==Other details==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Seshanarayana (Oleographic print).jpg|thumb|250px|Sheshanarayana by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]\n\n[[Lakshmana]] and [[Balarama]] are considered avatara of Sheshanaga (or vice versa).\n\nIt is considered in Vaishnavism, that Lord Balarama is the first manifestation from Lord Krishna, and that Lord Balarama then incarnates into Sesha to serve Krishna as Vishnu.\n\nIn a story from the [[Purana]]s, Shesha's younger brother [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] loosens [[Mount Mandara]], to enable it to be used in the churning of the ocean by the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and [[asura]]s.\n\nAccording to the [[Mahabharata]] (Adi Parva), his father was [[Kashyapa]] and his mother [[Kadru]].\n\nThe city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is named after him as the \"City of Lord Anantapadmanabha.\"\n\n==Quotations==\n[[File:Vishnu with Shesha Naga - Bronze - Showcase 11-1 - Bronze Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6635.JPG|thumb|Vishnu with Shesha Naga-ancient Bronze artefact in Government Museum Mathura]]\n* \"The foremost manifestation of Lord Vishnu is Sankar\u1e63ana, who is known as Ananta.
