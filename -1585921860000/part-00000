They must present to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, a UN body, geological evidence that their shelf effectively extends beyond the 200 nautical miles limit. The Commission does not define borders but merely judges the scientific validity of assertions and it is up to countries with rightful but overlapping claims to come to a settlement. On this basis, four of the five states fronting the Arctic Ocean&nbsp;\u2013 Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the Russian Federation&nbsp;\u2013 must have made any desired claims by 2013, 2014, 2006, and 2007 respectively.

Valid extended continental shelf claims do not and cannot extend a state's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) since the EEZ is determined solely by drawing a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} line using territorial sea baselines as their starting point. Press reports often confuse the facts and assert that extended continental shelf claims expand a state's EEZ thereby giving a state exclusive rights to resources not only on the sea bottom or below it, but also to those in the water column above it. The Arctic chart prepared by Durham University explicitly illustrates the extent of the uncontested Exclusive Economic Zones of the five states bordering the Arctic Ocean, and also the relatively small expanse of remaining \"high seas\" or totally international waters at the very North of the planet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/06_08_08_arcticboundaries.pdf|title=Maritime jurisdiction and boundaries in the Arctic region|date=2008-07-24|publisher=International Boundaries Research Unit, [[Durham University]]}}</ref>\n\n====Specific nations====\n\n=====Canada=====\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| image1 = [https://www.acls-aatc.ca/files/english/books/6.10.jpg Map identifying baselines and territorial sea] in the [[Canadian Arctic islands]];<ref>{{Cite canlaw|regtitle  =Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order|type=reg|regnumber = SOR/85-872|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-85-872/FullText.html}}</ref> retrieved {{date|2017-03-25}}\n}}\nCanada ratified UNCLOS on 7 November 2003 and had through 2013 to file its claim to an extended continental shelf. {{As of|2013|12}}, Canada had announced that it would file a claim which includes the [[North Pole]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/canada-north-pole-claim|title=Canada to claim north pole as its own|date=December 9, 2013|work=Associated Press in Toronto|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref> Canada planned to submit their claim to a portion of the Arctic continental shelf in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/05/03/canada-to-submit-its-arctic-continental-shelf-claim-in-2018/|title=Canada to submit its Arctic continental shelf claim in 2018|last=International|first=Radio Canada|date=3 May 2016|website=www.rcinet.ca|language=en-US|access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the Russian [[Arktika 2007]] expedition, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister]], [[Peter MacKay]], said \"[t]his is posturing.

The small uninhabited island, sized {{convert|1.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}, was named for Greenlandic Arctic traveller [[Hans Hendrik]].\n\nIn 1973, Canada and Denmark negotiated the geographic coordinates of the continental shelf, and settled on a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] treaty that was ratified by the [[United Nations]] on December 17, 1973, and has been in force since March 13, 1974. The treaty lists 127 points (by [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) from [[Davis Strait]] to the end of [[Robeson Channel]], where Nares Strait runs into [[Lincoln Sea]]; the border is defined by [[geodesic]] lines between these points. The treaty does not, however, draw a line from point 122 ({{coord|80|49|2|N|66|29|0|W}}) to point 123 ({{coord|80|49|8|N|66|26|3|W}})\u2014a distance of {{convert|875|m|mi|abbr=on|2}}.

In July 2005, former [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Canadian defence minister]] [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]] made an unannounced stop on Hans Island during a trip to the Arctic; this launched yet another diplomatic quarrel between the governments, and a truce was called that September.\n\nCanada had claimed Hans Island was clearly in its territory, as topographic maps originally used in 1967 to determine the island's coordinates clearly showed the entire island on Canada's side of the delimitation line. However, federal officials reviewed the latest satellite imagery in July 2007, and conceded that the line went roughly through the middle of the island.

They must present to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, a UN body, geological evidence that their shelf effectively extends beyond the 200 nautical miles limit. The Commission does not define borders but merely judges the scientific validity of assertions and it is up to countries with rightful but overlapping claims to come to a settlement. On this basis, four of the five states fronting the Arctic Ocean&nbsp;\u2013 Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the Russian Federation&nbsp;\u2013 must have made any desired claims by 2013, 2014, 2006, and 2007 respectively.

Valid extended continental shelf claims do not and cannot extend a state's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) since the EEZ is determined solely by drawing a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} line using territorial sea baselines as their starting point. Press reports often confuse the facts and assert that extended continental shelf claims expand a state's EEZ thereby giving a state exclusive rights to resources not only on the sea bottom or below it, but also to those in the water column above it. The Arctic chart prepared by Durham University explicitly illustrates the extent of the uncontested Exclusive Economic Zones of the five states bordering the Arctic Ocean, and also the relatively small expanse of remaining \"high seas\" or totally international waters at the very North of the planet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/06_08_08_arcticboundaries.pdf|title=Maritime jurisdiction and boundaries in the Arctic region|date=2008-07-24|publisher=International Boundaries Research Unit, [[Durham University]]}}</ref>\n\n====Specific nations====\n\n=====Canada=====\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| image1 = [https://www.acls-aatc.ca/files/english/books/6.10.jpg Map identifying baselines and territorial sea] in the [[Canadian Arctic islands]];<ref>{{Cite canlaw|regtitle  =Territorial Sea Geographical Coordinates (Area 7) Order|type=reg|regnumber = SOR/85-872|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-85-872/FullText.html}}</ref> retrieved {{date|2017-03-25}}\n}}\nCanada ratified UNCLOS on 7 November 2003 and had through 2013 to file its claim to an extended continental shelf. {{As of|2013|12}}, Canada had announced that it would file a claim which includes the [[North Pole]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/canada-north-pole-claim|title=Canada to claim north pole as its own|date=December 9, 2013|work=Associated Press in Toronto|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref> Canada planned to submit their claim to a portion of the Arctic continental shelf in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/05/03/canada-to-submit-its-arctic-continental-shelf-claim-in-2018/|title=Canada to submit its Arctic continental shelf claim in 2018|last=International|first=Radio Canada|date=3 May 2016|website=www.rcinet.ca|language=en-US|access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the Russian [[Arktika 2007]] expedition, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister]], [[Peter MacKay]], said \"[t]his is posturing.

The small uninhabited island, sized {{convert|1.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}, was named for Greenlandic Arctic traveller [[Hans Hendrik]].\n\nIn 1973, Canada and Denmark negotiated the geographic coordinates of the continental shelf, and settled on a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] treaty that was ratified by the [[United Nations]] on December 17, 1973, and has been in force since March 13, 1974. The treaty lists 127 points (by [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) from [[Davis Strait]] to the end of [[Robeson Channel]], where Nares Strait runs into [[Lincoln Sea]]; the border is defined by [[geodesic]] lines between these points. The treaty does not, however, draw a line from point 122 ({{coord|80|49|2|N|66|29|0|W}}) to point 123 ({{coord|80|49|8|N|66|26|3|W}})\u2014a distance of {{convert|875|m|mi|abbr=on|2}}.
