There is also a Lemmy Kilmister signature version (4004LK) of the instrument.\n\n==Construction==\nThe iconic upper bout and headstock silhouettes of the Rickenbacker 4001 are the most salient characteristics of the \"crested-wave\" body shape designed by luthier [[Roger Rossmeisl]] for Rickenbacker's model 4000. The 4001 model features a [[neck-through]] construction, a full-wood body, [[fretboard]] with metal strings (originally flat-wound, though many players replaced them with round-wounds), twin truss rods, triangle inlays, two pickups, two volume and two tone dials, selector switch,<ref name=\"vintage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/ric4001.php |title=Vintage Guitar \u2013 Rickenbacker 4001 Bass Guitar |publisher=Vintageguitars.org.uk |accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref> and wiring for Rick-O-Sound (standard after 1971).<ref name=rickbeat>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickbeat.com/modelslibrary/4001/4001.htm |title=Rickenbacker 4001 |publisher=Rickbeat.com |accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref> Rickenbacker also produced six-string and 12 string guitars and a short-scale bass, the 3000 model.<ref name=\"vintage\"/> The bridge system is a relatively unusual design, both in aesthetics and in function, featuring removable saddles, as well as a compartment designed to hold a foam mute.\n\nThe 4001S (and 1999) model varies in its use of dot inlays, and unbound neck construction.<ref name=\"vintage\"/> The Rickenbacker 4003, which replaced the 4001, differs in the truss rod design and introduces a fret wire that better withstands the wear from round-wound strings. Fast fret wear was a common complaint for many years, and Rickenbacker sought to address the issue. The pickups are also higher in output, and the bridge pickup, a so-called \"horseshoe\" pickup, was entirely remodelled, featuring a more conventional design, although the \"horseshoe\" is still part of the construction, albeit removable. More recent 4003 models also feature a push-pull switch on one of the tone knobs, which diminishes the output of the pickups, to more closely resemble the original 4001 tone. Other features remained similar to its forebear.\n\nRickenbacker has in recent years also produced a five-string model, featuring a more conventional bridge system, smaller Schaller machine heads and distinctive, asymmetrical pickups. It retains the Rickenbacker's signature 33\" scale length, an unusual design for a five-string instrument. Between the years 1993 and 2018 Rickenbacker also manafactured a streamlined model, named the 4004, which used the 4001's trademark shape, but featured smaller pickups, a simplified control layout, a more conventional bridge system and eschewed the use of aesthetic details such as binding or a [[pickguard]].\n\n==Notable players== \n*[[Geddy Lee]]<ref>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/29906785009672688/</ref> of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]\n*[[Cliff Burton]]<ref>{{cite  book|last1=McIver|first1=Joel|last2=Hammett|first2=Kirk|authorlink2=Kirk Hammett|title=To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9uBIwlYSokC&pg=PA265|year=2009|publisher=Jawbone|isbn=978-1-906002-24-4|page=265}}</ref> of [[Metallica]]\n*[[Lemmy Kilmister]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/2931/lemmy-kilmister/|title=Lemmy Kilmister|author=Willie G.

There is also a Lemmy Kilmister signature version (4004LK) of the instrument.\n\n==Construction==\nThe iconic upper bout and headstock silhouettes of the Rickenbacker 4001 are the most salient characteristics of the \"crested-wave\" body shape designed by luthier [[Roger Rossmeisl]] for Rickenbacker's model 4000. The 4001 model features a [[neck-through]] construction, a full-wood body, [[fretboard]] with metal strings (originally flat-wound, though many players replaced them with round-wounds), twin truss rods, triangle inlays, two pickups, two volume and two tone dials, selector switch,<ref name=\"vintage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/ric4001.php |title=Vintage Guitar \u2013 Rickenbacker 4001 Bass Guitar |publisher=Vintageguitars.org.uk |accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref> and wiring for Rick-O-Sound (standard after 1971).<ref name=rickbeat>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickbeat.com/modelslibrary/4001/4001.htm |title=Rickenbacker 4001 |publisher=Rickbeat.com |accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref> Rickenbacker also produced six-string and 12 string guitars and a short-scale bass, the 3000 model.<ref name=\"vintage\"/> The bridge system is a relatively unusual design, both in aesthetics and in function, featuring removable saddles, as well as a compartment designed to hold a foam mute.\n\nThe 4001S (and 1999) model varies in its use of dot inlays, and unbound neck construction.<ref name=\"vintage\"/> The Rickenbacker 4003, which replaced the 4001, differs in the truss rod design and introduces a fret wire that better withstands the wear from round-wound strings. Fast fret wear was a common complaint for many years, and Rickenbacker sought to address the issue. The pickups are also higher in output, and the bridge pickup, a so-called \"horseshoe\" pickup, was entirely remodelled, featuring a more conventional design, although the \"horseshoe\" is still part of the construction, albeit removable. More recent 4003 models also feature a push-pull switch on one of the tone knobs, which diminishes the output of the pickups, to more closely resemble the original 4001 tone. Other features remained similar to its forebear.\n\nRickenbacker has in recent years also produced a five-string model, featuring a more conventional bridge system, smaller Schaller machine heads and distinctive, asymmetrical pickups. It retains the Rickenbacker's signature 33\" scale length, an unusual design for a five-string instrument. Between the years 1993 and 2018 Rickenbacker also manafactured a streamlined model, named the 4004, which used the 4001's trademark shape, but featured smaller pickups, a simplified control layout, a more conventional bridge system and eschewed the use of aesthetic details such as binding or a [[pickguard]].\n\n==Notable players== \n*[[Geddy Lee]]<ref>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/29906785009672688/</ref> of [[RUSH]]\n*[[Cliff Burton]]<ref>{{cite  book|last1=McIver|first1=Joel|last2=Hammett|first2=Kirk|authorlink2=Kirk Hammett|title=To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9uBIwlYSokC&pg=PA265|year=2009|publisher=Jawbone|isbn=978-1-906002-24-4|page=265}}</ref> of [[Metallica]]\n*[[Lemmy Kilmister]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/2931/lemmy-kilmister/|title=Lemmy Kilmister|author=Willie G.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

Snow scenes were shot in the Union Ice Company ice house in downtown L.A.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref>IMDB [http://imdb.com/title/tt0035015/locations Filming Locations for The Magnificent Ambersons]</ref> The film was budgeted at $853,950 but this went over during the shoot and ultimately exceeded $1 million.<ref name=\"richard\">{{cite book|first=Richard B.|last=Jewell|title=RKO Radio Pictures: A Titan is Born|publisher=University of California|location=Sacramento, California|date=2012|ISBN= 978-0520271791|pages=239\u2013240}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1973 interview with [[Dick Cavett]], Moorehead recalled the arduous work involved before filming her climactic scene where she sinks against the unheated boiler.  In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself, \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...[H]e had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare.

And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

She was the eldest daughter of King [[Baldwin&nbsp;II of Jerusalem]], and the [[Armenia]]n princess [[Morphia of Melitene]].\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[Jerusalem]] had recently been conquered by [[Christians|Christian]] [[Franks]] in 1099 during the [[First Crusade]], and Melisende's paternal family originally came from the County of [[Rethel]] in France. Her father Baldwin was a crusader knight who carved out the Crusader State of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] and married Morphia, daughter of the Armenian prince [[Gabriel of Melitene]], in a diplomatic marriage to fortify alliances in the region.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\">Hamilton, Bernard, ''Queens of Jerusalem'', Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978, ''Frankish women in the Outremer'', pg 143, ''Melisende's youth'' pgs 147, 148, ''Recognized as successor'' pg 148, 149, ''Offers patronage and issues diplomas, Marriage with Fulk, Birth of {{nowrap|Baldwin III,}} Second Crowing with father, husband, and son,'' pg 149,</ref><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\">Oldenbourg, Zoe, ''The Crusades'', Pantheon Books, 1966, ''{{nowrap|Baldwin II}} searches for a husband for Melisende'', ''feudal relationship between France and Jerusalem'', ''{{nowrap|Fulk V}} of Anjou'', pg 264,</ref>  Melisende, named after her paternal grandmother, Melisende of [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], grew up in Edessa until she was 13, when her father was elected as the [[King of Jerusalem]] as successor of his cousin [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin&nbsp;I]]. By the time of his election as king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} and Morphia already had three daughters:<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Melisende, [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], and [[Hodierna of Tripoli|Hodierna]].  As the new king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had been encouraged to put away Morphia in favor of a new younger wife with better political connections, one that could yet bear him a male heir. Armenian historian [[Matthew of Edessa]] wrote that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was thoroughly devoted to his wife,<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> and refused to consider divorcing her.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> As a mark of his love for his wife, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had postponed his [[coronation]] until [[Christmas Day]] 1119 so that Morphia and his daughters could travel to Jerusalem and so that the queen could be crowned alongside him.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> For her part, Morphia did not interfere in the day to day politics of Jerusalem, but demonstrated her ability to take charge of affairs when events warranted it.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> When Melisende's father was captured during a campaign in 1123, Morphia hired a band of Armenian mercenaries to discover where her husband was being held prisoner,<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> and in 1124 Morphia took a leading part in the negotiations with Baldwin's captors to have him released, including traveling to Syria and handing over her youngest daughter Yveta as hostage and as surety for the payment of the king's ransom.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Both of her parents stood as role models for the young Melisende, half [[Franks|Frankish]] and half Armenian, growing up in the [[Crusader states|Frankish East]] in a state of constant warfare.\n\nAs the eldest child, Melisende was raised as [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/> Frankish women in the [[Outremer]] had a higher [[life expectancy]] than men, in part due to the constant state of war in the region, and as a result Frankish women exerted a wide degree of influence in the region and provided a strong sense of continuity to Eastern Frankish society.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Women who inherited territory usually did so because war and violence brought many men to premature death, and women who were recognized as [[queen regnant]] rarely exercised their authority directly, with their spouse exercising authority ''[[jure uxoris]]'', through the medium of their wives.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Contemporaries of Melisende who did rule, however, included [[Urraca of Castile]] (1080\u20131129), and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] (1122\u20131204). During her father's reign Melisende was styled  as ''daughter of the king and heir of the kingdom of Jerusalem'', and took precedence above other nobles and Christian clergy in ceremonial occasions.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>''''filia regis et regni Jerosolimitani haeres''</ref> Increasingly she was associated with her father on official documents, including in the minting of money, granting of fiefdoms and other forms of patronage, and in diplomatic correspondence.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Baldwin raised his daughter as a capable successor to himself and Melisende enjoyed the support of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'', a kind of royal council composed of the nobility and clergy of the realm.\n\nHowever, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} also thought that he would have to marry Melisende to a powerful ally, one who would protect and safeguard Melisende's inheritance and her future heirs. Baldwin deferred to King [[Louis&nbsp;VI of France]] to recommend a Frankish [[vassal]] for his daughter's hand.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/><ref>{{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} embassy to France was headed by his constable, [[William I of Bures]] and with [[Hugues de Payens]].</ref> The Frankish connection remained an important consideration for Crusader Jerusalem, as the nascent kingdom depended heavily on manpower and connections from France, Germany, and Italy. By deferring to France, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was not submitting Jerusalem to the [[suzerainty]] of France; rather, he was placing the moral guardianship of the Outremer with the West for its survival, reminding {{nowrap|Louis VI}} that the Outremer was, to some extent, Frankish lands.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/>\n\n{{nowrap|Louis VI}} chose [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk&nbsp;V, Count of Anjou and Main]], a renownedly rich crusader and military commander, and to some extent a growing threat to {{nowrap|Louis VI}} himself.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Fulk's son from a previous marriage, [[Geoffrey of Anjou|Geoffrey]],  was married to [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry&nbsp;I of England]]'s designated heir as England's next [[queen regnant]]. {{nowrap|Fulk V}} could be a potential grandfather to a future ruler of England, a relationship that would outflank {{nowrap|Louis VI}}. Fulk's wealth, connections, and influence made him as powerful as the King of France, according to historian Zoe Oldenbourg.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/> Throughout the negotiations Fulk insisted on being sole ruler of Jerusalem. Hesitant, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} initially acquiesced to these demands though he would come to reconsider.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>Historian [[Hans E. Mayer]] argued that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had promised sole rulership of Jerusalem after his death to Fulk, however historian Bernard Hamilton points out that there is no evidence to support Mayer's conclusion that Baldwin ever intended to prevent Melisende from ruling, rather the opposite, that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} purposefully associated Melisende, and then Fulk, with his rule up until the time of his death. ''Medieval Women; Queens of Jerusalem, page 151''</ref> {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} perceived that Fulk, an ambitious man with grown sons to spare, was also a threat to {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} family and interest, and specifically a threat to his daughter Melisende. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} suspected that once he had died, Fulk would repudiate Melisende, set her and her children aside in favor of Elias, Fulk's younger but full grown son from his first marriage as an heir to Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/>\n\nWhen Melisende bore a son and heir in 1130, the future [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin&nbsp;III]], her father took steps to ensure Melisende would rule after him as reigning Queen of Jerusalem. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} held a coronation ceremony investing the kingship of Jerusalem jointly between his daughter, his grandson {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, and Fulk. Strengthening her position, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} designated Melisende as sole guardian for the young Baldwin, excluding Fulk. When {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} died the next year in 1131, Melisende and Fulk ascended to the throne as joint rulers. Later, [[William of Tyre]] wrote of Melisende's right to rule following the death of her father that ''the rule of the kingdom remained in the power of the lady queen Melisende, a queen beloved by God, to whom it passed by hereditary right''.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>''reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat''</ref> However, with the aid of his knights, Fulk excluded Melisende from granting titles, offering patronage, and of issuing grants, diplomas, and charters. Fulk openly and publicly dismissed her hereditary authority. The fears of {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} seemed to be justified, and the continued mistreatment of their queen irritated the members of the ''Haute Cour'', whose own positions would be eroded if Fulk continued to dominate the realm. Fulk's behavior was in keeping with his ruling philosophy, as in Anjou Fulk had squashed any attempts by local towns to administer themselves and strong-armed his vassals into submission.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/><ref>Oldenbourg wrote that Fulk had \"broken the resistance of his principal vassals on his own domains and paralyzed all attempts at emancipation by the townspeople. Page 264</ref> Fulk's autocratic style contrasted with the somewhat collegial association with their monarch that native Eastern Franks had come to enjoy.\n\n==Palace intrigue==\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states, with Muslim states (in shades of green) in 1135 during the reign of Melisende]]\n[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f12v.jpg|frame|An illustration from the [[Melisende Psalter]], commissioned during the Queen's reign]]\nThe estrangement between husband and wife was a convenient political tool that Fulk used in 1134 when he accused [[Hugh&nbsp;II of Le Puiset]], [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa]], of having an affair with Melisende. Hugh was the most powerful baron in the kingdom, and devotedly loyal to the memory of his cousin {{nowrap|Baldwin II}}. This loyalty now extended to Melisende. Contemporary sources, such as [[William of Tyre]], discount the alleged infidelity of Melisende and instead point out that Fulk overly favoured newly arrived Frankish crusaders from Anjou over the native nobility of the kingdom. Had Melisende been guilty, the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Church]] and nobility likely would not have later rallied to her cause.\n\nHugh allied himself with the Muslim city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], and was able to hold off the army set against him. He could not maintain his position indefinitely, however. His alliance with Ascalon cost him support at court. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] negotiated lenient terms for peace, and Hugh was exiled for three years. Soon thereafter an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Hugh was attributed to Fulk or his supporters. This was reason enough for the queen's party to openly challenge Fulk, as Fulk's unfounded assertions of infidelity were a public affront that would damage Melisende's position entirely.\n\nThrough what amounted to a palace coup, the queen's supporters overcame Fulk, and from 1135 onwards Fulk's influence rapidly deteriorated. One historian wrote that Fulk's supporters \"went in terror of their lives\" in the palace. William of Tyre wrote that Fulk \"did not attempt to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without [Melisende's] knowledge\". Husband and wife reconciled by 1136 and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], was born. When Fulk was killed in a hunting accident in 1143, Melisende publicly and privately mourned for him.\n\nMelisende's victory was complete. Again she is seen in the historical record granting titles of nobility, fiefdoms, appointments and offices, granting royal favours and pardons and holding court. Of Melisende, William of Tyre wrote \"reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat.\" Melisende was no mere regent-queen for her son {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, but a queen regnant, reigning by right of hereditary and civil law.\n\n==Patroness of the church and arts==\n\nMelisende enjoyed the support of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] throughout her lifetime; from her appointment as {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} successor, throughout the conflict with Fulk, and later when {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} would come of age. In 1138 she founded the large convent of [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)#Roman Catholic Church of St. Lazarus|St. Lazarus]] in Bethany where her younger sister [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]] would rule as abbess. In keeping with a royal abbey, Melisende granted the convent the fertile plains of [[Jericho]]. Additionally, the queen supplied rich furnishings and liturgical vessels, so that it would not be in any way inferior to religious houses for men. According to author and historian [[Bernard Hamilton]], Melisende also gave large\n\n:\"endowments to the Holy Sepulchre, our Lady of Josaphat, the [[Templum Domini]], the Catholic Order of the Hospital (Knights of Malta), the leper hospital of Saint Lazarus, and the Praemonstratensians of Saint Samuel's.\"\n\nQueen Melisende also appreciated a variety of literary and visual arts - her passion and assortment due to the different artistic exposures she received as a result of her parents' mixed Frankish-Armenian union. She created both a school of book makers and a school of miniature painters - a painting style most used in medieval illuminated manuscripts.<ref name=\"Vintage Books\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=72}}</ref> She also commissioned the construction of \"a vaulted complex of shops in Jerusalem, including the legendary (and still surviving) Street of Bad Cooking\".<ref name=\"Vintage Books\"/> The Street of Bad Cooking (Malquisinat) was the central and most famous market of Crusader Jerusalem, presenting specialized merchants and cooks to supply the numerous pilgrims who visited the city with food.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Food|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eating-in-historical-jerusalem|website=The Jewish Mosaic|publisher=Hebrew School of Jerusalem|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref>\n\nMelisende's love for books and her religious piety were very well known. She was recognized as a patroness of books,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=70}}</ref> a fact her husband knew how to exploit following the incident that greatly injured their relationship and the monarchy's stability. King Fulk was jealous of the friendship Melisende shared with Hugh, Count of Jafa.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=152}}</ref> Placed under scrutiny for supposed adultery with the Queen, Hugh was attacked by an assassin who was most likely sent by the King himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=155}}</ref> This greatly angered the queen. Melisende was extremely hostile after the accusations about her alleged infidelity with Hugh and refused to speak to or allow in court those who sided with her husband - deeming them \"under the displeasure of the queen\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=156}}</ref> It is apparent that Fulk set to appease his wife by commissioning her the special book as a peace offering. \"The Melisende Psalter is an extraordinarily beautiful little book that survives today in the British Museum\" - a gloriously decorated gift carefully and thoughtfully chosen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While only 21.6 centimeters tall and 14 centimeters wide, the [[Melisende Psalter]] was ornately and expensively adorned - originally having the entire front cover gilded in gold and with six roundels made of ivory and exquisitely carved.<ref name=\"Melisende\">{{cite book|last1=Tranovich|first1=Margaret|title=Melisende of Jerusalem: the World of a Forgotten Crusader Queen|date=2011|publisher=Melisende|pages=23}}</ref> It has a \"multicolored silk spine\" and the ivory roundels/medallions have studded \"turquoise, ruby, and emerald stones\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> around scenes of King David from the Old Testament, a calendar with all the saints' days/observances marked, and also prayers of worship and adoration - all with extremely ornate illuminated initial letters.<ref name=\"Melisende\"/> The fact that it is written in Latin suggests that Melisende was literate in Latin. An important fact which shows that it was acceptable for noble women in the Middle East to be educated in this way. \nWhile there is no identification placing this book as Melisende's or made with her in mind, there is plenty of evidence that is highly suggestive of her as the sole recipient. The use of Latin text appropriate for a secular woman (as opposed to an abbess or such), the particular venerations of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalen (suggestive of the nearby abbey Melisende patronized and was later buried at), and the only two royal mentions/inclusions being of Melisende's parents all indicate that this book was for her.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> One final indicator that this was from Fulk to Melisende (other than the fact that only a king would be able to afford creating such a piece so pricey) is that there is a carving of a bird on the back cover labeled \"Herodius\" which is also known as \"fulica\" or falcon - making this a stamp pun/play on words to King Fulk's name.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=71}}</ref>\n\nThough influenced by Byzantine and Italian traditions in the illuminations, the artists who contributed to the Melisende Psalter had a unique and decidedly 'Jerusalem style'. The historian [[Hugo Buchtal]] wrote that\n\n:\"Jerusalem during the second quarter of the twelfth century possessed a flourishing and well-established scriptorium which could, without difficulty, undertake a commission for a royal manuscript ''de grand luxe''\".\n\nThere is no account of how Melisende received this gift but shortly after its creation, the royal union appeared stronger than ever. Two things prove the couple's reconciliation: 1) almost every single charter after this was issued by Fulk but labeled \"with the consent and the approval of Queen Melisende\", and 2) the birth of the royal pair's second son, Amalric, in 1136.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> It is also reported that Queen Melisende mourned greatly after her husband fell off a horse and died in 1143.<ref name=\"Vintage Books\"/>\n\n==Second Crusade==\nIn 1144 the [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was besieged in a border war that threatened its survival. Queen Melisende responded by sending an army led by [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable]] [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]], and Elinand of Bures. [[Raymond of Antioch]] ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Despite Melisende's army, [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa fell]].\n\nMelisende sent word to the Pope in Rome, and the west called for a [[Second Crusade]]. The crusader expedition was led by French [[Louis&nbsp;VII of France]] and the German Emperor [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad&nbsp;III]]. Accompanying Louis was his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], with her own vassal lords in tow. Eleanor had herself been designated by her father, [[William X of Aquitaine|William&nbsp;X]], to succeed him in her own right, just as Melisende had been designated to succeed her father.\n\nDuring the Crusader [[Council of Acre|meeting in Acre]] in 1148, the battle strategy was planned. Conrad and Louis advised 18-year-old {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} to attack the Muslim city-state of [[Damascus]], though Melisende, Manasses, and Eleanor wanted to take [[Aleppo]], which would aid them in retaking Edessa. The meeting ended with Damascus as their target. Damascus and Jerusalem were on very good diplomatic terms and there was a peace treaty between them. The result of this breach of treaty was that Damascus would never trust the Crusader states again, and the loss of a sympathetic Muslim state was a blow from which later monarchs of Jerusalem could not recover. After 11 months, Eleanor and Louis departed for France, ending the Second Crusade.\n\n==Mother and son==\nMelisende's relationship with her son was complex. As a mother she would know her son and his capabilities, and she is known to have been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision-making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or social pressure to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.\n\nBaldwin grew up to be a capable, if not brilliant, military commander. By age 22 however, Baldwin felt he could take some responsibility in governance. Melisende had hitherto only partially associated Baldwin in her rule. Tension between mother and son mounted between 1150 and 1152, with Baldwin blaming Manasses for alienating his mother from him. The crisis reached a boiling point early 1152 when Baldwin demanded that the [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|patriarch Fulcher]] crown him in the Holy Sepulchre, without Melisende present. The Patriarch refused. Baldwin, in protest, staged a procession in the city streets wearing laurel wreaths, a kind of self-crowning.\n\nBaldwin and Melisende agreed to put the decision to the ''Haute Cour''. The ''Haute Cour'' decided that Baldwin would rule the north of the kingdom and Melisende the richer [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in this arena. The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.\n\nDespite putting the matter before the ''Haute Cour'', Baldwin was not happy with the partition any more than Melisende. But instead of reaching further compromise, within weeks of the decision he launched an invasion of his mother's realms. Baldwin showed that he was Fulk's son by quickly taking the field; [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem fell swiftly. Melisende with her younger son Amalric and others sought refuge in the [[Tower of David]]. Church mediation between mother and son resulted in the grant of the city of Nablus and adjacent lands to Melisende to rule for life, and a solemn oath by {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} not to disturb her peace. This peace settlement demonstrated that though Melisende lost the \"civil war\" to her son, she still maintained great influence and avoided total obscurity in a convent.\n\n==Retirement==\nBy 1153, mother and son had been reconciled. Since the civil war, Baldwin had shown his mother great respect. Melisende's connections, especially to her sister Hodierna, and to her niece [[Constance of Antioch]], meant that she had direct influence in northern Syria, a priceless connection since Baldwin had himself broken the treaty with Damascus in 1147.\n\nAs {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} was often on military campaigns, he realized he had few reliable advisers. From 1154 onwards, Melisende is again associated with her son in many of his official public acts. In 1156, she concluded a treaty with the merchants of [[Pisa]]. In 1157, with Baldwin on campaign in Antioch, Melisende saw an opportunity to take el-Hablis,{{dubious|Maybe al-Habis Jaldak, the Cave Castle? No al-Hablis to be found...|date=January 2016}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which controlled the lands of [[Gilead]] beyond the Jordan. Also in 1157, on the death of patriarch Fulcher, Melisende, her sister Ioveta the Abbess of Bethany, and [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla of Flanders]] had Amalric of Nesle appointed as patriarch of Jerusalem. Additionally, Melisende was witness to her son Amalric's marriage to [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. In 1160, she gave her assent to a grant made by her son Amalric to the Holy Sepulchre, perhaps on the occasion of the birth of her granddaughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] to Agnes and Amalric.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat}}\n[[File:Mary's tomb,Melisende IMG 0251c.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Saints Joachim and Anne, originally the tomb of Queen Melisende of Jerusalem]]\nIn 1161, Melisende had what appears to have been a stroke. Her memory was severely impaired and she could no longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on 11 September 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the [[Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat|shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat]]. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox [[Mar Saba|monastery of Saint Sabbas]].\n\nWilliam of Tyre, writing on Melisende's 30-year reign, wrote that \"she was a very wise woman, fully experienced in almost all affairs of state business, who completely triumphed over the handicap of her sex so that she could take charge of important affairs\", and that, \"striving to emulate the glory of the best princes, Melisende ruled the kingdom with such ability that she was rightly considered to have equalled her predecessors in that regard\". Professor Bernard Hamilton of the University of Nottingham has written that, while William of Tyre's comments may seem rather patronizing to modern readers, they amount to a great show of respect from a society and culture in which women were regarded as having fewer rights and less authority than their brothers, their fathers or even their sons.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |author=Hamilton, Bernard|title=Medieval Women edited by Derek Baker; Women in the Crusader States: The Queens of Jerusalem|authorlink=Benark Hamilton |publisher=Ecclesiastical History Society |location= Oxford |year=1978|isbn=0-631-12539-6}}\n* {{cite book |author=Hodgson, Natasha R.|title=Women, Crusading and the Holy Land in Historical Narrative|authorlink=Natasha R.

She was the eldest daughter of King [[Baldwin&nbsp;II of Jerusalem]], and the [[Armenia]]n princess [[Morphia of Melitene]].\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[Jerusalem]] had recently been conquered by [[Christians|Christian]] [[Franks]] in 1099 during the [[First Crusade]], and Melisende's paternal family originally came from the County of [[Rethel]] in France. Her father Baldwin was a crusader knight who carved out the Crusader State of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] and married Morphia, daughter of the Armenian prince [[Gabriel of Melitene]], in a diplomatic marriage to fortify alliances in the region.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\">Hamilton, Bernard, ''Queens of Jerusalem'', Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978, ''Frankish women in the Outremer'', pg 143, ''Melisende's youth'' pgs 147, 148, ''Recognized as successor'' pg 148, 149, ''Offers patronage and issues diplomas, Marriage with Fulk, Birth of {{nowrap|Baldwin III,}} Second Crowing with father, husband, and son,'' pg 149,</ref><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\">Oldenbourg, Zoe, ''The Crusades'', Pantheon Books, 1966, ''{{nowrap|Baldwin II}} searches for a husband for Melisende'', ''feudal relationship between France and Jerusalem'', ''{{nowrap|Fulk V}} of Anjou'', pg 264,</ref>  Melisende, named after her paternal grandmother, Melisende of [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], grew up in Edessa until she was 13, when her father was elected as the [[King of Jerusalem]] as successor of his cousin [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin&nbsp;I]]. By the time of his election as king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} and Morphia already had three daughters:<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Melisende, [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], and [[Hodierna of Tripoli|Hodierna]].  As the new king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had been encouraged to put away Morphia in favor of a new younger wife with better political connections, one that could yet bear him a male heir. Armenian historian [[Matthew of Edessa]] wrote that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was thoroughly devoted to his wife,<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> and refused to consider divorcing her.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> As a mark of his love for his wife, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had postponed his [[coronation]] until [[Christmas Day]] 1119 so that Morphia and his daughters could travel to Jerusalem and so that the queen could be crowned alongside him.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> For her part, Morphia did not interfere in the day to day politics of Jerusalem, but demonstrated her ability to take charge of affairs when events warranted it.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> When Melisende's father was captured during a campaign in 1123, Morphia hired a band of Armenian mercenaries to discover where her husband was being held prisoner,<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> and in 1124 Morphia took a leading part in the negotiations with Baldwin's captors to have him released, including traveling to Syria and handing over her youngest daughter Yveta as hostage and as surety for the payment of the king's ransom.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Both of her parents stood as role models for the young Melisende, half [[Franks|Frankish]] and half Armenian, growing up in the [[Crusader states|Frankish East]] in a state of constant warfare.\n\nAs the eldest child, Melisende was raised as [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/> Frankish women in the [[Outremer]] had a higher [[life expectancy]] than men, in part due to the constant state of war in the region, and as a result Frankish women exerted a wide degree of influence in the region and provided a strong sense of continuity to Eastern Frankish society.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Women who inherited territory usually did so because war and violence brought many men to premature death, and women who were recognized as [[queen regnant]] rarely exercised their authority directly, with their spouse exercising authority ''[[jure uxoris]]'', through the medium of their wives.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Contemporaries of Melisende who did rule, however, included [[Urraca of Castile]] (1080\u20131129), and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] (1122\u20131204). During her father's reign Melisende was styled  as ''daughter of the king and heir of the kingdom of Jerusalem'', and took precedence above other nobles and Christian clergy in ceremonial occasions.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>''''filia regis et regni Jerosolimitani haeres''</ref> Increasingly she was associated with her father on official documents, including in the minting of money, granting of fiefdoms and other forms of patronage, and in diplomatic correspondence.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Baldwin raised his daughter as a capable successor to himself and Melisende enjoyed the support of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'', a kind of royal council composed of the nobility and clergy of the realm.\n\nHowever, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} also thought that he would have to marry Melisende to a powerful ally, one who would protect and safeguard Melisende's inheritance and her future heirs. Baldwin deferred to King [[Louis&nbsp;VI of France]] to recommend a Frankish [[vassal]] for his daughter's hand.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/><ref>{{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} embassy to France was headed by his constable, [[William I of Bures]] and with [[Hugues de Payens]].</ref> The Frankish connection remained an important consideration for Crusader Jerusalem, as the nascent kingdom depended heavily on manpower and connections from France, Germany, and Italy. By deferring to France, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was not submitting Jerusalem to the [[suzerainty]] of France; rather, he was placing the moral guardianship of the Outremer with the West for its survival, reminding {{nowrap|Louis VI}} that the Outremer was, to some extent, Frankish lands.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/>\n\n{{nowrap|Louis VI}} chose [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk&nbsp;V, Count of Anjou and Main]], a renownedly rich crusader and military commander, and to some extent a growing threat to {{nowrap|Louis VI}} himself.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/> Fulk's son from a previous marriage, [[Geoffrey of Anjou|Geoffrey]],  was married to [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry&nbsp;I of England]]'s designated heir as England's next [[queen regnant]]. {{nowrap|Fulk V}} could be a potential grandfather to a future ruler of England, a relationship that would outflank {{nowrap|Louis VI}}. Fulk's wealth, connections, and influence made him as powerful as the King of France, according to historian Zoe Oldenbourg.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/> Throughout the negotiations Fulk insisted on being sole ruler of Jerusalem. Hesitant, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} initially acquiesced to these demands though he would come to reconsider.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>Historian [[Hans E. Mayer]] argued that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had promised sole rulership of Jerusalem after his death to Fulk, however historian Bernard Hamilton points out that there is no evidence to support Mayer's conclusion that Baldwin ever intended to prevent Melisende from ruling, rather the opposite, that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} purposefully associated Melisende, and then Fulk, with his rule up until the time of his death. ''Medieval Women; Queens of Jerusalem, page 151''</ref> {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} perceived that Fulk, an ambitious man with grown sons to spare, was also a threat to {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} family and interest, and specifically a threat to his daughter Melisende. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} suspected that once he had died, Fulk would repudiate Melisende, set her and her children aside in favor of Elias, Fulk's younger but full grown son from his first marriage as an heir to Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/>\n\nWhen Melisende bore a son and heir in 1130, the future [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin&nbsp;III]], her father took steps to ensure Melisende would rule after him as reigning Queen of Jerusalem. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} held a coronation ceremony investing the kingship of Jerusalem jointly between his daughter, his grandson {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, and Fulk. Strengthening her position, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} designated Melisende as sole guardian for the young Baldwin, excluding Fulk. When {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} died the next year in 1131, Melisende and Fulk ascended to the throne as joint rulers. Later, [[William of Tyre]] wrote of Melisende's right to rule following the death of her father that ''the rule of the kingdom remained in the power of the lady queen Melisende, a queen beloved by God, to whom it passed by hereditary right''.<ref name=\"Melisende's youth\"/><ref>''reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat''</ref> However, with the aid of his knights, Fulk excluded Melisende from granting titles, offering patronage, and of issuing grants, diplomas, and charters. Fulk openly and publicly dismissed her hereditary authority. The fears of {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} seemed to be justified, and the continued mistreatment of their queen irritated the members of the ''Haute Cour'', whose own positions would be eroded if Fulk continued to dominate the realm. Fulk's behavior was in keeping with his ruling philosophy, as in Anjou Fulk had squashed any attempts by local towns to administer themselves and strong-armed his vassals into submission.<ref name=\"Oldenbourg's Melisende\"/><ref>Oldenbourg wrote that Fulk had \"broken the resistance of his principal vassals on his own domains and paralyzed all attempts at emancipation by the townspeople. Page 264</ref> Fulk's autocratic style contrasted with the somewhat collegial association with their monarch that native Eastern Franks had come to enjoy.\n\n==Palace intrigue==\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states, with Muslim states (in shades of green) in 1135 during the reign of Melisende]]\n[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f12v.jpg|frame|An illustration from the [[Melisende Psalter]], commissioned during the Queen's reign]]\nThe estrangement between husband and wife was a convenient political tool that Fulk used in 1134 when he accused [[Hugh&nbsp;II of Le Puiset]], [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa]], of having an affair with Melisende. Hugh was the most powerful baron in the kingdom, and devotedly loyal to the memory of his cousin {{nowrap|Baldwin II}}. This loyalty now extended to Melisende. Contemporary sources, such as [[William of Tyre]], discount the alleged infidelity of Melisende and instead point out that Fulk overly favoured newly arrived Frankish crusaders from Anjou over the native nobility of the kingdom. Had Melisende been guilty, the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Church]] and nobility likely would not have later rallied to her cause.\n\nHugh allied himself with the Muslim city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], and was able to hold off the army set against him. He could not maintain his position indefinitely, however. His alliance with Ascalon cost him support at court. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] negotiated lenient terms for peace, and Hugh was exiled for three years. Soon thereafter an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Hugh was attributed to Fulk or his supporters. This was reason enough for the queen's party to openly challenge Fulk, as Fulk's unfounded assertions of infidelity were a public affront that would damage Melisende's position entirely.\n\nThrough what amounted to a palace coup, the queen's supporters overcame Fulk, and from 1135 onwards Fulk's influence rapidly deteriorated. One historian wrote that Fulk's supporters \"went in terror of their lives\" in the palace. William of Tyre wrote that Fulk \"did not attempt to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without [Melisende's] knowledge\". Husband and wife reconciled by 1136 and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], was born. When Fulk was killed in a hunting accident in 1143, Melisende publicly and privately mourned for him.\n\nMelisende's victory was complete. Again she is seen in the historical record granting titles of nobility, fiefdoms, appointments and offices, granting royal favours and pardons and holding court. Of Melisende, William of Tyre wrote \"reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat.\" Melisende was no mere regent-queen for her son {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, but a queen regnant, reigning by right of hereditary and civil law.\n\n==Patroness of the church and arts==\n\nMelisende enjoyed the support of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] throughout her lifetime; from her appointment as {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} successor, throughout the conflict with Fulk, and later when {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} would come of age. In 1138 she founded the large convent of [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)#Roman Catholic Church of St. Lazarus|St. Lazarus]] in Bethany where her younger sister [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]] would rule as abbess. In keeping with a royal abbey, Melisende granted the convent the fertile plains of [[Jericho]]. Additionally, the queen supplied rich furnishings and liturgical vessels, so that it would not be in any way inferior to religious houses for men. According to author and historian [[Bernard Hamilton]], Melisende also gave large\n\n:\"endowments to the Holy Sepulchre, our Lady of Josaphat, the [[Templum Domini]], the Catholic Order of the Hospital (Knights of Malta), the leper hospital of Saint Lazarus, and the Praemonstratensians of Saint Samuel's.\"\n\nQueen Melisende also appreciated a variety of literary and visual arts - her passion and assortment due to the different artistic exposures she received as a result of her parents' mixed Frankish-Armenian union. She created both a school of book makers and a school of miniature painters - a painting style most used in medieval illuminated manuscripts.<ref name=\"Vintage Books\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=72}}</ref> She also commissioned the construction of \"a vaulted complex of shops in Jerusalem, including the legendary (and still surviving) Street of Bad Cooking\".<ref name=\"Vintage Books\"/> The Street of Bad Cooking (Malquisinat) was the central and most famous market of Crusader Jerusalem, presenting specialized merchants and cooks to supply the numerous pilgrims who visited the city with food.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Food|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eating-in-historical-jerusalem|website=The Jewish Mosaic|publisher=Hebrew School of Jerusalem|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref>\n\nMelisende's love for books and her religious piety were very well known. She was recognized as a patroness of books,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=70}}</ref> a fact her husband knew how to exploit following the incident that greatly injured their relationship and the monarchy's stability. King Fulk was jealous of the friendship Melisende shared with Hugh, Count of Jafa.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=152}}</ref> Placed under scrutiny for supposed adultery with the Queen, Hugh was attacked by an assassin who was most likely sent by the King himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=155}}</ref> This greatly angered the queen. Melisende was extremely hostile after the accusations about her alleged infidelity with Hugh and refused to speak to or allow in court those who sided with her husband - deeming them \"under the displeasure of the queen\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=156}}</ref> It is apparent that Fulk set to appease his wife by commissioning her the special book as a peace offering. \"The Melisende Psalter is an extraordinarily beautiful little book that survives today in the British Museum\" - a gloriously decorated gift carefully and thoughtfully chosen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While only 21.6 centimeters tall and 14 centimeters wide, the [[Melisende Psalter]] was ornately and expensively adorned - originally having the entire front cover gilded in gold and with six roundels made of ivory and exquisitely carved.<ref name=\"Melisende\">{{cite book|last1=Tranovich|first1=Margaret|title=Melisende of Jerusalem: the World of a Forgotten Crusader Queen|date=2011|publisher=Melisende|pages=23}}</ref> It has a \"multicolored silk spine\" and the ivory roundels/medallions have studded \"turquoise, ruby, and emerald stones\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> around scenes of King David from the Old Testament, a calendar with all the saints' days/observances marked, and also prayers of worship and adoration - all with extremely ornate illuminated initial letters.<ref name=\"Melisende\"/> The fact that it is written in Latin suggests that Melisende was literate in Latin. An important fact which shows that it was acceptable for noble women in the Middle East to be educated in this way. \nWhile there is no identification placing this book as Melisende's or made with her in mind, there is plenty of evidence that is highly suggestive of her as the sole recipient. The use of Latin text appropriate for a secular woman (as opposed to an abbess or such), the particular venerations of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalen (suggestive of the nearby abbey Melisende patronized and was later buried at), and the only two royal mentions/inclusions being of Melisende's parents all indicate that this book was for her.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> One final indicator that this was from Fulk to Melisende (other than the fact that only a king would be able to afford creating such a piece so pricey) is that there is a carving of a bird on the back cover labeled \"Herodius\" which is also known as \"fulica\" or falcon - making this a stamp pun/play on words to King Fulk's name.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=71}}</ref>\n\nThough influenced by Byzantine and Italian traditions in the illuminations, the artists who contributed to the Melisende Psalter had a unique and decidedly 'Jerusalem style'. The historian [[Hugo Buchtal]] wrote that\n\n:\"Jerusalem during the second quarter of the twelfth century possessed a flourishing and well-established scriptorium which could, without difficulty, undertake a commission for a royal manuscript ''de grand luxe''\".\n\nThere is no account of how Melisende received this gift but shortly after its creation, the royal union appeared stronger than ever. Two things prove the couple's reconciliation: 1) almost every single charter after this was issued by Fulk but labeled \"with the consent and the approval of Queen Melisende\", and 2) the birth of the royal pair's second son, Amalric, in 1136.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> It is also reported that Queen Melisende mourned greatly after her husband fell off a horse and died in 1143.<ref name=\"Vintage Books\"/>\n\n==Second Crusade==\nIn 1144 the [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was besieged in a border war that threatened its survival. Queen Melisende responded by sending an army led by [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable]] [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]], and Elinand of Bures. [[Raymond of Antioch]] ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Despite Melisende's army, [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa fell]].\n\nMelisende sent word to the Pope in Rome, and the west called for a [[Second Crusade]]. The crusader expedition was led by French [[Louis&nbsp;VII of France]] and the German Emperor [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad&nbsp;III]]. Accompanying Louis was his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], with her own vassal lords in tow. Eleanor had herself been designated by her father, [[William X of Aquitaine|William&nbsp;X]], to succeed him in her own right, just as Melisende had been designated to succeed her father.\n\nDuring the Crusader [[Council of Acre|meeting in Acre]] in 1148, the battle strategy was planned. Conrad and Louis advised 18-year-old {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} to attack the Muslim city-state of [[Damascus]], though Melisende, Manasses, and Eleanor wanted to take [[Aleppo]], which would aid them in retaking Edessa. The meeting ended with Damascus as their target. Damascus and Jerusalem were on very good diplomatic terms and there was a peace treaty between them. The result of this breach of treaty was that Damascus would never trust the Crusader states again, and the loss of a sympathetic Muslim state was a blow from which later monarchs of Jerusalem could not recover. After 11 months, Eleanor and Louis departed for France, ending the Second Crusade.\n\n==Mother and son==\nMelisende's relationship with her son was complex. As a mother she would know her son and his capabilities, and she is known to have been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision-making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or social pressure to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.\n\nBaldwin grew up to be a capable, if not brilliant, military commander. By age 22 however, Baldwin felt he could take some responsibility in governance. Melisende had hitherto only partially associated Baldwin in her rule. Tension between mother and son mounted between 1150 and 1152, with Baldwin blaming Manasses for alienating his mother from him. The crisis reached a boiling point early 1152 when Baldwin demanded that the [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|patriarch Fulcher]] crown him in the Holy Sepulchre, without Melisende present. The Patriarch refused. Baldwin, in protest, staged a procession in the city streets wearing laurel wreaths, a kind of self-crowning.\n\nBaldwin and Melisende agreed to put the decision to the ''Haute Cour''. The ''Haute Cour'' decided that Baldwin would rule the north of the kingdom and Melisende the richer [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in this arena. The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.\n\nDespite putting the matter before the ''Haute Cour'', Baldwin was not happy with the partition any more than Melisende. But instead of reaching further compromise, within weeks of the decision he launched an invasion of his mother's realms. Baldwin showed that he was Fulk's son by quickly taking the field; [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem fell swiftly. Melisende with her younger son Amalric and others sought refuge in the [[Tower of David]]. Church mediation between mother and son resulted in the grant of the city of Nablus and adjacent lands to Melisende to rule for life, and a solemn oath by {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} not to disturb her peace. This peace settlement demonstrated that though Melisende lost the \"civil war\" to her son, she still maintained great influence and avoided total obscurity in a convent.\n\n==Retirement==\nBy 1153, mother and son had been reconciled. Since the civil war, Baldwin had shown his mother great respect. Melisende's connections, especially to her sister Hodierna, and to her niece [[Constance of Antioch]], meant that she had direct influence in northern Syria, a priceless connection since Baldwin had himself broken the treaty with Damascus in 1147.\n\nAs {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} was often on military campaigns, he realized he had few reliable advisers. From 1154 onwards, Melisende is again associated with her son in many of his official public acts. In 1156, she concluded a treaty with the merchants of [[Pisa]]. In 1157, with Baldwin on campaign in Antioch, Melisende saw an opportunity to take el-Hablis,{{dubious|Maybe al-Habis Jaldak, the Cave Castle? No al-Hablis to be found...|date=January 2016}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which controlled the lands of [[Gilead]] beyond the Jordan. Also in 1157, on the death of patriarch Fulcher, Melisende, her sister Ioveta the Abbess of Bethany, and [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla of Flanders]] had Amalric of Nesle appointed as patriarch of Jerusalem. Additionally, Melisende was witness to her son Amalric's marriage to [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. In 1160, she gave her assent to a grant made by her son Amalric to the Holy Sepulchre, perhaps on the occasion of the birth of her granddaughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] to Agnes and Amalric.\n\n==Death==\n{{Main|Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat}}\n[[File:Mary's tomb,Melisende IMG 0251c.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Saints Joachim and Anne, originally the tomb of Queen Melisende of Jerusalem]]\nIn 1161, Melisende had what appears to have been a stroke. Her memory was severely impaired and she could no longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on 11 September 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the [[Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat|shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat]]. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox [[Mar Saba|monastery of Saint Sabbas]].\n\nWilliam of Tyre, writing on Melisende's 30-year reign, wrote that \"she was a very wise woman, fully experienced in almost all affairs of state business, who completely triumphed over the handicap of her sex so that she could take charge of important affairs\", and that, \"striving to emulate the glory of the best princes, Melisende ruled the kingdom with such ability that she was rightly considered to have equalled her predecessors in that regard\". Professor Bernard Hamilton of the University of Nottingham has written that, while William of Tyre's comments may seem rather patronizing to modern readers, they amount to a great show of respect from a society and culture in which women were regarded as having fewer rights and less authority than their brothers, their fathers or even their sons.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |author=Hamilton, Bernard|title=Medieval Women edited by Derek Baker; Women in the Crusader States: The Queens of Jerusalem|authorlink=Benark Hamilton |publisher=Ecclesiastical History Society |location= Oxford |year=1978|isbn=0-631-12539-6}}\n* {{cite book |author=Hodgson, Natasha R.|title=Women, Crusading and the Holy Land in Historical Narrative|authorlink=Natasha R.
