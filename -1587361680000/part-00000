As a small town began to take shape at the site of present-day Cotton Plant, those settlers initially gave their new community the name, Richmond.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= Early Days around Cotton Plant |journal= Rivers and Roads and Points in Between | volume=1 | year= 1972 |page= 26 |issue= 1 |location=Augusta, Arkansas |publisher= Woodruff County Historical Society }}</ref>\n\nWilliam Lynch brought cotton seeds with him from [[Mississippi]] in 1846, and the new crop flourished. The community was forced to change its name to Cotton Plant since a community named [[Richmond, Arkansas|Richmond]] was already registered in [[Little River County, Arkansas|Little River County]]. On July 7, 1862, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] units and Cotton Plant locals skirmished with the 1st and 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, Army of the Southwest for the Union, a last-ditch effort by the Confederates to stop [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]]' march to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]].

Warehouses, cotton gins, and a cotton compress brought jobs to the city, and downtown Cotton Plant became a bustling cultural center for Woodruff County. In 1908, the newly completed [[Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad]] opened up the timber industry about Cotton Plant, bringing the Standard Stave and Hoop Mill, sawmills, woodworking factories, and a veneer plant in subsequent years.

As a small town began to take shape at the site of present-day Cotton Plant, those settlers initially gave their new community the name, Richmond.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= Early Days around Cotton Plant |journal= Rivers and Roads and Points in Between | volume=1 | year= 1972 |page= 26 |issue= 1 |location=Augusta, Arkansas |publisher= Woodruff County Historical Society }}</ref>\n\nWilliam Lynch brought cotton seeds with him from [[Mississippi]] in 1846, and the new crop flourished. The community was forced to change its name to Cotton Plant since a community named [[Richmond, Arkansas|Richmond]] was already registered in [[Little River County, Arkansas|Little River County]]. On July 7, 1862, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] units and Cotton Plant locals skirmished with the 1st and 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, Army of the Southwest for the Union, a last-ditch effort by the Confederates to stop [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]]' march to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]].

Warehouses, cotton gins, and a cotton compress brought jobs to the city, and downtown Cotton Plant became a bustling cultural center for Woodruff County. In 1908, the newly completed [[Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad]] opened up the timber industry about Cotton Plant, bringing the Standard Stave and Hoop Mill, sawmills, woodworking factories, and a veneer plant in subsequent years. Hit hard by the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with installing a water and sewer system in town in 1935.

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. She decided to write an uptempo love song rather than a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]], inspired by Segal finding her love for Murphy's unattractive character in the film convincing.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/>\n\nThe lyrics of \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were based on a poem Jackson found which she previously wrote and disposed of.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> The poem's lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> After an early version of the song was created, Jackson requested Jam and Richburg to add more instrumentation, however Jam decided to record from [[Broadcasting#Recorded and live forms|live to tape]] after Richburg left the studio.<ref name=\"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine|last=Rule|first=Greg|date=November 2000|title=Jimmy Jam: Inside Flyte Tyme studios|magazine=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=26|issue=11|pages=32-40|issn=07300158}}</ref> Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nTwo different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack.

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

[[Music of Neon Genesis Evangelion|Music for the series]] was composed by [[Shir\u014d Sagisu]].\n\n''Evangelion'' is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The [[protagonist]] is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]] to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine [[mecha]] called an \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]\" into combat with alien beings called \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\".

Regarded as a deconstruction of the [[mecha]] genre, the original TV series led to a rebirth of the anime industry and has become a cultural icon. Film, [[manga]], home video, and other products in the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|''Evangelion'' franchise]] have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over {{JPY|150 billion}} by 2007 and ''Evangelion'' [[pachinko]] machines selling {{JPY|700 billion}} by 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes}}\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari]], director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses [[United Nations]] forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer [[Misato Katsuragi]] escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining 14 Angels in order to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl [[Rei Ayanami]]. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager [[Asuka Langley S\u014dryu]], who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confused feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.\n\nAfter being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]], incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Arael|Angel]] which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces scientist [[Ritsuko Akagi]] to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of his mother, [[Yui Ikari]]. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. [[Kaworu Nagisa]] replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overridden with guilt.\n\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters}}\n[[File:Characters of Evangelion.jpg|upright=1.81|left|thumb|The cast of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as depicted on the Japanese \"Genesis\" (volume) 14 [[laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] cover]]\n\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality.<ref name=JEN>{{cite news |last=Kosukegawa |first=Yoichi |title=Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth |newspaper=Japan Economic Newswire |date=May 8, 1997 |quote=In the September 1996 issue of the Quick Japan information magazine, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described Eva as a 'personal film,' each character reflecting part of his own personality.}}</ref> The characters of ''Evangelion'' struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems,{{sfn|Napier|2002|p=425}} and traumatic events in their past.{{sfn|Miller|2012|p=85}}{{sfn|Ishikawa|2007|p=76}} The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.<ref name=\"Eng-DVD-commentary\">{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Evangelion: Death & Rebirth; End of Evangelion |medium=DVD commentary track |location= |publisher=Manga Entertainment}}</ref> [[Shinji Ikari]] is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01.

Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process.

[[Music of Neon Genesis Evangelion|Music for the series]] was composed by [[Shir\u014d Sagisu]].\n\n''Evangelion'' is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The [[protagonist]] is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]] to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine [[mecha]] called an \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]\" into combat with alien beings called \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\". The series explores the experiences and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms.

Regarded as a deconstruction of the [[mecha]] genre, the original TV series led to a rebirth of the anime industry and has become a cultural icon. Film, [[manga]], home video, and other products in the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (franchise)|''Evangelion'' franchise]] have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over {{JPY|150 billion}} by 2007 and ''Evangelion'' [[pachinko]] machines selling {{JPY|700 billion}} by 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes}}\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari]], director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses [[United Nations]] forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer [[Misato Katsuragi]] escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining 14 Angels in order to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl [[Rei Ayanami]]. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager [[Asuka Langley S\u014dryu]], who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confused feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.\n\nAfter being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]], incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Arael|Angel]] which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces scientist [[Ritsuko Akagi]] to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of his mother, [[Yui Ikari]]. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. [[Kaworu Nagisa]] replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overridden with guilt.\n\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters}}\n[[File:Characters of Evangelion.jpg|upright=1.81|left|thumb|The cast of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as depicted on the Japanese \"Genesis\" (volume) 14 [[laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] cover]]\n\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality.<ref name=JEN>{{cite news |last=Kosukegawa |first=Yoichi |title=Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth |newspaper=Japan Economic Newswire |date=May 8, 1997 |quote=In the September 1996 issue of the Quick Japan information magazine, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described Eva as a 'personal film,' each character reflecting part of his own personality.}}</ref> The characters of ''Evangelion'' struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems,{{sfn|Napier|2002|p=425}} and traumatic events in their past.{{sfn|Miller|2012|p=85}}{{sfn|Ishikawa|2007|p=76}} The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.<ref name=\"Eng-DVD-commentary\">{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Evangelion: Death & Rebirth; End of Evangelion |medium=DVD commentary track |location= |publisher=Manga Entertainment}}</ref> [[Shinji Ikari]] is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01.

Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" />\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" /> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=\"IAST1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=\"ITRANS1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=\"NatLib\">{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=\"UCLA1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\" /> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" />\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\" /> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=\"IAST1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=\"ITRANS1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=\"NatLib\">{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=\"UCLA1\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\" /> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.
