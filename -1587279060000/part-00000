In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n|doi-access= free\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \"Dying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\" ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111.</ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family.

This disease also weighed on their minds, because they often had to deal with witnessing the death of patients and most often those patients were as young or even younger than they were.\n\n== By race/ethnicity ==\n'''African Americans''' continue to experience the most severe burden of HIV, compared with other races and ethnicities.

While the overall rates of HIV incidences and prevalence have decreased, they have increased in one particular demographic: African American gay and bisexual men (a 4% increase). In America, black households were reported to have the lowest median income, leading to lower rates of individuals with health insurance. This creates cost barriers to antiretroviral treatments. The racial disparities between women afflicted with HIV/AIDS have been made clear in a 2010 study as well, which showed that 64% of women infected with HIV that year were Black women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Riley J.|last2=Finocchario-Kessler|first2=Sarah|last3=Dariotis|first3=Jacinda K.|date=2013|title=Engaging HIV Care Providers in Conversations With Their Reproductive-Age Patients About Fertility Desires and Intentions: A Historical Review of the HIV Epidemic in the United States|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1357\u20131366|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301265|pmid=23763424|pmc=4007857|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> This unequal distribution has led researchers to studying the long-term effects of racial and gender discrimination along with HIV-related stigma, and how this plays a role in people's lives.\n\n'''Hispanics/Latinos''' are also disproportionately affected by HIV.

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis. They kept treatment from these men to see what would happen. [[Henrietta Lacks]] was also exploited when researchers took her cancerous cells and grew them to experiment on them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Man in a White Coat|last=Tweedy|first=Damon|publisher=Picador|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nHomosexuality is viewed negatively in the African American Community. \"In a qualitative study of 745 racially and ethnic diverse undergraduates attending a large Midwestern university, Calzo and Ward (2009) determined that parents of African-American participants discussed homosexuality more frequently than the parents of other respondents.

Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is \"effeminate\", then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. \"Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \"Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nSex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been [[infectious diseases within American prisons|spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons]]. \"Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.\" Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates. There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because \"nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,\" the problem persists outside of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-in-correctional-settings|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Activism and response ==\nStarting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and \"alternative media\" created by those living with or close to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8223-1695-4|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this \"alternative media\" created by activist groups, mass media reports on AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals afflicted with AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HEREK|first=GREGORY M.|date=1999|title=AIDS and Stigma|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en-US|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1106\u20131116|doi=10.1177/0002764299042007004|issn=0002-7642|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2627cf2069a85bbd3ec607ae91cb6fd4d6c6b859}}</ref>\n\nActivist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex.

Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|magazine=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like pride parades, [[World AIDS Day]], or [[AIDS Walk|AIDS walks]]. Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV. While PrEP appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks, specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex.<ref>Holt M, Lea T, Mao L, Kolstee J, Zablotska I, Duck T, Allan B, West M, Lee E, Hull P, Grulich A, De Wit J, Prestage G (August 2018). \"Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013-17\".

In 1987, President Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.

Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Kahn Best\n|first= Rachel\n|title= Disease Politics and Medical Research Funding: Three Ways Advocacy Shapes Policy\n|journal= American Sociological Review\n|volume= 77\n|issue= 5\n|pages= 780\u2013803\n|doi= 10.1177/0003122412458509\n|year= 2012\n|doi-access= free\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], referred to as \"[[Index case|Patient Zero]],\" although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.\n\nAn early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name=\"NIOSH Bloodborne\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Bloodborne Infectious Diseases HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus\n  | publisher = US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n  | date = March 10, 2010\n  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/\n  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nActivists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of \"celebrity\" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).\n\nGallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the \"French virus\" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to \"share\" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.\n\nPublicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a \"gay plague\". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.<ref>Small, Neil. \"Dying in a Public Place: AIDS Deaths.\" ''The Sociological Review'' 40, no. 1_suppl (May 1992): 87\u2013111.</ref>\n\n== Perspective of doctors ==\nAIDS was met with great fear and concern by the nation, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were populations that the majority did not think highly of: homosexuals, African-Americans, Latinos, and intravenous drug users. The general thought of the population was to create distance and establish boundaries from these people, and some doctors were not immune from such impulses. During the epidemic, doctors began to not treat AIDS patients, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. A surgeon in Milwaukee stated, \"I've got to be selfish. It's an incurable disease that's uniformly fatal, and I'm constantly at risk for getting it. I've got to think about myself. I've got to think about my family.

This disease also weighed on their minds, because they often had to deal with witnessing the death of patients and most often those patients were as young or even younger than they were.\n\n== By race/ethnicity ==\n'''African Americans''' continue to experience the most severe burden of HIV, compared with other races and ethnicities.

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis.

Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is \"effeminate\", then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. \"Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.\" This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. \"Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).\"<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nThe African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: \"As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.\" Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.<ref name=\"Hill 2013 475\u2013487\" />\n\nSex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been [[infectious diseases within American prisons|spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons]]. \"Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.\" Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates. There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because \"nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,\" the problem persists outside of prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-in-correctional-settings|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Activism and response ==\nStarting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and \"alternative media\" created by those living with or close to the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8223-1695-4|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this \"alternative media\" created by activist groups, mass media reports on AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals afflicted with AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HEREK|first=GREGORY M.|date=1999|title=AIDS and Stigma|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en-US|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1106\u20131116|doi=10.1177/0002764299042007004|issn=0002-7642|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2627cf2069a85bbd3ec607ae91cb6fd4d6c6b859}}</ref>\n\nActivist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex.

Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], coordinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt#v=onepage&q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|magazine=New York Magazine|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).\n\nInitially when the AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were LGBT community members, leading to stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Street science : community knowledge and environmental health justice|last=Corburn, Jason.|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03333-X|oclc=58830060}}</ref>\n\n=== Present day activism ===\nAn effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=2015-07-24|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}</ref> In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.<ref name=\":0\" /> They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy.

Newer activism has appeared in advocacy for [[Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis]] (PrEP), which has shown to significantly limit transmission of HIV. While PrEP appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks, specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex.<ref>Holt M, Lea T, Mao L, Kolstee J, Zablotska I, Duck T, Allan B, West M, Lee E, Hull P, Grulich A, De Wit J, Prestage G (August 2018). \"Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013-17\".

Because of the lack of HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor [[Mike Pence]], despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which could end up being instituted statewide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/24/402034996/hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-grows-with-nearly-140-confirmed-cases|title=HIV Outbreak In Indiana Grows With Nearly 140 Confirmed Cases|last1=Block |first1=Melissa |last2=Adams|first2=Jerome |date=April 24, 2015|publisher=NPR|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criminal transmission of HIV in the United States]]\n* [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]]\n* [[AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs)]]\n* [[People With AIDS]] Self-Empowerment Movement\n* [[HIV/AIDS in New York City]]\n* [[Hank M.

He is best known for his hit singles \"Smoke and Fly\", \"Reggae Souljahs\" and \"Smuggling Weed\". He was a full-time employee for the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture in [[Jamaica]] when he recorded all three songs. His stage name was derived from the [[Jamaican creole]] for \"teacher\" and a shortening of his childhood [[nickname]] \"Demus\".<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20161112/positive-tracks-jameik-king-teacha-dee | title=Positive tracks Jameik king, Teacha Dee | work=The Jamaica Gleaner|author=Carl Gilchrist}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/entertainment/20161021/teacha-dee-does-it-rastafari-way | title=Teacha Dee does it Rastafari Way | work=Jamaica Star |author=Jamaica Star}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Teacha-Dee-travels-Rastafari-way_78907 | title=Teacha Dee travels Rastafari way | work=The Jamaica Observer |author=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nWarren was born on 21 September 1980 in [[Westmoreland, Jamaica]]. He grew up in a little district called Bath where he attended the Unity Primary School. Being successful in his Common Entrance Exams, he was rewarded a place at the prestigious Manning's School from which he graduated in 1997 before relocating to [[Montego Bay]] to live with his mother. Warren then attended the Sam Sharpe Teachers College secondary programme to pursue his teaching career.\n\n==Teaching career==\nIn September 2000, Warren was employed by the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture to teach Mathematics, Integrated Science and Information Communication Technology. He worked at the Glendevon Primary and Junior High School located in Montego Bay, up until his resignation in May 2012, to pursue entertainment.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\nIn May 2005, Teacha Dee began his professional recordings with The Mighty Powpow Productions a major German production label. He recorded \"Life Goes on\" which is a reggae song sung in the melody of [[The Beatles]] hit \"[Ob La Di]\". This song was released in 2006 as part of a compilation CD titled \"First Sight Riddim\". However, \"life goes on\" was not published as \"Teacha Dee\" but as \"Damian Warren\". This resulted in the song been listed on many reggae database sites as belonging to a separate artiste.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\"/>\n\nIn late 2006, he recorded a song titled \"Them A Play\" for [[Dasvibes]]. This was released on a riddim compilation called [[Gloria Riddim]]. The single was the first song on which he was officially recognized as \"Teacha Dee\". All songs recorded after this date were released as Teacha Dee and not his given name.[[File:Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture.jpg|thumb|left|Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture]]\n\nIn 2007, he recorded \"Smuggling Weed\" for Powpow Movements which became his first popular song within the European scene. However, his most successful song at that time was \"Smoke and Fly\". This was recorded as a sound system dub on the \"Kingston Town\" instrumental made popular by an Italian reggae superstar [[Alborosie|Alberto Dascola aka Alborosie]]. This song\" quickly became a sound system's favorite and a huge hit within the reggae clubs.\n\nEarly 2008, Teacha Dee recorded \"Blaming Game\" for Master J Productions. This was a record label based in Montego Bay, Jamaica. \"Blaming Game\" was the first single that was in circulation on the radio stations in Jamaica. Prior to this, his music was gaining a lot of attention outside of Jamaica without the knowledge of many Jamaicans and the Ministry of Education. Teacha Dee also recorded \"Reggae Souljahs\" later that same year that quickly became a popular reggae anthem in Germany. This song was produced by Rootdown Records and released on a various artiste compilation called \"Ilove Riddim\". In August 2008, Teacha Dee started his own label called \"Tenfloor Records\".\n\nAfter some years of study, Teacha Dee accepted the Ras Tafari way of life in June 2010. This brought about a remarkable change in the messages in his music as well as his overall image. In August 2010, he began to focus on his own production company and produced his first collaboration titled \"what i pray\". This song features 'Determine', an artiste famous for a massive hit with [[Beenie Man]]. Teacha Dee released two various artiste compilations quickly after on his label. These were \"Hot Box Riddim\" and \"Thirteen Riddim\" both released in late 2010 and early 2011 respectively.[[File:Teacha Dee April 2013.jpg|thumb|Teacha Dee Rastafarian Picture as of April 2013]]\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Teacha Dee embarked on his first European tour during his vacation leave from teaching. This tour gave a strong boost to his career on the international scene. The people who loved his songs, could now put a face to his music. His first tour included appearances at Yaam and Insel Clubs in Berlin, Faust in Hannover, Magnapop in Krefeld, Petit Prince and L\u00fcxor in K\u00f6ln, Rude 7 in Mannheim, Kulturfabrik in Hildeshiem, Wagen Bau in Hamburg and U-club in Wupertal. The highlight of his tour was his performance at the prestigious Reggaejam Festival in Bersenbr\u00fcck, Germany.<ref name=\"Reggaejam - Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaestory.de/stories/reggae-jam-2011.html | title= Reggaejam \u2013 Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen 2011 | work=reggaestory.de | author=Reggaestory}}</ref>\n\nDuring this trip Teacha Dee recorded for several producers. \"Symbiz Productions\" based in Germany, \"Catchy Grezzly\" based in Italy and \"Soul Force Music\" also based in Germany. In October 2011 immediately after his first tour, Teacha Dee released his debut album entitled \"Reggae Souljahs: Beating Babylon With Music\". This album was released on his own independent record label.\n\nIn April 2012, Teacha Dee returned to Europe for a mini tour. On this trip, he performed in Cantu Italy, Bern Switzerland and Oldenburg Germany. He also did repeated performances in Osnabruck and Mannheim. It was during this time he recorded a collaboration with 'Skarra Mucci' entitled \"Summer Time\" for \"Weedy G SoundForce\" a Swiss-based label. This was how his affiliation with Weedy G Soundforce for whom he recorded many singles began. In May 2012, Teacha Dee recorded \"Sound System\" for Reggaeville/Oneness Productions both based in Germany. He also worked with producers such as \"Catchy Greezly\" based in Italy, Jugglers Music and Deebuzz Music both based in Germany. A total of 12 singles were released that same year for various producers including his own record label.\n\nIn August 2013, Teacha Dee and Utan Green collaborated on a single entitled \"Reggae Show\" on the \" Reggae Jam Riddim\" which was released at the 19th staging of the Reggae Jam festival held in Bersenbruck, Germany. Teacha Dee was a headliner for this festival.<ref name=\"Reggaejam 2013 line up\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaeville.com/nc/festival-details/festival/reggae-jam-2013/ac/festivalLineup.html | title=Reggaejam 2013 line up | work=Reggaeville festival-details|author=Reggaeville}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 July 2014, \"Party Day\" recorded for Germany-based upcoming producers \"Dancehallrulerz\" made it to the number one spot on the official German reggae charts. This chart presented by Jugglerz radio and Riddim Magazine, was the official Reggae chart of Germany. \"Party Day\" held the number one spot on two separate occasions. It went down the charts for a short time before returning to number one spot a few days later. These charts numbered 30/2014 and 33/2014 were posted on 26 August and 22 September respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/08/reggae-charts-germany-302014/| title=German Reggae Chart 30/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=26 August 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/09/reggae-charts-germany-342014/| title=German Reggae Chart 34/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=22 September 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Teacha Dee released his first artiste mix-tape titled \"Rasta Ting\". It consisted of 26 tracks which were released within the European market and was presented by Europe's female sound sensation, Big Mama Sound. In that same month at the 21st staging of the Reggae Jam Festival in Bersenbruck, Teacha Dee's performance was reviewed as \"one of the most reviting\" by irieites.de.

He is best known for his hit singles \"Smoke and Fly\", \"Reggae Souljahs\" and \"Smuggling Weed\". He was a full-time employee for the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture in [[Jamaica]] when he recorded all three songs. His stage name was derived from the [[Jamaican creole]] for \"teacher\" and a shortening of his childhood [[nickname]] \"Demus\".<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20161112/positive-tracks-jameik-king-teacha-dee | title=Positive tracks Jameik king, Teacha Dee | work=The Jamaica Gleaner|author=Carl Gilchrist}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\">{{cite news | url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/entertainment/20161021/teacha-dee-does-it-rastafari-way | title=Teacha Dee does it Rastafari Way | work=Jamaica Star |author=Jamaica Star}}</ref><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Teacha-Dee-travels-Rastafari-way_78907 | title=Teacha Dee travels Rastafari way | work=The Jamaica Observer |author=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nWarren was born on 21 September 1980 in [[Westmoreland, Jamaica]]. He grew up in a little district called Bath where he attended the Unity Primary School. Being successful in his Common Entrance Exams, he was rewarded a place at the prestigious Manning's School from which he graduated in 1997 before relocating to [[Montego Bay]] to live with his mother. Warren then attended the Sam Sharpe Teachers College secondary programme to pursue his teaching career.\n\n==Teaching career==\nIn September 2000, Warren was employed by the Ministry of Education Youth and Culture to teach Mathematics, Integrated Science and Information Communication Technology. He worked at the Glendevon Primary and Junior High School located in Montego Bay, up until his resignation in May 2012, to pursue entertainment.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\nIn May 2005, Teacha Dee began his professional recordings with The Mighty Powpow Productions a major German production label. He recorded \"Life Goes on\" which is a reggae song sung in the melody of [[The Beatles]] hit \"[Ob La Di]\". This song was released in 2006 as part of a compilation CD titled \"First Sight Riddim\". However, \"life goes on\" was not published as \"Teacha Dee\" but as \"Damian Warren\". This resulted in the song been listed on many reggae database sites as belonging to a separate artiste.<ref name=\"Jamaica-Gleaner\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Star\"/><ref name=\"The Jamaica Observer\"/>\n\nIn late 2006, he recorded a song titled \"Them A Play\" for Dasvibes Productions. This was released on a riddim compilation called \"Gloria Riddim\". The single was the first song on which he was officially recognized as \"Teacha Dee\". All songs recorded after this date were released as Teacha Dee and not his given name.[[File:Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture.jpg|thumb|left|Teacha Dee Ras Tafarian Picture]]\n\nIn 2007, he recorded \"Smuggling Weed\" for Powpow Movements which became his first popular song within the European scene. However, his most successful song at that time was \"Smoke and Fly\". This was recorded as a sound system dub on the \"Kingston Town\" instrumental made popular by an Italian reggae superstar [[Alborosie|Alberto Dascola aka Alborosie]]. This song\" quickly became a sound system's favorite and a huge hit within the reggae clubs.\n\nEarly 2008, Teacha Dee recorded \"Blaming Game\" for Master J Productions. This was a record label based in Montego Bay, Jamaica. \"Blaming Game\" was the first single that was in circulation on the radio stations in Jamaica. Prior to this, his music was gaining a lot of attention outside of Jamaica without the knowledge of many Jamaicans and the Ministry of Education. Teacha Dee also recorded \"Reggae Souljahs\" later that same year that quickly became a popular reggae anthem in Germany. This song was produced by Rootdown Records and released on a various artiste compilation called \"Ilove Riddim\". In August 2008, Teacha Dee started his own label called \"Tenfloor Records\".\n\nAfter some years of study, Teacha Dee accepted the Ras Tafari way of life in June 2010. This brought about a remarkable change in the messages in his music as well as his overall image. In August 2010, he began to focus on his own production company and produced his first collaboration titled \"what i pray\". This song features 'Determine', an artiste famous for a massive hit with [[Beenie Man]]. Teacha Dee released two various artiste compilations quickly after on his label. These were \"Hot Box Riddim\" and \"Thirteen Riddim\" both released in late 2010 and early 2011 respectively.[[File:Teacha Dee April 2013.jpg|thumb|Teacha Dee Rastafarian Picture as of April 2013]]\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Teacha Dee embarked on his first European tour during his vacation leave from teaching. This tour gave a strong boost to his career on the international scene. The people who loved his songs, could now put a face to his music. His first tour included appearances at Yaam and Insel Clubs in Berlin, Faust in Hannover, Magnapop in Krefeld, Petit Prince and L\u00fcxor in K\u00f6ln, Rude 7 in Mannheim, Kulturfabrik in Hildeshiem, Wagen Bau in Hamburg and U-club in Wupertal. The highlight of his tour was his performance at the prestigious Reggaejam Festival in Bersenbr\u00fcck, Germany.<ref name=\"Reggaejam - Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaestory.de/stories/reggae-jam-2011.html | title= Reggaejam \u2013 Bersenbr\u00fcck Festivalerinnerungen 2011 | work=reggaestory.de | author=Reggaestory}}</ref>\n\nDuring this trip Teacha Dee recorded for several producers. \"Symbiz Productions\" based in Germany, \"Catchy Grezzly\" based in Italy and \"Soul Force Music\" also based in Germany. In October 2011 immediately after his first tour, Teacha Dee released his debut album entitled \"Reggae Souljahs: Beating Babylon With Music\". This album was released on his own independent record label.\n\nIn April 2012, Teacha Dee returned to Europe for a mini tour. On this trip, he performed in Cantu Italy, Bern Switzerland and Oldenburg Germany. He also did repeated performances in Osnabruck and Mannheim. It was during this time he recorded a collaboration with 'Skarra Mucci' entitled \"Summer Time\" for \"Weedy G SoundForce\" a Swiss-based label. This was how his affiliation with Weedy G Soundforce for whom he recorded many singles began. In May 2012, Teacha Dee recorded \"Sound System\" for Reggaeville/Oneness Productions both based in Germany. He also worked with producers such as \"Catchy Greezly\" based in Italy, Jugglers Music and Deebuzz Music both based in Germany. A total of 12 singles were released that same year for various producers including his own record label.\n\nIn August 2013, Teacha Dee and Utan Green collaborated on a single entitled \"Reggae Show\" on the \" Reggae Jam Riddim\" which was released at the 19th staging of the Reggae Jam festival held in Bersenbruck, Germany. Teacha Dee was a headliner for this festival.<ref name=\"Reggaejam 2013 line up\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaeville.com/nc/festival-details/festival/reggae-jam-2013/ac/festivalLineup.html | title=Reggaejam 2013 line up | work=Reggaeville festival-details|author=Reggaeville}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 July 2014, \"Party Day\" recorded for Germany-based upcoming producers \"Dancehallrulerz\" made it to the number one spot on the official German reggae charts. This chart presented by Jugglerz radio and Riddim Magazine, was the official Reggae chart of Germany. \"Party Day\" held the number one spot on two separate occasions. It went down the charts for a short time before returning to number one spot a few days later. These charts numbered 30/2014 and 33/2014 were posted on 26 August and 22 September respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/08/reggae-charts-germany-302014/| title=German Reggae Chart 30/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=26 August 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jugglerz.de/2014/09/reggae-charts-germany-342014/| title=German Reggae Chart 34/2014| work=Jugglerz Radioshow | date=22 September 2014| author=Lasse}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Teacha Dee released his first artiste mix-tape titled \"Rasta Ting\". It consisted of 26 tracks which were released within the European market and was presented by Europe's female sound sensation, Big Mama Sound. In that same month at the 21st staging of the Reggae Jam Festival in Bersenbruck, Teacha Dee's performance was reviewed as \"one of the most reviting\" by irieites.de. Their list of highlights also included [[David Rodigan]], [[Anthony B]], Alpheus, [[Ken Boothe]], Winston Francis and [[Bitty McLean]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irieites.de/wordpress/?p=9828/| title=Teacha Dee \u2013 Rasta Ting Mixtape| work=Irieites.de | date=24 August 2015| author=Karsten}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irieites.de/wordpress/?p=9354/| title=Reggae Jam 2015 \u2013 Highlights| work=Irieites.de | date=27 July 2015| author=Karsten}}</ref><ref name=\"Reggaejam 2015 line up\">{{cite news | url=http://www.reggaeville.com/nc/festival-details/festival/reggae-jam-2015/ac/festivalLineup.html | title=Reggaejam 2015 full line up | work=Reggaeville festival-details|author=Reggaeville}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Teacha Dee released a total of ten singles.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006.</ref><ref>Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328.</ref> Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.<ref>Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W.

Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle proposed by [[Anniasnus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W. Burke-Gaffney.</ref> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] noted that Christ was born during the reign of King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]\u2013[[Matthew 2:18|18]]), whose death he placed in 4&nbsp;BC. Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

IPv6 specifies a new [[IPv6 packet|packet format]], designed to minimize packet header processing by routers.<ref name=\"rfc2460\">{{Citation|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|date=December 1998|author=S.

Hinden|authorlink=Steve Deering|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)|rfc=2460}} Obsoletes RFC 1883.</ref><ref name=rfc1726>{{cite web|rfc=1726|title=Technical Criteria for Choosing IP The Next Generation (IPng)|last=Partridge|first=C.|last2=Kastenholz|first2=F.|date=December 1994|url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1726.txt}}</ref> Because the headers of IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets are significantly different, the two protocols are not interoperable. However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} or 340 billion billion billion billion). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses ([[MAC address]]es), because it does not support the [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] addressing method, on which the functionality of the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP, ND) in the [[link layer]], which relies on [[ICMPv6]] and [[multicast]] transmission.<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\"/>{{rp|210}} IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a [[local area network]] (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address.

The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<ref name=\"T.

The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  2017-06-12|website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213.

[[Virginia Tech]] deployed IPv6 at a trial location in 2004 and later expanded IPv6 deployment across the [[campus network]]. By 2016 82% of the traffic on their network used IPv6. [[Imperial College London]] began experimental IPv6 deployment in 2003 and by 2016 the IPv6 traffic on their networks averaged between 20% and 40%. A significant portion of this IPv6 traffic was generated through their [[high energy physics]] collaboration with [[CERN]], which relies entirely on IPv6.<ref>{{Citation|title=State of IPv6 Deployment 2018|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/|page=3|year=2018|publisher=[[Internet Society]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) has supported IPv6 since 2008.

IPv6 was developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of [[IPv4 address exhaustion]]. IPv6 is intended to replace [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"ipv6nz\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipv6.org.nz/ipv6-faqs/|title=FAQs|author=New Zealand IPv6 Task Force|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,<ref name=\"rfc2460\" /> who subsequently ratified it as an [[Internet Standard]] on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"rfc8200\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/07/rfc-8200-ipv6-has-been-standardized/ | title=RFC 8200 \u2013 IPv6 has been standardized | first=Aftab |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Internet Society | date=17 July 2017 |access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDevices on the Internet are assigned a unique [[IP address]] for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.  The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|transition mechanisms]] have been devised to rectify this.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four [[hexadecimal]] digits. The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} or 340 billion billion billion billion). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V.

Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

For example, the group {{IPaddr|0042}} is converted to {{IPaddr|42}}.\n* Consecutive sections of zeros are replaced with a double colon (::). The double colon may only be used once in an address, as multiple use would render the address indeterminate. {{IETF RFC|5952}} requires that a double colon not be used to denote an omitted single section of zeros.<ref name=rfc5952sec422>{{cite web|rfc=5952|title=A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation|author=S.

IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses ([[MAC address]]es), because it does not support the [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] addressing method, on which the functionality of the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP, ND) in the [[link layer]], which relies on [[ICMPv6]] and [[multicast]] transmission.<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\"/>{{rp|210}} IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a [[local area network]] (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address.

The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<ref name=\"T. Narten pp. 54\"/>\n** On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.\n** Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.\n\n===Global addressing===\nThe assignment procedure for global addresses is similar to local address construction. The prefix is supplied from router advertisements on the network. Multiple prefix announcements cause multiple addresses to be configured.<ref name=\"T.

The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

[[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses.

[[Virginia Tech]] deployed IPv6 at a trial location in 2004 and later expanded IPv6 deployment across the [[campus network]]. By 2016 82% of the traffic on their network used IPv6. [[Imperial College London]] began experimental IPv6 deployment in 2003 and by 2016 the IPv6 traffic on their networks averaged between 20% and 40%. A significant portion of this IPv6 traffic was generated through their [[high energy physics]] collaboration with [[CERN]], which relies entirely on IPv6.<ref>{{Citation|title=State of IPv6 Deployment 2018|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/|page=3|year=2018|publisher=[[Internet Society]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) has supported IPv6 since 2008.

Cellular telephone systems presented a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service made the transition from [[3G]] to [[4G]] technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service that would leverage IPv6 enhancements. In 2009, the US cellular operator [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] released technical specifications for devices to operate on its \"next-generation\" networks.<ref name=\"verizon\">{{cite web|author=Derek Morr|title=Verizon Mandates IPv6 Support for Next-Gen Cell Phones|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090609_verizon_mandates_ipv6_support_for_next_gen_cell_phones/|publisher=CircleID|date=2009-06-09}}</ref> The specification mandated IPv6 operation according to the ''3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)'', and deprecated IPv4 as an optional capability.<ref name=\"verizon\" />\n\nThe deployment of IPv6 in the [[Internet backbone]] continued. In 2018 only 25.3% of the about 54,000 autonomous systems advertised both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes in the global [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) routing database. A further 243 networks advertised only an IPv6 prefix.
