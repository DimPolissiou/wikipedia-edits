Its leaves are dusted with white powder on the underside. <!-- to be expanded -->\n\n==Taxonomy==\nLike many [[cheilanthoid]] ferns, this species has been placed in many genera at different times. It was first [[species description|described]] by [[Frederick Traugott Pursh|Pursh]] in 1814 as ''Cheilanthes dealbata'', based on material collected on the banks of the [[Missouri River]]. {{sfn|Pursh|1814|p=671}} [[Gustav Kunze]] independently described the species as ''Notholaena pulchella'' in 1843. His specimen was collected for the [[Berlin Botanical Garden]] from rocks in [[Missouri]]. Initially misidentified as ''[[Notholaena nivea]]'', he noted that the Missouri material was smaller and more highly divided, and commented on the white powder on the underside of the leaves, lacking in Pursh's description.{{sfn|Kunze|1843|pp=633\u2013634}} He subsequently recognized it as synonymous with ''C.&nbsp;dealbata'' and transferred the older name to ''[[Notholaena]]'' as ''N.&nbsp;dealbata'' in 1848, noting that he \"would not have looked for it under ''Cheilanthes''.{{sfn|Kunze|1848|pp=82\u201383}}{{efn|''Cheilanthes'' and ''Notholaena'' were formerly distinguished by the morphology of their false indusia: broken into multiple segments in the first genus and largely continuous in the second. This has since proven to be an artificial distinction, of little value in identifying the relationships between cheilanthoids.}}\n\nDelineating natural genera in the cheilanthoids has proven to be extremely difficult, and other placements of the species were subsequently put forward. [[Antoine Laurent Apollinaire F\u00e9e|F\u00e9e]] transferred it to ''[[Cincinalis]]'' as ''Cincinalis dealbata'' in 1852, breaking with most other authorities in recognizing and re-circumscribing that genus.{{sfn|F\u00e9e|1852}} In 1859, [[Georg Heinrich Mettenius|Mettenius]] rejected F\u00e9e's attempt to delineate ''Cincinalis'' as a separate genus, but recognized the genus ''Gymnogramma'' for species where [[sporangium|sporangia]] were borne along the nerves and not densely clustered at the end of the nerves.{{sfn|Mettenius|1859|pp=49\u201351}} He transferred the species there as ''G.&nbsp;dealbata'',{{sfn|Mettenius|1859|p=50}} but this name had already been used by [[Carl Borivoj Presl|Presl]] for a different species in 1825, rendering it invalid. [[Karl Anton Eugen Prantl|Prantl]] expanded ''[[Pellaea]]'' to include several genera in which he perceived close affinities, including ''Cincinalis''. Accordingly, he transferred ''C.&nbsp;dealbata'' to ''Pellaea'' section ''Cincinalis'' as ''P.&nbsp;dealbata'' in 1882.{{sfn|Prantl|1882|p=417}}\n\nBy the late 20th century, most authorities favored placement of ''Notholaena nivea'' and closely related ferns, including ''N.&nbsp;dealbata'', either in ''Notholaena'' or ''Pellaea''.

He continued to play football at [[Eton College]], winning the House Cup in 1861 with Joynes's House, but was never selected for the school eleven. He first played association football early in 1866.\n\nAs a player, Kinnaird had a remarkable record in the [[FA Cup]]. He played in a record nine FA Cup finals. He was on the winning side three times with [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and twice with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]], and celebrated his fifth Cup Final victory by standing on his head in front of the pavilion. In the course of his career as a Cup Final player, Kinnaird played in every position, from goalkeeper to forward. It was while playing in goal for Wanderers in the [[1877 FA Cup Final|1877 final]] that he suffered the indignity of scoring the first significant [[own goal]] in football history, accidentally stepping backwards over his own goal line after fielding an innocuous long shot from an [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] forward.  The match finished 1\u20131 and Wanderers won with a second goal in extra time.  Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.

This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.
