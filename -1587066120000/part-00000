She worked as an apprentice embalmer in Sacramento, California. On 17 December 1979, she stole the hearse along with the body of a 33-year-old man that was inside. She was sentenced to pay a $255 fine and 11 days in prison.\n\nIn 1987, Greenlee gave a detailed interview called \u201cThe Unrepentant Necrophile''\u201d for Jim Morton's (edited by [[Adam Parfrey|Adam Parafrey]]) book ''Apocalypse Culture''. In this interview, she stated that she had a preference for younger men and was attracted to the smell of blood and death. She considered necrophilia an addiction. The interview was held in her apartment, which was apparently a small studio filled with books, necrophilic drawings, and satanic adornments. She also had written a confession letter in which she claimed to have abused 20\u201340 male corpses.<ref>{{Citation|last=Crafford|first=J.

In 1978, Nilsen committed his first murder and enjoyed intercourse with the victim's corpse, keeping the body for months before disposal. Nilsen was reported to have sexually abused the corpses of various victims until his arrest.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Legality==\n===Australia===\n\nNecrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian law, however, under the Crimes Act 1900 \u2013 Sect 81C it states misconduct with regard to corpses is any person who:\n\n(a) indecently interferes with any dead human body, or\n\n(b) improperly interferes with, or offers any indignity to, any dead human body or human remains (whether buried or not),\n\nshall be liable to imprisonment for two years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s81c.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1900 \u2013 SECT 81C Misconduct with regard to corpses|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\n\nArticle 212 of the Brazilian Penal Code (federal Decree-Law No 2.848) states as follows:<ref name=bpc>{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=C\u00f3digo Penal (Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 2.848) |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |date=7 December 1940 |accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref><ref>Free translation from Brazilian Portuguese to English.</ref>\n\t\t \n<blockquote>Art. 212 \u2013 To abuse a cadaver or its ashes:<br>Penalty: detention, from 1 to 3 years, plus fine.</blockquote>\n \nAlthough sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted of a crime under the above Article.

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi, ZOO Praha 254.jpg|thumb|Jaguarundis are [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] carnivores.]]\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/><ref name=ms/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} vertebrate prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=fws.gov/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coronado-Quibrera |first1=W.P. |last2=Olmos-Oropeza |first2=G. |last3=Bender |first3=L.C. |last4=Rosas-Rosas |first4=O.C. |last5=Palacio-N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first5=J. |last6=Tarango-Ar\u00e1mbula |first6=L.A. |last7=Herrera-Haro |first7=J.G. |title=Adaptability of the threatened jaguarundi (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'' Schereber, 1777) to human-altered environments in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico |journal=Acta Zool\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2019 |volume=35 |pages=1\u201315 |doi=10.21829/azm.2019.3502210 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/310f/6597fd914eb664e160637b4b1b1d57d87fe7.pdf}}</ref> The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can successfully thrive in reforested areas.<ref name=ceballos/> While commonly inhabiting lowlands up to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the sea level, this cat has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Colombia.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the Andes\u2014second only to the cougar in the [[Latitude|latitudinal]] extent of its distribution.

Among the founders of [[Cadillac]], Leland had sold the company to [[General Motors]] in 1909, remaining on as an executive until 1917, when he left over a dispute with GM President [[William C. Durant|William Durant]].  Naming Lincoln Motor Company after Abraham Lincoln, the first President for whom he ever voted (1864), Leland financed the company by securing a $10 million contract to build [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12 aircraft engines]], breaking ground on the [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant]].  To build the Liberty engines, Lincoln sourced parts from other manufacturers; along with cylinders produced by Ford, other parts were sourced from [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], and [[Packard]].<ref name=\"lincolnbrief2\">{{cite book|url=http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|title=Lincoln Motor Company Briefing Book|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|quote=1917 August: After departing a management position at the Cadillac Division of General Motors, Henry Leland and his son Wilfred Leland form the Lincoln Motor Company, which produces aircraft engines to fill World War I government contracts.|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403124132/http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=\"ocallaghan2\">{{cite book|title=The Aviation Legacy of Henry & Edsel Ford|last=O'Callaghan|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-928623-01-4|location=Detroit}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013164}}  In total, 6,500 Liberty V12 engines were produced by Lincoln before the end of World War I ceased wartime production.\n\nFollowing a complete retooling for automobile production, Lincoln Motor Company developed its first automobile, the [[Lincoln L-Series|Lincoln Model L]] on September 16, 1920.  Intended as a rival for Cadillac and similar luxury car manufacturers, the Model L was powered by a [[L-head]] V8 engine, derived from the technology of the Liberty V12.\n\n==== Purchase by Ford Motor Company ====\nDuring the early 1920s, Lincoln Motor Company struggled with the shift from military to automobile production, with some customers having to wait nearly a year for their vehicles to be completed from the time of purchase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z8865/lincoln-model-l.aspx|title=1917 Lincoln Model L Pictures, History, Value, Research, News - conceptcarz.com|work=conceptcarz.com|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>  By 1922, Lincoln fell on the verge of bankruptcy and was placed in receivership.

With the acquisition of Lincoln, Ford Motor Company produced a rival for Cadillac, [[Pierce-Arrow]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], [[Peerless]], [[Duesenberg]], and [[Packard]] alongside the [[Ford Model T]].\n\nIn addition to more closely competing against General Motors in different price segments, the purchase of Lincoln also held personal value within Ford management.  In 1902, Henry Ford had been forced out of his second company ([[Henry Ford Company]]) by a group of investors led by Leland.<ref name=\"bentley2\">{{cite book|title=The Old Car Book|last=Bentley|first=John|year=1952|volume=208}}</ref>{{rp|52\u201357}}  Henry Ford Company was renamed [[Cadillac|Cadillac Automobile Company]]; sold to General Motors in 1909, Cadillac has remained a chief competitor of Lincoln from 1920 to the present day.  While Henry and Wilfred Leland were initially retained to manage Lincoln, on June 10, 1922, both Lelands were removed, with [[Edsel Ford]] brought in to manage the company.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Edsel Ford to Lincoln management, the fortunes of Lincoln began to quickly improve.  For 1923, the Lincoln Model L underwent extensive changes.  While the chassis and drivetrain (including an L-head 60-degree V8) were largely left alone, several new bodystyles were introduced.  In line with a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, customers could also purchase a Model L with coachbuilt bodywork.  For 1923, Lincoln produced 7,875 cars (nearly 45% higher than 1922), operating at a profit by the end of the year.\n<gallery>\nFile:1922 Lincoln touring automobile.jpg|1922 Lincoln Model L touring sedan\nFile:1925 Lincoln - Greta Garbo Car - fvl.jpg|1925 Lincoln Model L sedan (of [[Greta Garbo]])\nFile:1926 Lincoln - fvl.jpg|1926 Lincoln Model L town car\nFile:1930 Lincoln (5960260288).jpg|1930 Lincoln Model L sedan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln K-series|Lincoln-Zephyr}}During the early 1920s, Lincoln steered away from the common American automotive industry practice of yearly model changes.  While used to market fresh designs to customers, Lincoln found that its customers had begun to purchase multiple Lincolns (or other luxury vehicles) in different bodystyles; yearly styling changes would not properly accommodate its customer base.  Following the 1930 model year, however, Lincoln chose to withdraw the Model L in favor of a more modern vehicle.  For 1931, the Lincoln Model K was introduced as a competitor to the [[Cadillac Series 355|Cadillac 355]], [[Chrysler Imperial]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], and [[Packard Eight]].\n\nFor 1932, Lincoln became an American manufacturer to produce a \"multi-cylinder\" engine as it introduced its first V12 engine.  While not the first to produce a V12 engine in an American-produced car, in 1933, Lincoln became the first manufacturer to produce vehicles exclusively with V12 engines, as it retired the L-head V8 engine.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Lincoln expanded to two model lines for the first time.  As Lincoln shifted the Model K upwards in price, Edsel Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Zephyr]] as a sub-marque within Lincoln for 1936.<ref name=\"dammann4\">{{cite book|title=The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|last1=Dammann|first1=George H.|last2=Wagner|first2=James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263}}</ref>{{rp|155}}  Designed to compete against the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] and [[Chrysler Airstream]], the Lincoln Zephyr introduced an all-new body and chassis, along with its [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|own V12 engine]].  As a result, Lincoln sales increased ninefold from 1935 to 1936.<ref>{{cite book|title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car|last=Burgess-White|first=David|publisher=Orbis Publishing|year=1974|editor1-last=Ward|editor1-first=Ian|volume=vol. 10|asin=B008G7ICEK}}</ref>{{rp|1196\u20131197}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln K 1.jpg|1931 Lincoln Model K\nFile:1932 Lincoln 507 Sedan pic2.JPG|1932 Lincoln Model KA (V8) six-window sedan\nFile:1935 Lincoln Model K (14362770852).jpg|1935 Lincoln Model K\nFile:Lincoln Zephyr V12 4-D Sedan 1938 2.jpg|1938 Lincoln-Zephyr 4-door sedan\nFile:1938 Lincoln K V-12 LeBaron Convertible Sedan - fvl.jpg|1938 Lincoln Model K Convertible Sedan (body by LeBaron)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Beginning of Lincoln Continental ====\n{{Main|Lincoln Continental}}In the late 1930s, Edsel Ford began to consider American cars too boxy.  In late 1938, to develop a European-style car for his next Florida vacation, he commissioned Ford Chief Stylist [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|E. T. Gregorie]] to design a [[Bespoke|one-off]]  body design, using a 1939 Lincoln Zephyr Convertible Coupe chassis.  After [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]] the body {{convert|4|in|0}}, the running boards were deleted and a spare tire was mounted behind the trunklid.\n\nAfter Edsel Ford received the car and vacationed in Florida with the one-off vehicle, it attracted a high amount of interest from potential buyers, often referring to its \"European\" or \"Continental\" exterior design.  From the latter term, the one-off vehicle became known as the [[Lincoln Continental]].\n\n=== 1940s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln H-series|Lincoln Custom|Lincoln EL-series}}Following the Great Depression, a number of American luxury car manufacturers were either forced into closure or reorganization; by 1940, alongside Lincoln, the American luxury-car segment largely consisted of Cadillac (who ended production of the LaSalle and V16 in 1940), the Chrysler Imperial (reduced to 8-passenger sedans and limousines), and Packard.  To further secure the future for Lincoln, on April 30, 1940, Ford Motor Company reorganized Lincoln Motor Company as the Lincoln Division of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|199}}  While previously operating as an autonomous entity, as a division, Lincoln structurally became similar to its major competitor Cadillac (within General Motors).\n\nAs part of the change, several changes were made to the Lincoln model line.  Following the positive feedback of the 1939 Lincoln Continental one-off convertible built for Edsel Ford, the Lincoln Continental was introduced as a Lincoln-Zephyr production model for 1940.  For 1941, Lincoln revised its branding; the hyphen was removed from Lincoln-Zephyr, making it a Lincoln.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|206}}  As a replacement for the expensive Model K, an extended-wheelbase [[Lincoln Custom]] variant of the Lincoln Zephyr was developed.  Following the development of proper tooling, the Lincoln Continental began production on the assembly line, replacing hand-built construction.\n\nAfter the entry of the United States into World War II, as with all U.S. auto manufacturers, Lincoln ended automobile production as Ford Motor Company concentrated on wartime manufacturing.  Following the conclusion of the war in 1945, the structure of Lincoln within Ford changed again, as the Lincoln-Mercury Division was created, pairing Mercury and Lincoln together; from 1945 to the 2010 closure of Mercury, the two divisions were paired together within Ford.\n\nFor 1946, Lincoln returned to production, ending the use of the Zephyr name.  Code-named the [[Lincoln H-series|H-series]], non-Continental Lincolns were identified by their body style.  Using slightly updated exteriors from 1942, the 1946 Lincolns continued the use of the Zephyr chassis.  1948 marked the final year of the Zephyr chassis (dating to 1936)  and (as of 2018) the use of a V12 engine in an American mass-produced automobile.  After 5,322 were produced (as both a Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln), Lincoln ended production of the Continental.\n\nFor 1949, all three Ford Motor Company divisions debuted their first postwar designs.  Sharing its body structure with the [[Mercury Eight]], the redesigned Lincoln model line (code-named the [[Lincoln EL-series|EL-series]]) marked the first use of a V8 in a Lincoln since 1932. An all-new V12 intended for Lincoln was stillborn in development, leading the division to adapt a [[Ford flathead V8]] (from the Ford F-8 conventional truck).  As with the previous Lincoln Continental, the 1949 Lincoln dispensed with running boards completely, moving on to abandon [[Ponton (car)|pontoon styling]] entirely, with a straight fender line (and low hoodline) from headlamp to taillamp.  In a carryover from Zephyr-based Lincolns, the 1949 Lincolns retained rear-hinged passenger doors.  As a flagship model of Lincoln, the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] was styled with its own rear roofline.\n<gallery>\nFile:1940 Lincoln Zephyr (7810992862).jpg|1940 Lincoln Zephyr\nFile:1942 Lincoln Continental Coupe (32768154751).jpg|1942 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:1946 Lincoln (4214298318).jpg|1946 Lincoln (coupe)\nFile:'48 Lincoln V12 (A&W St. Leonard).JPG|1948 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Continental Coupe 1948.jpg|1948 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Convertible Coupe.jpg|1949 Lincoln (convertible)\nFile:Lincoln Cosmopolitan 1949.jpg|1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1950s, Ford Motor Company sought to increase the differentiation between the Mercury and Lincoln model lines.  For 1952, to add interest to the brand, Lincoln returned to model names for the first time since 1942, with the Lincoln Cosmopolitan becoming the standard Lincoln model, with the [[Lincoln Capri]] becoming the flagship model line.  In a return to (small) pontoon rear fenders, Lincolns shared a body with the Mercury Monterey.  Mechanically, Lincoln differed from Mercury, as the Ford truck V8 was replaced by the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|Lincoln Y-block V8]] with a [[Hydramatic]] transmission.  For the first time since the discontinuation of the Model K, Lincolns were produced with front-hinged rear doors.\n\nFor 1956, the shared Lincoln-Mercury body underwent a redesign for the final time, with Lincoln adopting elements from the [[Mercury XM-800]] and [[Lincoln Futura]] concept cars. Slotted above the Lincoln Capri, the [[Lincoln Premiere]] adapted features of the Continental Mark II, including its ducted air conditioning.\n\nDuring 1956, Lincoln-Mercury was reorganized slightly, following the creation of the free-standing Edsel and Continental divisions, Lincoln-Mercury was changed to Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (MEL), with Edsel slotted alongside/below Mercury and Continental above Lincoln, as the flagship of all of Ford Motor Company. By the end of 1959, Continental was integrated into Lincoln and Edsel was withdrawn.\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company Plant, built in Detroit, Michigan, by Henry Leland in 1917, was closed after 1952; subsequent Lincolns were produced alongside Mercury Montereys and Mercury Montclairs. For the 1957 model year, Ford opened [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] in [[Wixom, Michigan]], as a facility to specialize in Lincoln production. From 1957 to 2007, the facility produced Lincoln vehicles nearly exclusively, along with the [[Ford GT]] and several generations of the [[Ford Thunderbird]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1950 Lincoln standard four-door sedan, Lime Rock.jpg|1950 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Capri Sedan 1953.jpg|1953 Lincoln Capri\nFile:1955 Lincoln Capri (7867895468).jpg|1955 Lincoln Capri\nFile:Lincoln Premiere 1956.jpg|1956 Lincoln Premiere\nFile:1957 Lincoln Premiere 4 door Hardtop Landau (33112700972).jpg|1957 Lincoln Premiere Landau (4-door hardtop)\nFile:1959 Lincoln Premier 2-door hardtop.JPG|1959 Lincoln Premiere \n</gallery>\n\n====Continental Division (1956\u20131959)====\n{{main|Continental Mark II}}\n[[File:1956_Continental_Mark_II_-_midnight_blue_-_fvr.jpg|thumb|1956 Continental Mark II]]\nFor the 1956 model year, Ford Motor Company created the Continental Division, slotted above Lincoln as the flagship marque of Ford Motor Company. At its launch, Continental introduced the [[Continental Mark II]] as its model line, intended as a successor to the 1940\u20131948 Lincoln Continental personal luxury car. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II broke from a number of American styling precedents of the time. While fitted with whitewall tires, the exterior was fitted with minimal chrome trim on the body sides; tailfins were left off of the body completely. In place of the bumper-mounted spare tire of the original Lincoln Continental, the trunklid of the Mark II showcased the design element, with a large imitation spare tire bulge (which fit over the actual spare tire inside the trunk). The Mark II was largely hand-built, with extensive quality testing done to each engine and transmission before leaving the factory.\n\nIn place of establishing a separate sales and service network for Continental, the Mark II was marketed through Lincoln (the Mark II used a Lincoln engine and transmission). At  $10,000 in 1956 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10,000|1956}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}), the Mark II was the most expensive car produced by an American automaker at the time, rivaling the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] in price.\n\nOn July 18, 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into Lincoln which continued to manage the Continental brand as a separate marque.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|281}}  During the 1957 model year, the Mark II was withdrawn, largely as a consequence of its hand-built construction; each unit was sold at a loss of over $1,000. Subsequently, the 1957 [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation (1957\u20131960)|Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] overtook the Mark II as the most expensive American-produced vehicle.\n\nFor 1958, as part of a mandated $4000 reduction in price, Continental adopted the body of Lincoln, expanding into multiple body styles for the Mark III (the nomenclature indicating the transition). Adding a feature of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], Continental adopted a retractable rear window across every bodystyle (including convertibles) with a reverse-slant rear roofline. For 1959, the Mark III was renamed the Mark IV, becoming the Mark V for 1960.<ref name=\"dammann4\" />{{rp|331,337,414, 582\u2013583}}\n\nIn 1959, the Continental marque was formally brought to an end within Lincoln; for 1960, the Mark V was brought to production as the ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'', ending the model cycle alongside the standard Lincoln model line.\n\n====Unibody vehicles====\n[[File:1959 Lincoln Continental.JPG|thumb|1959 Continental Mark IV Town Car formal-roof sedan]]\nFor the 1958 model year, the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) division adapted new bodies across its vehicle lines. In addition to Mercury sharing its bodies with the premium Edsels (prior to the latter's demise), Lincoln and Continental adopted a common body structure, shifting to unibody construction. With a 131-inch wheelbase, the new platform would be among the largest vehicles ever built by Ford Motor Company; they are the longest Lincolns ever built without [[5 mph bumper]]s, a [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|regulatory mandate]] which went into effect in September 1972.\n\nAs a replacement for the Y-block V8, Ford developed a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|\"MEL\"]] V8 as standard equipment for Lincolns (which was also available in Ford Thunderbirds and some Mercury vehicles).\n\nFor 1959, Continental developed Town Car and Limousine variants of the standard four-door sedan. In place of extending the wheelbase, the reverse-slant roofline was replaced by a formal notchback configuration, allowing the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches. Among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever produced, the Town Car and Limousines were only offered painted in black.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nFrom 1958 to 1960, Lincoln would lose over $60 million.  Following the recession economy of the late 1950s (a factor that would play into the demise of Edsel), Ford Motor Company was forced to recoup the development costs of a vehicle platform that Lincoln shared with neither Ford nor Mercury (with the lone exception of the engine and transmission).  By 1958, the future of Lincoln-Mercury was at risk, with Ford President [[Robert McNamara]] considering the reduction of Ford to its namesake brand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental7.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}</ref>  As a condition of allowing Lincoln to continue production, McNamara required the Lincoln model line to undergo a reduction in size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lineup to a single model line, with the Lincoln Continental replacing the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere; as the Continental marque was withdrawn, the Mark V saw no successor.  While only nominally lighter than the 1960 Lincoln, the 1961 Lincoln Continental adapted a far smaller exterior footprint, shedding 15 inches in length and 8 inches of wheelbase.  In an effort to streamline production, only four-door body styles were produced, with the Continental becoming the sole mass-produced four-door convertible sold in North America; to maximize rear-seat egress, Lincoln returned to the use of rear [[suicide doors]].\n\nIn another requirement to ensure its survival, the model cycle of Lincoln was extended from three years to nine years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental1.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  While largely dispensing with major yearly model changes, the decision established design consistency and shifting resources towards quality control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1969-lincoln-continental.htm|title=1966-1969 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-09-04|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  For 1966, to better compete with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown/LeBaron Coupe, Lincoln added a two-door hardtop to the Continental model line.

While the Lincoln Continental served as a close competitor to the Cadillac de Ville series and Chrysler Imperial, as Cadillac shifted the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] to the personal luxury segment in 1967, a segment that Ford exited in 1957 after the withdrawal of the Continental Mark II.  As a response, in April 1968, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] was released as a 1969 model.  While not officially a Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, who would service the vehicle. Over a number of various names considered for the vehicle, Continental Mark III was chosen, as Henry Ford II felt the Continental Mark II did not have a proper successor (thus restarting the nomenclature).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars9.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the 1968 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark III marked the debut of the (then-new) 460 cubic-inch V8 and became the first Ford vehicle to be fitted with anti-lock brakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldorado-seville.com/MarkIII/MarkIII/history.html|title=The History of my Mark III|last=Loidl|first=Gerald|website=www.eldorado-seville.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>  As standard equipment, the Mark III was fitted with power door locks, power seats, and power windows.  In an effort to control its development and production costs, the Mark III was offered only as a two-door hardtop derived from the chassis underpinnings of the four door [[Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  While sharing many styling elements from Lincoln, the Continental Mark III debuted many elements of its own, including hidden headlights and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid (the spare tire laid flat in the front of the trunk).\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (26724699464).jpg|1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (27298635266).jpg|Rear view showing trunklid, 1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III (37118465116).jpg|Interior view, 1970 Continental Mark III\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nWhile the Continental Mark III would bring Lincoln into the decade on a high note, for the American luxury car segment, the 1970s would prove tumultuous. Along with the introduction of federal safety regulations for American-market automobiles (which brought features such as 5-mph bumpers and the end of hardtop body styles), the 1973 fuel crisis would play a significant role in the engineering of American automobiles, forcing Lincoln to develop a compact-size sedan and redesign smaller full-size sedans for the 1980s. As Chrysler withdrew its Imperial brand after 1975, Cadillac became the sole domestic competitor of Lincoln.\n\nFor the 1970 model year, Lincoln made good on its 1958 plan to commit to a nine-year design cycle, giving the Continental its first complete redesign for the first time since 1961. During the 1960s, while sales of the Continental had remained relatively steady throughout its production, the engineering of luxury cars had begun to change among its competitors; to increase design commonality (and lower production costs), Cadillac and Imperial shifted away from brand-specific platforms (with the latter adapting to shared bodyshells with Chrysler). For the redesign of the Lincoln model line, the Continental grew in size. While sharing no visible body panels, Lincoln adapted the chassis of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis (shifting to body-on-frame construction for the first time since 1957). In another effort to maintain design consistency, the 1970 Continental was produced through 1979 with only gradual updates. Along with the mandated addition of 5-mph bumpers, in 1975, the roofline was redesigned (to visually differentiate the Continental from the Mercury Marquis).\n\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of several naming traditions within Lincoln. For 1970, the Town Car nameplate was revived on a permanent basis as a submodel of the Lincoln Continental. Following the use of a Cartier-brand clock on the Continental Mark III, in 1976, the Continental Mark IV began the use of Designer Editions, which saw use on subsequent Continental Mark series models and Lincolns.<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:Lincoln (9831715645).jpg|1971 Lincoln Continental 2-door\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car (35466763535).jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (27331656355).jpg|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe\nFile:Lincoln Continental 1978 6600cc sic dvla.JPG|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n====Lincoln Versailles====\n[[File:'78 Lincoln Versailles (Les chauds vendredis '10) & '09-'10 Nissan Murano.jpg|thumb|1978 Lincoln Versailles]]\nDeveloped as a response to the popularity of the 1976 [[Cadillac Seville]], Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Versailles]] for the 1977 model year. Thirty inches shorter and 1500 pounds&nbsp;lighter than a Lincoln Continental, the Versailles was based on the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]]/[[Mercury Monarch]] (as the Seville was based on the Chevrolet Nova). Outsold by the Seville by a significant margin, the Versailles was discontinued in early 1980.\n\nWith a smaller design and engineering budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists were unable to give the Versailles the distinct body that was given to the Cadillac Seville. Adopting many features from the 1975\u20131976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]]-style \"radiator\" grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark]]-style trunklid with simulated spare tire bulge. The Versailles introduced two notable features to American-market cars: halogen headlights and clearcoat paint. The Versailles was later criticized for being one of the worst examples of badge engineering.\n\n==== Continental Mark IV and Mark V ====\nFollowing the success of the Continental Mark III, Ford chose to develop a successor personal luxury coupe.  For 1972, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]] made its debut, redesigned alongside the [[Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. While sharing a common roofline with the Thunderbird, from the window line down, the Mark IV wore distinct exterior sheetmetal, with the return of a radiator-style grille, hidden headlights, and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid. To distinguish itself from the Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark IV wore full-height rear-wheel openings, precluding the use of fender skirts.\n\nFor 1976, the Continental Mark IV debuted a new tradition, called the Designer Editions, which later spread to other models in the Lincoln model range. Introduced as four special-edition models, each edition was an option package with color, trim, and interior choices specified by notable fashion designers ([[Bill Blass]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]]). Each edition carried the designer's signature on the opera windows and were fitted with a 22 karat (92%) gold-plated plaque on the instrument panel which could be engraved with the original owner's name. The concept was successful and would continue on other Lincolns until the end of the 2003 model year.\n\nFor 1977, Lincoln-Mercury replaced the Continental Mark IV with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]], a substantial exterior and interior revision of the Mark IV. At over 19 feet long, Mark V is one of the largest \"coupes\" ever sold in North America. In what would become a design theme for Lincolns into the 1990s, the Mark V used sharp-edged exterior styling with a center radiator grille. Following their 1976 success, the Mark IV adopted the Designer Editions option packages.\n\nWhile introduced following the beginning of downsizing among American vehicles, the Continental Mark V would go on to become the most successful of all the Mark series vehicles, with over 228,000 sold across three model years.\n<gallery>\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV front left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV rear left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV, rear view\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (36414930055).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (35579789634).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1980s, the American auto industry remained in the \"[[Malaise era]]\", struggling to balance fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]]; the industry also found itself competing against European and Japanese manufacturers entering segments once dominated by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.\n\nThe entry of the Lincoln into the 1980s was marked with struggle.  As a high point, after a ten-year model cycle, the Lincoln Continental underwent a complete redesign (downsizing for the first time), becoming the lightest Lincoln since World War II.  Again sharing chassis underpinnings with Mercury and Ford, the Continental used the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis.  Coupled with a shift to a 302 cubic-inch V8, the fuel economy of the Lincoln model line rose nearly 40% in a single year.  In contrast, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year.  As a result, by the end of 1980, Lincoln was marketing three versions of one vehicle.  As a response, Lincoln split its two product lines, with the Continental becoming the [[Lincoln Town Car]].  After a short hiatus, for 1982, the Lincoln Continental shifted size into the mid-size segment (using the [[Ford Fox platform]]).  While Lincoln would again compete against the Cadillac Seville (and to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz), the division completely erased any visual evidence of badge engineering.\n\nInitially planned for withdrawal in the mid-1980s until stabilization of fuel prices mitigated fuel-economy concerns, the Lincoln Town Car progressed through the decade largely unchanged.  As its design began to age, the model line began to increase in sales, as transitions of Cadillac to front-wheel drive and further downsizing of its full-size model lines were poorly received by both buyers and automotive industry critics. While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating economy became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior.  Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled ''\"The Valet\"'' which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser [[Buick]]s (Electras) and [[Oldsmobile]]s (Ninety-Eights), with the question \"Is that a Cadillac?\" answered by the response \"No, it's an Oldsmobile...or Buick.\" At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line \"The Lincoln Town Car please.\" The commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising line for the brand, \"''Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.''\" which was used into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJSXyTnOhI|title=Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor 1988, the Lincoln Continental underwent a second redesign.  Splitting from the Mark VII, the Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln, as it became an extended-wheelbase version of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]; the 3.8L V6 engine also marked the first time in a Lincoln that no 8-cylinder (or V12) engine was offered.  In an effort to further reduce model overlap, the front-wheel drive Continental was developed for vehicles that neither Cadillac nor the Lincoln Town Car were marketed against: European and Japanese-produced luxury sedans.  Following the debut of a driver-side airbag in the [[Ford Tempo]], the 1989 Lincoln Continental became the first sedan sold in the United States equipped with standard [[Airbag|dual airbags]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Versailles, 1980.png|1980 Lincoln Versailles\nFile:82LincolnContinental.jpg|1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\nFile:1984 Lincoln Towncar.jpg|1984 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:Lincoln Continental (4282945959).jpg|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental\nFile:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1988\u20131991 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1989 Lincoln Town Car -- 06-16-2011.jpg|1989 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\n</gallery>\n\n==== Continental Mark VI and Mark VII ====\nFor 1980, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]] made its debut, replacing the Mark V.  Originally slated to adopt the Ford Thunderbird chassis as part of downsizing, the Mark VI remained a full-size car, adopting the Ford Panther platform.  Following the departure of Lee Iaccoca from Ford, the development of the Mark VI shifted from stand-alone model range to a four-door sedan and two-door coupe.  Following its marketplace success, many design elements of the Mark V were carried onto the Mark VI, including its sharp-edged sheetmetal, hidden headlamps, opera windows, and fender louvers (now non-functional).  The Mark VI coupe shared the same exact 114\u201d Ford/Mercury wheelbase of the Panther chassis, with its own distinct roofline, while the four-door Mark VI shared its body with the Lincoln Continental/Town Car-Town Coup\u00e9, on a 3\u201d longer wheelbase (at 117\u201d).\n\nThe Mark VI continued the use of the Designer Series (for coupes); in 1982, the option packages began a revision, as the Cartier Edition was moved to the Town Car and the Givenchy Edition was moved to the Continental. In early-1982, the Givenchy Edition was re-introduced to the Mark VI lineup, (via a single-page insert to the showroom brochure) but would last only that year. In another tradition, in 1980, the Mark VI launched the Signature Series trim level.  Initially intended as a direct replacement for the 1979 Collector's Series, the Signature Series designation would also be utilized by the Town Car beginning in 1981; in various forms, it would be used to its 2011 discontinuation...as well as the mid-size bustle-back Continental (for 1982 only). The heavily feature-equipped 1980\u20131981 Mark VI Signature Series (padded vinyl trunk lid tire bulge, color-keyed bumper guards and rub strips, color-keyed trunk carpeting, color-keyed turbine wheels, tool kit, etc.), received a de-contenting of many of these exclusive features for 1982-on, but now offered more colors and options. This ultimately became more of a parallel replacement of the former (1976\u20131981) \u201cLuxury Group\u201d offerings, which was absent from the option list for 1982-on.\n\nFor 1984, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] replaced the Mark VI, again becoming a counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].   The most technically advanced vehicle sold by Lincoln-Mercury at the time, the Mark VII represented a major market shift, becoming the smallest version of the Mark series.  From the 1979 Mark V to the 1984 Mark VII, Ford engineers shed 27 inches of length and over 1,200 pounds of curb weight.  While slightly less performance-oriented than a [[Grand tourer|grand-touring car]], in its development, the Mark VII placed a far greater emphasis on handling capability than any previous Mark-series vehicle, with four-wheel disc brakes, anti-lock brakes, four-wheel air suspension; its 5.0L V8 was shared with the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]].\n\nFor 1986, to eliminate the long-running nameplate confusion, the Continental Mark VII (marketed, sold and serviced by Lincoln) was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII, dropping the Continental nameplate.  The Mark VII would be the final generation of the Mark series sold with a Designer Series name, with a Bill Blass Edition being sold through its production (a Gianni Versace edition was sold from 1984 to 1985), eventually becoming the standard model.  As a sport-oriented model, Lincoln sold the Mark VII LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) from 1984 to 1992.\n<gallery>\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811333464).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811337194).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:Lincoln-Continental-Mark-VII.jpg|1984\u20131985 Continental Mark VII LSC \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhile Lincoln exited the struggles of the Malaise era by 1990, the division found itself in a different struggle.  While largely catching up to rival Cadillac in sales, the brand did so with only three model lines (in place of the seven of Cadillac and four of Mercedes-Benz).  After following the traditional Lincoln model cycle, the Town Car underwent a full redesign.  While mandated by both passive-restraint requirements and fuel-economy improvements, a redesign to the Town Car proved risky, as the model line itself accounted for over half of all Lincoln sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars14.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo meet federal requirements, Lincoln marked the debut of several safety features within Ford Motor Company and within the American luxury segment.  Following the 1989 debut of dual airbags in the Lincoln Continental (1990 in the Town Car), antilock brakes (ABS) made their return on the Continental (1988) and on the Town Car (1992).\n\nIn line with the Lincoln Mark VII, the exterior of the Lincoln Town Car shed many of its sharp-edged lines to allow for a far sleeker body design; other elements remained, including a formal rear roofline, chrome trim, radiator-style grille, and C-pillar quarter windows.  In line with the Lincoln Continental, the 1990 Town Car adopted dual airbags.  Delayed to 1991, the Lincoln Town Car marked the debut of the 210&nbsp;hp 4.6L [[Ford Modular engine|Ford Modular V8 engine]], the first overhead-cam eight-cylinder used in an American car since the [[Duesenberg Model J]].  Built on a revision of the Panther platform, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car shared its underpinnings (but no exterior panels) with the 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]] (dropping the LTD prefix) and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Mark VIII (see below), for 1995, the Lincoln Continental underwent a redesign, introducing a new version of the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]] chassis.  Retaining the use of front-wheel drive, to better compete with Japanese-produced luxury sedans, the Continental was equipped with a 4.6L V8 engine (shared with the Mark VIII, tuned for front-wheel drive).\n\n1998 marked a significant transition for the Lincoln model line.  The [[Lincoln Navigator]] (see below) made its debut as the first Lincoln SUV; the Mark VIII ended its production run (becoming the final Mark-series vehicle).  While the Continental underwent a mid-cycle update, the Town Car received an extensive redesign.  The tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the Mark VIII and the Continental with a completely redesigned interior.  Following the success of the Navigator in the marketplace, 1998 marked the first year Lincoln outsold Cadillac (by over 4,500 vehicles).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers|last=O'DELL|first=JOHN|date=1999-05-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>   \n<gallery>\nFile:90-92 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1990\u20131992 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:95-97 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:LTC Signature 1998-2002.png|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1994 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1995-1997 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\nFile:98-02 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Mark VIII ====\nAfter a nine-year production run (matching the Mark IV and Mark V combined), the Lincoln Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII, remaining a variant of the [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar]].  This was the first generation of the Mark series originally branded as a Lincoln. Further emphasis was placed on handling, with the Mark VIII (and Thunderbird/Cougar) becoming the only American-produced four-seat cars of the time with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel independent suspension.  While the Mark VIII adopted the coupe profile of its predecessor, in an effort to modernize its styling, much of the body was radically streamlined (relegating the spare-tire hump to vestigial status).  In massive contrast from its 1970s predecessors, the Mark VIII was given a cockpit-style interior, with all controls oriented towards the driver.  In various forms, elements of the Mark VIII would be featured in other Lincoln models (the 1995 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Town Car interior), and other Ford Motor Company products (the interior of the [[Ford Windstar]] minivan).\n\nWhile Designer Editions were discontinued, the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) made its return as the flagship Mark VIII model.  During the 1990s, the Mark VIII competed in the mid-size luxury coupe segment, which was in overall decline.  Though positively received by critics and buyers, the Mark VIII was withdrawn after the 1998 model year, outliving the Thunderbird and Cougar by a year.  As of the 2019 model year, the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII is currently the final version of Lincoln Mark series.\n<gallery>\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9674876061).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9678105220).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, front left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, rear left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Navigator ====\n[[File:1st Lincoln Navigator -- 07-11-2012.JPG|thumb|1998-2000 Lincoln Navigator]]\nFor 1998, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Navigator]] full-size SUV, its first new nameplate since the Versailles (outside of the Mark series).  While sharing no common bodywork forward of the windshield, the Navigator was a counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]; both model lines were  mechanically derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]].  Developed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover (P38A)|Range Rover]], [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]], and [[Toyota Land Cruiser#J80 (1990\u20132008)|Toyota Land Cruiser]]/[[Lexus LX|Lexus LX450]], the truck-based design offered increased cargo and towing capability (raised to 8,500 pounds in 1999) over its competitors.  The Navigator also offered standard third-row seating (offered only on the Land Cruiser/LX)\n\nTo distinguish its exterior from the Expedition, stylists adopted several design elements from the 1998 Town Car, including its use of body-color bumpers, chrome license-plate surround (the only chrome on the rear liftgate) and reduced use of chrome window trim (largely to distinguish it from the Expedition); the grille design would later be used on the 2000 Lincoln LS.\n\nIn an extended debut model year, the Navigator became the second-most popular Lincoln behind the Town Car, selling 71,000 examples.  In response, General Motors launched two full-size luxury SUVs marketed against the Navigator, both derived from the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]: the [[GMC Denali|GMC Yukon Denali]] and the [[Cadillac Escalade]]; both model lines introduced third-row seating in 2001.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAs the division entered the 21st century, Lincoln began a period of major transition.  In addition to ending production of the long-running Mark series, the Lincoln Navigator SUV had entered production, nearly unchallenged by European and Japanese manufacturers.  As buyers of mid-size coupes in the luxury segments had shifted towards sports sedans, Lincoln developed an entry for the segment in the place of the Mark VIII.  For 2000, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln LS]] mid-size sports sedan; coinciding with Premier Automotive Group (see below), the LS was developed alongside the [[Jaguar S-Type]].  Though the two vehicles shared a common chassis and related powertrain, no body panels were common between the two vehicles.  The shortest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the LS was developed to compete with European and Japanese-produced counterparts, in line with the [[Cadillac Catera]].  While the Catera was imported from Germany (as a rebadged Opel Omega), the LS was produced alongside the Town Car and Continental in Wixom Assembly.\n\nFor 2002, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first pickup truck produced by the brand and the first Lincoln manufactured outside of Michigan since 1958 (along with the Versailles).  Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the Blackwood was fitted with the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator and a model-specific pickup bed (with imitation wood exterior trim).  In line with its name, all examples were painted black.  The Lincoln Blackwood met with poor reception, due to its limited cargo capability (its pickup bed was effectively a carpeted trunk) and lack of four-wheel drive, leading Lincoln to discontinue the model after a single year of production.\n\n2003 marked a period of transition of the Lincoln model line, as both the Town Car and LS underwent mid-cycle updates (with the Town Car receiving a full chassis redesign), with Lincoln introducing the second generation of the Navigator.  As a complement to the Navigator, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Aviator]] mid-size SUV.  Sharing the body of the Ford Explorer with the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], the Aviator adopted many styling elements from the Navigator, with a nearly identical interior design.  While priced higher than its Mercury Mountaineer counterpart to avoid model overlap, the Aviator struggled to sell, as it competed closely against the Navigator sold in the same showroom.  After 52 years of production, the Continental was discontinued for 2003.\n\nFor 2005, Lincoln introduced a second pickup truck model line, the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].  Again based on the [[Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the design of the Mark LT was partially derived from the poor reception to the Lincoln Blackwood.  While still fitted with Lincoln Navigator bodywork and interior trim, the Mark LT was fitted with a standard pickup bed; all wheel drive was available as an option.  Following lower than expected sales, the Mark LT was withdrawn from the United States (in favor of Ford adding additional content to the Ford F-Series) in 2008; in Mexico (where the Mark LT was the highest-selling vehicle of the brand) Lincoln continued sales of the Mark LT through 2014.<ref name=\"MarkLT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|title=El poder es producto de la superacion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125056/http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|archivedate=January 6, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2006, The Way Forward restructuring plan (see below) began to take effect on Ford Motor Company, with the Lincoln LS ending production.  To replace the LS, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Zephyr for 2006.  In what would be the smallest Lincoln sedan ever, the Zephyr was derived from the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] mid-size sedan.  In an effort to distinguish itself from its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the Lincoln Zephyr adapted styling elements from Lincoln vehicles of the past, including a wide rectangular grille (1960s and 1970s Continentals), wraparound headlamps (late 1960s Continentals), and a twin-pod dashboard (early 1960s Continental).\n\nIn 2007, as another part of The Way Forward, Lincoln began a rebranding of its model line.  As Ford considered the Lincoln Mark series to have high nameplate recognition, Lincoln began to introduce similar \"MK\" branding across the model lineup.  For 2007, the Lincoln Zephyr was rebranded as the Lincoln MKZ (\"em-kay-zee\"), with the 2007 [[Lincoln MKX]] (\"em-kay-ex\") crossover SUV introduced.  Originally slated to become the second-generation Lincoln Aviator, the MKX was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]].  Alongside the Lincoln Town Car, the Lincoln Navigator was not included with the MK rebranding; for 2007, it was redesigned alongside the Ford Expedition, marking the debut of the extended-length Navigator L.  For the last time, a Designer Series Lincoln was produced, as Lincoln discontinued the trim on the Town Car after 2007.  Produced only as a concept car, the 2007 [[Lincoln MKR]] marked the debut of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|Ford EcoBoost V6]].\n\nFor 2009, Lincoln introduced its first all-new full-size sedan since 1980, the [[Lincoln MKS]].  Intended to be phased in as the replacement for the Lincoln Town Car, the MKS was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]].  Built on a Volvo-derived chassis, the MKS was the first full-size Lincoln with front-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive); shared with the Ford Taurus SHO, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 was an option.  Derived from the 2007 MKR concept, the MKS marked the production debut of the \"split-wing\" grille, a design element similar to the 1930s Lincoln Zephyr.  A year later, the division introduced the [[Lincoln MKT]] crossover SUV, a counterpart of the [[Ford Flex]].  Sharing its chassis with the MKS, the MKT was sized between the MKX and standard-wheelbase Navigator.<gallery>\nFile:2002 Lincoln Blackwood 1.jpg|2002 Lincoln Blackwood\nFile:Lincoln Town Car Signature.JPG|2003\u20132007 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|2004 Lincoln LS\nFile:LincolnAviator.jpg|2003-2005 Lincoln Aviator\nFile:Navigator L.jpg|2007 Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2009 Lincoln MKZ.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln MKS -- 01-13-2010.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKS\n</gallery>\n\n==== Premier Automotive Group & The Way Forward ====\nAs Lincoln entered the 21st century, the brand underwent a major transition within the structure of Ford Motor Company.  As Ford expanded its global automotive holdings during the 1980s and 1990s, it acquired Jaguar, Aston Martin, Land Rover, and Volvo Cars.  To collectively manage its global luxury-vehicle holdings, in 1999, Ford organized Premier Automotive Group (PAG).  The same year, the management of Lincoln-Mercury was shifted to the American headquarters of PAG, largely in an effort to engineer and market more competitive vehicles for the brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars19.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe integration of Lincoln into PAG would lead to several product changes within the division.  Following the 2000 debut of the LS sports sedan, the Lincoln Continental was withdrawn in 2002.  To avoid the model overlap that plagued the division two decades before, Lincoln chose to focus production on the Lincoln Town Car, one of the highest-profit vehicles of Ford Motor Company. During 2002, as part of a change of management, Lincoln-Mercury was removed from PAG and relocated within Ford Motor Company headquarters.\n\nIn 2005, Ford developed [[The Way Forward]] restructuring plan in an effort to return to profitability.  Among the seven vehicle assembly facilities slated for closure, Wixom Assembly (home to all Lincoln assembly since 1957, with the exception of the Versailles, Navigator, Blackwood, and Mark LT) was placed third, with an announced June 2007 closure.  After a shortened 2006 model year, the Lincoln LS ended production.  Initially slated for discontinuation after 2007, production of the Lincoln Town Car was shifted to [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Ontario, consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.  In 2011, all three vehicles ended production, coinciding with the closure of that facility.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFor the Lincoln division, the beginning of the 2010s introduced a number of structural changes.  While Lincoln and Mercury were spared by The Way Forward, in 2010, Ford announced the closure of Mercury at the end of the year, with the final Mercury vehicle produced on January 4, 2011.       After 30 years of production as a distinct model line (and 41 years as a Lincoln nameplate), the Lincoln Town Car ended its production run in 2011, coinciding with the closure of St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario.  In contrast to the V8-engined Lincoln Town Car, for 2011, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln MKZ#MKZ Hybrid (2011)|MKZ Hybrid]], a counterpart of the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]].  The first Lincoln hybrid vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid was the first Lincoln equipped with a four-cylinder engine.  Following the discontinuation of the Town Car sedan, Lincoln continued use of the Town Car nameplate, adding it to limousine and livery variants of the Lincoln MKT.  Along with chassis modifications for heavy-duty use, the MKT Town Car features modified rear seating, with the third-row seat removed to create additional luggage space and second-row seat legroom.\n\nTo reflect the end of the Lincoln-Mercury division pairing (from 1945 to 2010), in December 2012, the formal name of Lincoln was changed to The Lincoln Motor Company (its name prior to 1940).<ref name=\"lincoln20122\">{{cite press release|title=Lincoln Forges Dynamic New Path with the Introduction of 'The Lincoln Motor Company' and All-New MKZ Luxury Vehicle|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|quote=The company, introduced as The Lincoln Motor Company, unveiled its all-new MKZ midsize luxury sedan and a strategic plan to reinvent the premium automotive marketplace|access-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206011208/http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>  To help differentiate Lincoln vehicles from Ford counterparts, Ford established separate design, product development, and sales teams for Lincoln.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/automobiles/lincoln-strategy-well-try-anything.html|title=Lincoln Strategy: We\u2019ll Try Anything|last=Dyer|first=Ezra|date=December 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>   In a marketing shift, Lincoln began to target \"progressive luxury customers\". luxury buyers seeking a vehicle solely for their own interests and avoiding ostentation altogether.<ref name=\"valdes2\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|title=Ford Restarts Lincoln Motor Co.|last=Dapena-Valdes|first=Peter|date=December 3, 2012|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203182033/http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|archive-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|publisher=[[CNN]]|quote=As it attempts to revive a once-great luxury brand, Ford's is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co., the automaker said Monday.}}</ref><ref name=\"lincoln20122\" />\n\nAs part of the 2012 rebranding, for 2013, the Lincoln model line underwent several design revisions, headed by the release of the second-generation MKZ.  Retaining commonality with the Ford Fusion (a rebadged [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Ford Mondeo]]), the MKZ adapted a distinct exterior from its Fusion/Mondeo counterparts (nearly unchanged from a Lincoln concept car released in 2012).<ref name=\"valdes2\" />  The MKS and MKT underwent exterior and interior revisions, adopting the \"bow-wing\" grille design of the MKZ.  Also during this time, Lincoln introduced new trim level nomenclatures Premiere, Select and Reserve on the MKZ.  Use of these trim names would eventually be expanded to other Lincoln models.  \n\nSince 2014, Lincoln has enlisted [[Matthew McConaughey]] as a brand spokesman; McConaughey has appeared in commercials for several Lincoln products in the past six years. \n\nFor 2015, Lincoln introduced two new SUVs, with the all-new [[Lincoln MKC]] compact crossover SUV (derived from the [[Ford Kuga]]/Ford Escape) becoming the first Lincoln produced solely with four-cylinder engines.  The Lincoln Navigator underwent an extensive revision, largely to preview buyers of its 2018 redesign.  Along with extensive exterior and interior updates, the Navigator adopted the 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 of the Ford F-150 as its standard engine, becoming the first version of the Navigator offered without a V8 engine.\n\nFollowing the positive reception to a 2015 concept car of the same name, Lincoln revived the Lincoln Continental nameplate for the 2017 model year (after a 15-year hiatus).  Slotted as a replacement for the Lincoln MKS, the Continental was adapted from a version of the Ford Taurus designed for China.  While slightly shorter than the MKS, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln since the Town Car.  The revived model line introduced a new design language for Lincoln; shifting away from the split-wing grille, the Continental introduced a recessed rectangular grille.  The revived Continental marked the debut of the Lincoln \"Black Label\" program for all Lincoln vehicles.  As a flagship trim line, Black Label vehicles feature specially coordinated exterior and interior design themes (similar to the Designer Editions of the Mark series), along with highly personalized customer service.\n\nFor 2018, after an eleven-year production run of its predecessor, Lincoln released the fourth generation of the Navigator.  Integrating the recessed rectangular grille of the Continental into its exterior, the Navigator is distinguished from the Ford Expedition largely from its taillamps and its blacked-out roof pillars (sharing the \"floating roof\" design of the Ford Flex and Ford Explorer).  At a base price of $95,000, the Lincoln Navigator L Black Label is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]] supercars).  The Lincoln MKZ underwent a mid-cycle redesign, adopting the grille design and twin-turbocharged V6 engine of the Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor 2019, the retirement of the \"MK\" naming scheme was expanded, as the MKX underwent a mid-cycle update, becoming the [[Lincoln Nautilus]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-lincoln-nautilus-first-look-review-mkx-replacement-gets-new-name/|title=2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Look: MKX Replacement Gets New Name|date=2017-11-28|magazine=Motor Trend}}</ref>  To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate, Lincoln unveiled the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition, marking the debut of a long-wheelbase Lincoln Continental.  The first factory produced Lincoln sold with a base price over $100,000, the variant marked the revival of the rear-hinged door configuration (after a 40-year absence).  The MKT (including the MKT Town Car livery version) was discontinued in 2019, marking the final use of the Town Car nameplate.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2011 Lincoln MKX -- 03-09-2011 1.jpg|2011 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2013 Lincoln Mk T Town Car NYC.JPG|2013 Lincoln MKT Town Car\nFile:Lincoln MKC 01 China 2015-04-10.jpg|2015 Lincoln MKC\nFile:Lincoln MKX II 01 China 2016-04-18.jpg|2016 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|2017 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln Continental P4220637.jpg|2018 Lincoln Continental\nFile:2018 Lincoln Navigator front 9.22.18.jpg|2018 Lincoln Navigator L Black Label\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2020s ===\nFor 2020, the Lincoln model line underwent further expansion, with the return of the Aviator mid-size SUV (again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer); the revived Aviator offers the first hybrid-electric system in a Lincoln SUV.  The long-wheelbase coach-door Continental is now offered as a regular production model in Black Label trim.  The MKC was replaced by the [[Lincoln Corsair]], remaining a counterpart of the Ford Escape/Kuga.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2020 Lincoln Aviator Black Label in Chroma Caviar Dark Grey, front left.jpg|Lincoln Aviator Black Label\nFile:2020 Lincoln Corsair 'Signature' 2.0L Ecoboost, front 2.20.20.jpg|Lincoln Corsair\nFile:2019 Lincoln Nautilus \"Reserve\" 2.7L front 4.22.19.jpg|Lincoln Nautilus Reserve\nFile:2019 Lincoln Navigator L 3.5, front 8.23.19.jpg|Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", front 10.29.19.jpg|Lincoln Continental\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|Lincoln MKZ\n</gallery>\n\n== Worldwide distribution ==\n\n=== Asia ===\nLincoln vehicles are available in South Korea; most of the product line is sold but the Lincoln Navigator has not been introduced to the country.

Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush.  Along with producing the first purpose-built presidential limousine, Lincoln produced two of the first armored vehicles for presidential use.\n\nA 1939 Lincoln Model K V12 convertible (with a Brunn body) was acquired by the government for the use of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  As a result of its convertible top (to allow the president to appear in crowds without exiting the vehicle), the Lincoln adapted the name \"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\".  In 1942, as a response to the beginning of World War II, the Sunshine Special adapted armor plating and bullet-proof glass; the retractable roof remained in use.  Following the result of the security upgrades, the Sunshine Special expanded to 9,300 pounds.  After traveling across the United States for the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the Sunshine Special was retired in 1948.  Today, the Sunshine Special is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].\n\nAs a replacement for the Sunshine Special, in 1950, the White House leased 10 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitans (9 sedans and one convertible), bodied by [[Henney Motor Company]] with security upgrades from Hess & Eisenhardt.  For 1954, President Eisenhower ordered a removable [[Plexiglas]] roof fitted to the 20-foot-long Cosmopolitan convertible, with the vehicle adapting the \"Bubble Top\" nickname.  Along with the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, Lincoln Cosmopolitans would see use by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once), with the \"Bubble Top\" retired in 1965.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy began use of a modified 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, bodied by [[Hess & Eisenhardt]] of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Code-named [[SS-100-X]], the Lincoln was an open car, designed with a set of interchangeable tops, including a black formal-profile top, plexiglass roof sections and a stainless-steel [[targa top]] for the driver's compartment.  In presidential parades and motorcades, the limousine was often used as an open car (to avoid stress on the cooling system).  In the open configuration, John F. Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in November 1963.  Following the Kennedy assassination, SS-100X was initially investigated for evidence; in early 1964, the vehicle was released to Hess & Eisenhardt, effectively becoming remanufactured.  Distinguished by a shift from navy blue to black paint and the permanent fitment of a roof, SS-100X underwent extensive security modifications, adding armor plating and bulletproof glass.  Retired from front-line service in 1967, the 1961 limousine remained in service until 1977, used by Presidents Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter.  SS-100X is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, along with the Sunshine Special.\n\nDuring the 1960s, alongside SS-100X, the Johnson administration used several Lincolns: including three 1965 Lincoln Continental Executive limousines (two used by the President; one was used by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]) and a 1968 Lincoln stretch limousine, the latter is on display at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nFor the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, the White House commissioned a state limousine based upon a 1969 Lincoln Continental, bodied by Lehman-Peterson of Chicago, Illinois.  While again adopting the armor plating and bulletproof glass and other security features of SS-100X, to allow the President to stand upright and greet constituents from the motorcade, a sunroof was added to the vehicle above the rear passenger compartment.  Used by President Nixon until 1974, the car is located at the [[Nixon Library]] in Yorba Linda, California.\n\nDeveloped for the second term of the Nixon administration, in 1974, the [[Gerald Ford]] administration replaced the 1969 Continental with an armored 1972 Lincoln Continental limousine.  As a result of armor plating and security upgrades, the 1972 Continental was stretched to 22 feet in length, weighing nearly 13,000 pounds.  Used by Gerald Ford, [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]], the 1972 Continental has notoriety similar to the SS-100X, with its presence at two presidential assassination attempts.  In 1975, the limousine rushed Gerald Ford away during the [[Sara Jane Moore#Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford|assassination attempt against him from Sarah Jane Moore]].  In 1981, Ronald Reagan was wounded in [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]'s [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]].  While not directly hit by a bullet from Hinckley, Reagan was wounded by a bullet that had struck the armor plating on the side of the car, richocheting off of the vehicle.  Today, the car is on display at the Henry Ford Museum alongside the Sunshine Special and SS-100-X.\n\nThe last Lincoln used as a [[Presidential state car]] is a 1989 Lincoln Town Car commissioned for [[George H. W. Bush]].  In line with its 1983 [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] predecessor, the roofline of the Town Car was raised several inches to accommodate for the thickness of bulletproof glass (while preserving outward visibility).  To better handle the weight of armor plating and security upgrades, the powertrain was upgraded to that of an F-250 pickup truck, receiving a 7.5L V8 and a [[Ford C6 transmission#E4OD|E4OD]] 4-speed automatic transmission.  Today, the car is on display at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in College Station, Texas.  Since 1993, the Secret Service has used limousines derived from Cadillac vehicles as a presidential state car.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1939 Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Sunshine Special (31609480232).jpg|\"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\", 1939 Lincoln Model K convertible/Brunn body\nFile:Inaugural Parade.

Marketed among the top luxury brands in the United States, Lincoln has competed closely against [[Cadillac]] for nearly its entire existence.  Lincoln has the distinction of establishing the [[personal luxury car]] segment, with the entry of the [[Lincoln Continental]] into mass production in 1940.\n\nLincoln Motor Company was founded in 1917 by [[Henry M.

The Lincoln star emblem is derived from a badge first used on the 1956 [[Continental Mark II]].\n\nFollowing the divestiture of [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Land Rover]], [[Aston Martin]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] and the closure of [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]], Lincoln remains the sole luxury nameplate of Ford Motor Company.  The current product range of Lincoln consists of sedans, crossovers, and SUVs.

Among the founders of [[Cadillac]], Leland had sold the company to [[General Motors]] in 1909, remaining on as an executive until 1917, when he left over a dispute with GM President [[William C. Durant|William Durant]].  Naming Lincoln Motor Company after Abraham Lincoln, the first President for whom he ever voted (1864), Leland financed the company by securing a $10 million contract to build [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12 aircraft engines]], breaking ground on the [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant]].  To build the Liberty engines, Lincoln sourced parts from other manufacturers; along with cylinders produced by Ford, other parts were sourced from [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], and [[Packard]].<ref name=\"lincolnbrief2\">{{cite book|url=http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|title=Lincoln Motor Company Briefing Book|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|quote=1917 August: After departing a management position at the Cadillac Division of General Motors, Henry Leland and his son Wilfred Leland form the Lincoln Motor Company, which produces aircraft engines to fill World War I government contracts.|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403124132/http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=\"ocallaghan2\">{{cite book|title=The Aviation Legacy of Henry & Edsel Ford|last=O'Callaghan|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-928623-01-4|location=Detroit}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013164}}  In total, 6,500 Liberty V12 engines were produced by Lincoln before the end of World War I ceased wartime production.\n\nFollowing a complete retooling for automobile production, Lincoln Motor Company developed its first automobile, the [[Lincoln L-Series|Lincoln Model L]] on September 16, 1920.  Intended as a rival for Cadillac and similar luxury car manufacturers, the Model L was powered by a [[L-head]] V8 engine, derived from the technology of the Liberty V12.\n\n==== Purchase by Ford Motor Company ====\nDuring the early 1920s, Lincoln Motor Company struggled with the shift from military to automobile production, with some customers having to wait nearly a year for their vehicles to be completed from the time of purchase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z8865/lincoln-model-l.aspx|title=1917 Lincoln Model L Pictures, History, Value, Research, News - conceptcarz.com|work=conceptcarz.com|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>  By 1922, Lincoln fell on the verge of bankruptcy and was placed in receivership.

With the acquisition of Lincoln, Ford Motor Company produced a rival for Cadillac, [[Pierce-Arrow]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], [[Peerless]], [[Duesenberg]], and [[Packard]] alongside the [[Ford Model T]].\n\nIn addition to more closely competing against General Motors in different price segments, the purchase of Lincoln also held personal value within Ford management.  In 1902, Henry Ford had been forced out of his second company ([[Henry Ford Company]]) by a group of investors led by Leland.<ref name=\"bentley2\">{{cite book|title=The Old Car Book|last=Bentley|first=John|year=1952|volume=208}}</ref>{{rp|52\u201357}}  Henry Ford Company was renamed [[Cadillac|Cadillac Automobile Company]]; sold to General Motors in 1909, Cadillac has remained a chief competitor of Lincoln from 1920 to the present day.  While Henry and Wilfred Leland were initially retained to manage Lincoln, on June 10, 1922, both Lelands were removed, with [[Edsel Ford]] brought in to manage the company.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Edsel Ford to Lincoln management, the fortunes of Lincoln began to quickly improve.  For 1923, the Lincoln Model L underwent extensive changes.  While the chassis and drivetrain (including an L-head 60-degree V8) were largely left alone, several new bodystyles were introduced.  In line with a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, customers could also purchase a Model L with coachbuilt bodywork.  For 1923, Lincoln produced 7,875 cars (nearly 45% higher than 1922), operating at a profit by the end of the year.\n<gallery>\nFile:1922 Lincoln touring automobile.jpg|1922 Lincoln Model L touring sedan\nFile:1925 Lincoln - Greta Garbo Car - fvl.jpg|1925 Lincoln Model L sedan (of [[Greta Garbo]])\nFile:1926 Lincoln - fvl.jpg|1926 Lincoln Model L town car\nFile:1930 Lincoln (5960260288).jpg|1930 Lincoln Model L sedan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln K-series|Lincoln-Zephyr}}During the early 1920s, Lincoln steered away from the common American automotive industry practice of yearly model changes.  While used to market fresh designs to customers, Lincoln found that its customers had begun to purchase multiple Lincolns (or other luxury vehicles) in different bodystyles; yearly styling changes would not properly accommodate its customer base.  Following the 1930 model year, however, Lincoln chose to withdraw the Model L in favor of a more modern vehicle.  For 1931, the Lincoln Model K was introduced as a competitor to the [[Cadillac Series 355|Cadillac 355]], [[Chrysler Imperial]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], and [[Packard Eight]].\n\nFor 1932, Lincoln became an American manufacturer to produce a \"multi-cylinder\" engine as it introduced its first V12 engine.  While not the first to produce a V12 engine in an American-produced car, in 1933, Lincoln became the first manufacturer to produce vehicles exclusively with V12 engines, as it retired the L-head V8 engine.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Lincoln expanded to two model lines for the first time.  As Lincoln shifted the Model K upwards in price, Edsel Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Zephyr]] as a sub-marque within Lincoln for 1936.<ref name=\"dammann4\">{{cite book|title=The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|last1=Dammann|first1=George H.|last2=Wagner|first2=James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263}}</ref>{{rp|155}}  Designed to compete against the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] and [[Chrysler Airstream]], the Lincoln Zephyr introduced an all-new body and chassis, along with its [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|own V12 engine]].

In late 1938, to develop a European-style car for his next Florida vacation, he commissioned Ford Chief Stylist [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|E. T. Gregorie]] to design a [[Bespoke|one-off]]  body design, using a 1939 Lincoln Zephyr Convertible Coupe chassis.  After [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]] the body {{convert|4|in|0}}, the running boards were deleted and a spare tire was mounted behind the trunklid.\n\nAfter Edsel Ford received the car and vacationed in Florida with the one-off vehicle, it attracted a high amount of interest from potential buyers, often referring to its \"European\" or \"Continental\" exterior design.  From the latter term, the one-off vehicle became known as the [[Lincoln Continental]].\n\n=== 1940s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln H-series|Lincoln Custom|Lincoln EL-series}}Following the Great Depression, a number of American luxury car manufacturers were either forced into closure or reorganization; by 1940, alongside Lincoln, the American luxury-car segment largely consisted of Cadillac (who ended production of the LaSalle and V16 in 1940), the Chrysler Imperial (reduced to 8-passenger sedans and limousines), and Packard.  To further secure the future for Lincoln, on April 30, 1940, Ford Motor Company reorganized Lincoln Motor Company as the Lincoln Division of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|199}}  While previously operating as an autonomous entity, as a division, Lincoln structurally became similar to its major competitor Cadillac (within General Motors).\n\nAs part of the change, several changes were made to the Lincoln model line.  Following the positive feedback of the 1939 Lincoln Continental one-off convertible built for Edsel Ford, the Lincoln Continental was introduced as a Lincoln-Zephyr production model for 1940.  For 1941, Lincoln revised its branding; the hyphen was removed from Lincoln-Zephyr, making it a Lincoln.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|206}}  As a replacement for the expensive Model K, an extended-wheelbase [[Lincoln Custom]] variant of the Lincoln Zephyr was developed.  Following the development of proper tooling, the Lincoln Continental began production on the assembly line, replacing hand-built construction.\n\nAfter the entry of the United States into World War II, as with all U.S. auto manufacturers, Lincoln ended automobile production as Ford Motor Company concentrated on wartime manufacturing.  Following the conclusion of the war in 1945, the structure of Lincoln within Ford changed again, as the Lincoln-Mercury Division was created, pairing Mercury and Lincoln together; from 1945 to the 2010 closure of Mercury, the two divisions were paired together within Ford.\n\nFor 1946, Lincoln returned to production, ending the use of the Zephyr name.  Code-named the [[Lincoln H-series|H-series]], non-Continental Lincolns were identified by their body style.  Using slightly updated exteriors from 1942, the 1946 Lincolns continued the use of the Zephyr chassis.  1948 marked the final year of the Zephyr chassis (dating to 1936)  and (as of 2018) the use of a V12 engine in an American mass-produced automobile.  After 5,322 were produced (as both a Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln), Lincoln ended production of the Continental.\n\nFor 1949, all three Ford Motor Company divisions debuted their first postwar designs.  Sharing its body structure with the [[Mercury Eight]], the redesigned Lincoln model line (code-named the [[Lincoln EL-series|EL-series]]) marked the first use of a V8 in a Lincoln since 1932. An all-new V12 intended for Lincoln was stillborn in development, leading the division to adapt a [[Ford flathead V8]] (from the Ford F-8 conventional truck).  As with the previous Lincoln Continental, the 1949 Lincoln dispensed with running boards completely, moving on to abandon [[Ponton (car)|pontoon styling]] entirely, with a straight fender line (and low hoodline) from headlamp to taillamp.  In a carryover from Zephyr-based Lincolns, the 1949 Lincolns retained rear-hinged passenger doors.  As a flagship model of Lincoln, the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] was styled with its own rear roofline.\n<gallery>\nFile:1940 Lincoln Zephyr (7810992862).jpg|1940 Lincoln Zephyr\nFile:1942 Lincoln Continental Coupe (32768154751).jpg|1942 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:1946 Lincoln (4214298318).jpg|1946 Lincoln (coupe)\nFile:'48 Lincoln V12 (A&W St. Leonard).JPG|1948 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Continental Coupe 1948.jpg|1948 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Convertible Coupe.jpg|1949 Lincoln (convertible)\nFile:Lincoln Cosmopolitan 1949.jpg|1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1950s, Ford Motor Company sought to increase the differentiation between the Mercury and Lincoln model lines.  For 1952, to add interest to the brand, Lincoln returned to model names for the first time since 1942, with the Lincoln Cosmopolitan becoming the standard Lincoln model, with the [[Lincoln Capri]] becoming the flagship model line.  In a return to (small) pontoon rear fenders, Lincolns shared a body with the Mercury Monterey.  Mechanically, Lincoln differed from Mercury, as the Ford truck V8 was replaced by the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|Lincoln Y-block V8]] with a [[Hydramatic]] transmission.  For the first time since the discontinuation of the Model K, Lincolns were produced with front-hinged rear doors.\n\nFor 1956, the shared Lincoln-Mercury body underwent a redesign for the final time, with Lincoln adopting elements from the [[Mercury XM-800]] and [[Lincoln Futura]] concept cars. Slotted above the Lincoln Capri, the [[Lincoln Premiere]] adapted features of the Continental Mark II, including its ducted air conditioning.\n\nDuring 1956, Lincoln-Mercury was reorganized slightly, following the creation of the free-standing Edsel and Continental divisions, Lincoln-Mercury was changed to Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (MEL), with Edsel slotted alongside/below Mercury and Continental above Lincoln, as the flagship of all of Ford Motor Company. By the end of 1959, Continental was integrated into Lincoln and Edsel was withdrawn.\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company Plant, built in Detroit, Michigan, by Henry Leland in 1917, was closed after 1952; subsequent Lincolns were produced alongside Mercury Montereys and Mercury Montclairs. For the 1957 model year, Ford opened [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] in [[Wixom, Michigan]], as a facility to specialize in Lincoln production. From 1957 to 2007, the facility produced Lincoln vehicles nearly exclusively, along with the [[Ford GT]] and several generations of the [[Ford Thunderbird]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1950 Lincoln standard four-door sedan, Lime Rock.jpg|1950 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Capri Sedan 1953.jpg|1953 Lincoln Capri\nFile:1955 Lincoln Capri (7867895468).jpg|1955 Lincoln Capri\nFile:Lincoln Premiere 1956.jpg|1956 Lincoln Premiere\nFile:1957 Lincoln Premiere 4 door Hardtop Landau (33112700972).jpg|1957 Lincoln Premiere Landau (4-door hardtop)\nFile:1959 Lincoln Premier 2-door hardtop.JPG|1959 Lincoln Premiere \n</gallery>\n\n====Continental Division (1956\u20131959)====\n{{main|Continental Mark II}}\n[[File:1956_Continental_Mark_II_-_midnight_blue_-_fvr.jpg|thumb|1956 Continental Mark II]]\nFor the 1956 model year, Ford Motor Company created the Continental Division, slotted above Lincoln as the flagship marque of Ford Motor Company. At its launch, Continental introduced the [[Continental Mark II]] as its model line, intended as a successor to the 1940\u20131948 Lincoln Continental personal luxury car. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II broke from a number of American styling precedents of the time. While fitted with whitewall tires, the exterior was fitted with minimal chrome trim on the body sides; tailfins were left off of the body completely. In place of the bumper-mounted spare tire of the original Lincoln Continental, the trunklid of the Mark II showcased the design element, with a large imitation spare tire bulge (which fit over the actual spare tire inside the trunk). The Mark II was largely hand-built, with extensive quality testing done to each engine and transmission before leaving the factory.\n\nIn place of establishing a separate sales and service network for Continental, the Mark II was marketed through Lincoln (the Mark II used a Lincoln engine and transmission). At  $10,000 in 1956 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10,000|1956}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}), the Mark II was the most expensive car produced by an American automaker at the time, rivaling the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] in price.\n\nOn July 18, 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into Lincoln which continued to manage the Continental brand as a separate marque.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|281}}  During the 1957 model year, the Mark II was withdrawn, largely as a consequence of its hand-built construction; each unit was sold at a loss of over $1,000. Subsequently, the 1957 [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation (1957\u20131960)|Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] overtook the Mark II as the most expensive American-produced vehicle.\n\nFor 1958, as part of a mandated $4000 reduction in price, Continental adopted the body of Lincoln, expanding into multiple body styles for the Mark III (the nomenclature indicating the transition). Adding a feature of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], Continental adopted a retractable rear window across every bodystyle (including convertibles) with a reverse-slant rear roofline. For 1959, the Mark III was renamed the Mark IV, becoming the Mark V for 1960.<ref name=\"dammann4\" />{{rp|331,337,414, 582\u2013583}}\n\nIn 1959, the Continental marque was formally brought to an end within Lincoln; for 1960, the Mark V was brought to production as the ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'', ending the model cycle alongside the standard Lincoln model line.\n\n====Unibody vehicles====\n[[File:1959 Lincoln Continental.JPG|thumb|1959 Continental Mark IV Town Car formal-roof sedan]]\nFor the 1958 model year, the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) division adapted new bodies across its vehicle lines. In addition to Mercury sharing its bodies with the premium Edsels (prior to the latter's demise), Lincoln and Continental adopted a common body structure, shifting to unibody construction. With a 131-inch wheelbase, the new platform would be among the largest vehicles ever built by Ford Motor Company; they are the longest Lincolns ever built without [[5 mph bumper]]s, a [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|regulatory mandate]] which went into effect in September 1972.\n\nAs a replacement for the Y-block V8, Ford developed a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|\"MEL\"]] V8 as standard equipment for Lincolns (which was also available in Ford Thunderbirds and some Mercury vehicles).\n\nFor 1959, Continental developed Town Car and Limousine variants of the standard four-door sedan. In place of extending the wheelbase, the reverse-slant roofline was replaced by a formal notchback configuration, allowing the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches. Among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever produced, the Town Car and Limousines were only offered painted in black.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nFrom 1958 to 1960, Lincoln would lose over $60 million.  Following the recession economy of the late 1950s (a factor that would play into the demise of Edsel), Ford Motor Company was forced to recoup the development costs of a vehicle platform that Lincoln shared with neither Ford nor Mercury (with the lone exception of the engine and transmission).  By 1958, the future of Lincoln-Mercury was at risk, with Ford President [[Robert McNamara]] considering the reduction of Ford to its namesake brand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental7.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}</ref>  As a condition of allowing Lincoln to continue production, McNamara required the Lincoln model line to undergo a reduction in size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lineup to a single model line, with the Lincoln Continental replacing the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere; as the Continental marque was withdrawn, the Mark V saw no successor.  While only nominally lighter than the 1960 Lincoln, the 1961 Lincoln Continental adapted a far smaller exterior footprint, shedding 15 inches in length and 8 inches of wheelbase.  In an effort to streamline production, only four-door body styles were produced, with the Continental becoming the sole mass-produced four-door convertible sold in North America; to maximize rear-seat egress, Lincoln returned to the use of rear [[suicide doors]].\n\nIn another requirement to ensure its survival, the model cycle of Lincoln was extended from three years to nine years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental1.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  While largely dispensing with major yearly model changes, the decision established design consistency and shifting resources towards quality control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1969-lincoln-continental.htm|title=1966-1969 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-09-04|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  For 1966, to better compete with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown/LeBaron Coupe, Lincoln added a two-door hardtop to the Continental model line.

While the Lincoln Continental served as a close competitor to the Cadillac de Ville series and Chrysler Imperial, as Cadillac shifted the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] to the personal luxury segment in 1967, a segment that Ford exited in 1957 after the withdrawal of the Continental Mark II.  As a response, in April 1968, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] was released as a 1969 model.  While not officially a Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, who would service the vehicle. Over a number of various names considered for the vehicle, Continental Mark III was chosen, as Henry Ford II felt the Continental Mark II did not have a proper successor (thus restarting the nomenclature).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars9.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the 1968 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark III marked the debut of the (then-new) 460 cubic-inch V8 and became the first Ford vehicle to be fitted with anti-lock brakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldorado-seville.com/MarkIII/MarkIII/history.html|title=The History of my Mark III|last=Loidl|first=Gerald|website=www.eldorado-seville.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>  As standard equipment, the Mark III was fitted with power door locks, power seats, and power windows.  In an effort to control its development and production costs, the Mark III was offered only as a two-door hardtop derived from the chassis underpinnings of the four door [[Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  While sharing many styling elements from Lincoln, the Continental Mark III debuted many elements of its own, including hidden headlights and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid (the spare tire laid flat in the front of the trunk).\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (26724699464).jpg|1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (27298635266).jpg|Rear view showing trunklid, 1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III (37118465116).jpg|Interior view, 1970 Continental Mark III\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nWhile the Continental Mark III would bring Lincoln into the decade on a high note, for the American luxury car segment, the 1970s would prove tumultuous. Along with the introduction of federal safety regulations for American-market automobiles (which brought features such as 5-mph bumpers and the end of hardtop body styles), the 1973 fuel crisis would play a significant role in the engineering of American automobiles, forcing Lincoln to develop a compact-size sedan and redesign smaller full-size sedans for the 1980s. As Chrysler withdrew its Imperial brand after 1975, Cadillac became the sole domestic competitor of Lincoln.\n\nFor the 1970 model year, Lincoln made good on its 1958 plan to commit to a nine-year design cycle, giving the Continental its first complete redesign for the first time since 1961. During the 1960s, while sales of the Continental had remained relatively steady throughout its production, the engineering of luxury cars had begun to change among its competitors; to increase design commonality (and lower production costs), Cadillac and Imperial shifted away from brand-specific platforms (with the latter adapting to shared bodyshells with Chrysler). For the redesign of the Lincoln model line, the Continental grew in size. While sharing no visible body panels, Lincoln adapted the chassis of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis (shifting to body-on-frame construction for the first time since 1957). In another effort to maintain design consistency, the 1970 Continental was produced through 1979 with only gradual updates. Along with the mandated addition of 5-mph bumpers, in 1975, the roofline was redesigned (to visually differentiate the Continental from the Mercury Marquis).\n\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of several naming traditions within Lincoln. For 1970, the Town Car nameplate was revived on a permanent basis as a submodel of the Lincoln Continental. Following the use of a Cartier-brand clock on the Continental Mark III, in 1976, the Continental Mark IV began the use of Designer Editions, which saw use on subsequent Continental Mark series models and Lincolns.<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:Lincoln (9831715645).jpg|1971 Lincoln Continental 2-door\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car (35466763535).jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (27331656355).jpg|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe\nFile:Lincoln Continental 1978 6600cc sic dvla.JPG|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n====Lincoln Versailles====\n[[File:'78 Lincoln Versailles (Les chauds vendredis '10) & '09-'10 Nissan Murano.jpg|thumb|1978 Lincoln Versailles]]\nDeveloped as a response to the popularity of the 1976 [[Cadillac Seville]], Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Versailles]] for the 1977 model year. Thirty inches shorter and 1500 pounds&nbsp;lighter than a Lincoln Continental, the Versailles was based on the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]]/[[Mercury Monarch]] (as the Seville was based on the Chevrolet Nova). Outsold by the Seville by a significant margin, the Versailles was discontinued in early 1980.\n\nWith a smaller design and engineering budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists were unable to give the Versailles the distinct body that was given to the Cadillac Seville. Adopting many features from the 1975\u20131976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]]-style \"radiator\" grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark]]-style trunklid with simulated spare tire bulge. The Versailles introduced two notable features to American-market cars: halogen headlights and clearcoat paint. The Versailles was later criticized for being one of the worst examples of badge engineering.\n\n==== Continental Mark IV and Mark V ====\nFollowing the success of the Continental Mark III, Ford chose to develop a successor personal luxury coupe.  For 1972, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]] made its debut, redesigned alongside the [[Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. While sharing a common roofline with the Thunderbird, from the window line down, the Mark IV wore distinct exterior sheetmetal, with the return of a radiator-style grille, hidden headlights, and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid. To distinguish itself from the Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark IV wore full-height rear-wheel openings, precluding the use of fender skirts.\n\nFor 1976, the Continental Mark IV debuted a new tradition, called the Designer Editions, which later spread to other models in the Lincoln model range. Introduced as four special-edition models, each edition was an option package with color, trim, and interior choices specified by notable fashion designers ([[Bill Blass]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]]). Each edition carried the designer's signature on the opera windows and were fitted with a 22 karat (92%) gold-plated plaque on the instrument panel which could be engraved with the original owner's name. The concept was successful and would continue on other Lincolns until the end of the 2003 model year.\n\nFor 1977, Lincoln-Mercury replaced the Continental Mark IV with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]], a substantial exterior and interior revision of the Mark IV. At over 19 feet long, Mark V is one of the largest \"coupes\" ever sold in North America. In what would become a design theme for Lincolns into the 1990s, the Mark V used sharp-edged exterior styling with a center radiator grille. Following their 1976 success, the Mark IV adopted the Designer Editions option packages.\n\nWhile introduced following the beginning of downsizing among American vehicles, the Continental Mark V would go on to become the most successful of all the Mark series vehicles, with over 228,000 sold across three model years.\n<gallery>\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV front left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV rear left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV, rear view\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (36414930055).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (35579789634).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1980s, the American auto industry remained in the \"[[Malaise era]]\", struggling to balance fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]]; the industry also found itself competing against European and Japanese manufacturers entering segments once dominated by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.\n\nThe entry of the Lincoln into the 1980s was marked with struggle.  As a high point, after a ten-year model cycle, the Lincoln Continental underwent a complete redesign (downsizing for the first time), becoming the lightest Lincoln since World War II.  Again sharing chassis underpinnings with Mercury and Ford, the Continental used the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis.  Coupled with a shift to a 302 cubic-inch V8, the fuel economy of the Lincoln model line rose nearly 40% in a single year.  In contrast, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year.  As a result, by the end of 1980, Lincoln was marketing three versions of one vehicle.  As a response, Lincoln split its two product lines, with the Continental becoming the [[Lincoln Town Car]].  After a short hiatus, for 1982, the Lincoln Continental shifted size into the mid-size segment (using the [[Ford Fox platform]]).  While Lincoln would again compete against the Cadillac Seville (and to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz), the division completely erased any visual evidence of badge engineering.\n\nInitially planned for withdrawal in the mid-1980s until stabilization of fuel prices mitigated fuel-economy concerns, the Lincoln Town Car progressed through the decade largely unchanged.  As its design began to age, the model line began to increase in sales, as transitions of Cadillac to front-wheel drive and further downsizing of its full-size model lines were poorly received by both buyers and automotive industry critics. While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating economy became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior.  Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled ''\"The Valet\"'' which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser [[Buick]]s (Electras) and [[Oldsmobile]]s (Ninety-Eights), with the question \"Is that a Cadillac?\" answered by the response \"No, it's an Oldsmobile...or Buick.\" At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line \"The Lincoln Town Car please.\" The commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising line for the brand, \"''Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.''\" which was used into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJSXyTnOhI|title=Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor 1988, the Lincoln Continental underwent a second redesign.  Splitting from the Mark VII, the Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln, as it became an extended-wheelbase version of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]; the 3.8L V6 engine also marked the first time in a Lincoln that no 8-cylinder (or V12) engine was offered.  In an effort to further reduce model overlap, the front-wheel drive Continental was developed for vehicles that neither Cadillac nor the Lincoln Town Car were marketed against: European and Japanese-produced luxury sedans.  Following the debut of a driver-side airbag in the [[Ford Tempo]], the 1989 Lincoln Continental became the first sedan sold in the United States equipped with standard [[Airbag|dual airbags]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Versailles, 1980.png|1980 Lincoln Versailles\nFile:82LincolnContinental.jpg|1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\nFile:1984 Lincoln Towncar.jpg|1984 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:Lincoln Continental (4282945959).jpg|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental\nFile:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1988\u20131991 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1989 Lincoln Town Car -- 06-16-2011.jpg|1989 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\n</gallery>\n\n==== Continental Mark VI and Mark VII ====\nFor 1980, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]] made its debut, replacing the Mark V.  Originally slated to adopt the Ford Thunderbird chassis as part of downsizing, the Mark VI remained a full-size car, adopting the Ford Panther platform.  Following the departure of Lee Iaccoca from Ford, the development of the Mark VI shifted from stand-alone model range to a four-door sedan and two-door coupe.  Following its marketplace success, many design elements of the Mark V were carried onto the Mark VI, including its sharp-edged sheetmetal, hidden headlamps, opera windows, and fender louvers (now non-functional).  The Mark VI coupe shared the same exact 114\u201d Ford/Mercury wheelbase of the Panther chassis, with its own distinct roofline, while the four-door Mark VI shared its body with the Lincoln Continental/Town Car-Town Coup\u00e9, on a 3\u201d longer wheelbase (at 117\u201d).\n\nThe Mark VI continued the use of the Designer Series (for coupes); in 1982, the option packages began a revision, as the Cartier Edition was moved to the Town Car and the Givenchy Edition was moved to the Continental. In early-1982, the Givenchy Edition was re-introduced to the Mark VI lineup, (via a single-page insert to the showroom brochure) but would last only that year. In another tradition, in 1980, the Mark VI launched the Signature Series trim level.  Initially intended as a direct replacement for the 1979 Collector's Series, the Signature Series designation would also be utilized by the Town Car beginning in 1981; in various forms, it would be used to its 2011 discontinuation...as well as the mid-size bustle-back Continental (for 1982 only). The heavily feature-equipped 1980\u20131981 Mark VI Signature Series (padded vinyl trunk lid tire bulge, color-keyed bumper guards and rub strips, color-keyed trunk carpeting, color-keyed turbine wheels, tool kit, etc.), received a de-contenting of many of these exclusive features for 1982-on, but now offered more colors and options. This ultimately became more of a parallel replacement of the former (1976\u20131981) \u201cLuxury Group\u201d offerings, which was absent from the option list for 1982-on.\n\nFor 1984, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] replaced the Mark VI, again becoming a counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].   The most technically advanced vehicle sold by Lincoln-Mercury at the time, the Mark VII represented a major market shift, becoming the smallest version of the Mark series.  From the 1979 Mark V to the 1984 Mark VII, Ford engineers shed 27 inches of length and over 1,200 pounds of curb weight.  While slightly less performance-oriented than a [[Grand tourer|grand-touring car]], in its development, the Mark VII placed a far greater emphasis on handling capability than any previous Mark-series vehicle, with four-wheel disc brakes, anti-lock brakes, four-wheel air suspension; its 5.0L V8 was shared with the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]].\n\nFor 1986, to eliminate the long-running nameplate confusion, the Continental Mark VII (marketed, sold and serviced by Lincoln) was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII, dropping the Continental nameplate.  The Mark VII would be the final generation of the Mark series sold with a Designer Series name, with a Bill Blass Edition being sold through its production (a Gianni Versace edition was sold from 1984 to 1985), eventually becoming the standard model.  As a sport-oriented model, Lincoln sold the Mark VII LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) from 1984 to 1992.\n<gallery>\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811333464).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811337194).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:Lincoln-Continental-Mark-VII.jpg|1984\u20131985 Continental Mark VII LSC \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhile Lincoln exited the struggles of the Malaise era by 1990, the division found itself in a different struggle.  While largely catching up to rival Cadillac in sales, the brand did so with only three model lines (in place of the seven of Cadillac and four of Mercedes-Benz).  After following the traditional Lincoln model cycle, the Town Car underwent a full redesign.  While mandated by both passive-restraint requirements and fuel-economy improvements, a redesign to the Town Car proved risky, as the model line itself accounted for over half of all Lincoln sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars14.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo meet federal requirements, Lincoln marked the debut of several safety features within Ford Motor Company and within the American luxury segment.  Following the 1989 debut of dual airbags in the Lincoln Continental (1990 in the Town Car), antilock brakes (ABS) made their return on the Continental (1988) and on the Town Car (1992).\n\nIn line with the Lincoln Mark VII, the exterior of the Lincoln Town Car shed many of its sharp-edged lines to allow for a far sleeker body design; other elements remained, including a formal rear roofline, chrome trim, radiator-style grille, and C-pillar quarter windows.  In line with the Lincoln Continental, the 1990 Town Car adopted dual airbags.  Delayed to 1991, the Lincoln Town Car marked the debut of the 210&nbsp;hp 4.6L [[Ford Modular engine|Ford Modular V8 engine]], the first overhead-cam eight-cylinder used in an American car since the [[Duesenberg Model J]].  Built on a revision of the Panther platform, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car shared its underpinnings (but no exterior panels) with the 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]] (dropping the LTD prefix) and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Mark VIII (see below), for 1995, the Lincoln Continental underwent a redesign, introducing a new version of the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]] chassis.  Retaining the use of front-wheel drive, to better compete with Japanese-produced luxury sedans, the Continental was equipped with a 4.6L V8 engine (shared with the Mark VIII, tuned for front-wheel drive).\n\n1998 marked a significant transition for the Lincoln model line.  The [[Lincoln Navigator]] (see below) made its debut as the first Lincoln SUV; the Mark VIII ended its production run (becoming the final Mark-series vehicle).  While the Continental underwent a mid-cycle update, the Town Car received an extensive redesign.  The tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the Mark VIII and the Continental with a completely redesigned interior.  Following the success of the Navigator in the marketplace, 1998 marked the first year Lincoln outsold Cadillac (by over 4,500 vehicles).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers|last=O'DELL|first=JOHN|date=1999-05-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>   \n<gallery>\nFile:90-92 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1990\u20131992 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:95-97 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:LTC Signature 1998-2002.png|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1994 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1995-1997 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\nFile:98-02 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Mark VIII ====\nAfter a nine-year production run (matching the Mark IV and Mark V combined), the Lincoln Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII, remaining a variant of the [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar]].  This was the first generation of the Mark series originally branded as a Lincoln. Further emphasis was placed on handling, with the Mark VIII (and Thunderbird/Cougar) becoming the only American-produced four-seat cars of the time with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel independent suspension.  While the Mark VIII adopted the coupe profile of its predecessor, in an effort to modernize its styling, much of the body was radically streamlined (relegating the spare-tire hump to vestigial status).  In massive contrast from its 1970s predecessors, the Mark VIII was given a cockpit-style interior, with all controls oriented towards the driver.  In various forms, elements of the Mark VIII would be featured in other Lincoln models (the 1995 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Town Car interior), and other Ford Motor Company products (the interior of the [[Ford Windstar]] minivan).\n\nWhile Designer Editions were discontinued, the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) made its return as the flagship Mark VIII model.  During the 1990s, the Mark VIII competed in the mid-size luxury coupe segment, which was in overall decline.  Though positively received by critics and buyers, the Mark VIII was withdrawn after the 1998 model year, outliving the Thunderbird and Cougar by a year.  As of the 2019 model year, the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII is currently the final version of Lincoln Mark series.\n<gallery>\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9674876061).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9678105220).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, front left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, rear left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Navigator ====\n[[File:1st Lincoln Navigator -- 07-11-2012.JPG|thumb|1998-2000 Lincoln Navigator]]\nFor 1998, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Navigator]] full-size SUV, its first new nameplate since the Versailles (outside of the Mark series).  While sharing no common bodywork forward of the windshield, the Navigator was a counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]; both model lines were  mechanically derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]].  Developed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover (P38A)|Range Rover]], [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]], and [[Toyota Land Cruiser#J80 (1990\u20132008)|Toyota Land Cruiser]]/[[Lexus LX|Lexus LX450]], the truck-based design offered increased cargo and towing capability (raised to 8,500 pounds in 1999) over its competitors.  The Navigator also offered standard third-row seating (offered only on the Land Cruiser/LX)\n\nTo distinguish its exterior from the Expedition, stylists adopted several design elements from the 1998 Town Car, including its use of body-color bumpers, chrome license-plate surround (the only chrome on the rear liftgate) and reduced use of chrome window trim (largely to distinguish it from the Expedition); the grille design would later be used on the 2000 Lincoln LS.\n\nIn an extended debut model year, the Navigator became the second-most popular Lincoln behind the Town Car, selling 71,000 examples.  In response, General Motors launched two full-size luxury SUVs marketed against the Navigator, both derived from the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]: the [[GMC Denali|GMC Yukon Denali]] and the [[Cadillac Escalade]]; both model lines introduced third-row seating in 2001.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAs the division entered the 21st century, Lincoln began a period of major transition.  In addition to ending production of the long-running Mark series, the Lincoln Navigator SUV had entered production, nearly unchallenged by European and Japanese manufacturers.  As buyers of mid-size coupes in the luxury segments had shifted towards sports sedans, Lincoln developed an entry for the segment in the place of the Mark VIII.  For 2000, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln LS]] mid-size sports sedan; coinciding with Premier Automotive Group (see below), the LS was developed alongside the [[Jaguar S-Type]].  Though the two vehicles shared a common chassis and related powertrain, no body panels were common between the two vehicles.  The shortest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the LS was developed to compete with European and Japanese-produced counterparts, in line with the [[Cadillac Catera]].  While the Catera was imported from Germany (as a rebadged Opel Omega), the LS was produced alongside the Town Car and Continental in Wixom Assembly.\n\nFor 2002, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first pickup truck produced by the brand and the first Lincoln manufactured outside of Michigan since 1958 (along with the Versailles).  Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the Blackwood was fitted with the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator and a model-specific pickup bed (with imitation wood exterior trim).  In line with its name, all examples were painted black.  The Lincoln Blackwood met with poor reception, due to its limited cargo capability (its pickup bed was effectively a carpeted trunk) and lack of four-wheel drive, leading Lincoln to discontinue the model after a single year of production.\n\n2003 marked a period of transition of the Lincoln model line, as both the Town Car and LS underwent mid-cycle updates (with the Town Car receiving a full chassis redesign), with Lincoln introducing the second generation of the Navigator.  As a complement to the Navigator, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Aviator]] mid-size SUV.  Sharing the body of the Ford Explorer with the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], the Aviator adopted many styling elements from the Navigator, with a nearly identical interior design.  While priced higher than its Mercury Mountaineer counterpart to avoid model overlap, the Aviator struggled to sell, as it competed closely against the Navigator sold in the same showroom.  After 52 years of production, the Continental was discontinued for 2003.\n\nFor 2005, Lincoln introduced a second pickup truck model line, the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].  Again based on the [[Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the design of the Mark LT was partially derived from the poor reception to the Lincoln Blackwood.  While still fitted with Lincoln Navigator bodywork and interior trim, the Mark LT was fitted with a standard pickup bed; all wheel drive was available as an option.  Following lower than expected sales, the Mark LT was withdrawn from the United States (in favor of Ford adding additional content to the Ford F-Series) in 2008; in Mexico (where the Mark LT was the highest-selling vehicle of the brand) Lincoln continued sales of the Mark LT through 2014.<ref name=\"MarkLT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|title=El poder es producto de la superacion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125056/http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|archivedate=January 6, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2006, The Way Forward restructuring plan (see below) began to take effect on Ford Motor Company, with the Lincoln LS ending production.  To replace the LS, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Zephyr for 2006.  In what would be the smallest Lincoln sedan ever, the Zephyr was derived from the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] mid-size sedan.  In an effort to distinguish itself from its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the Lincoln Zephyr adapted styling elements from Lincoln vehicles of the past, including a wide rectangular grille (1960s and 1970s Continentals), wraparound headlamps (late 1960s Continentals), and a twin-pod dashboard (early 1960s Continental).\n\nIn 2007, as another part of The Way Forward, Lincoln began a rebranding of its model line.  As Ford considered the Lincoln Mark series to have high nameplate recognition, Lincoln began to introduce similar \"MK\" branding across the model lineup.  For 2007, the Lincoln Zephyr was rebranded as the Lincoln MKZ (\"em-kay-zee\"), with the 2007 [[Lincoln MKX]] (\"em-kay-ex\") crossover SUV introduced.  Originally slated to become the second-generation Lincoln Aviator, the MKX was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]].  Alongside the Lincoln Town Car, the Lincoln Navigator was not included with the MK rebranding; for 2007, it was redesigned alongside the Ford Expedition, marking the debut of the extended-length Navigator L.  For the last time, a Designer Series Lincoln was produced, as Lincoln discontinued the trim on the Town Car after 2007.  Produced only as a concept car, the 2007 [[Lincoln MKR]] marked the debut of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|Ford EcoBoost V6]].\n\nFor 2009, Lincoln introduced its first all-new full-size sedan since 1980, the [[Lincoln MKS]].  Intended to be phased in as the replacement for the Lincoln Town Car, the MKS was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]].  Built on a Volvo-derived chassis, the MKS was the first full-size Lincoln with front-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive); shared with the Ford Taurus SHO, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 was an option.  Derived from the 2007 MKR concept, the MKS marked the production debut of the \"split-wing\" grille, a design element similar to the 1930s Lincoln Zephyr.  A year later, the division introduced the [[Lincoln MKT]] crossover SUV, a counterpart of the [[Ford Flex]].  Sharing its chassis with the MKS, the MKT was sized between the MKX and standard-wheelbase Navigator.<gallery>\nFile:2002 Lincoln Blackwood 1.jpg|2002 Lincoln Blackwood\nFile:Lincoln Town Car Signature.JPG|2003\u20132007 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|2004 Lincoln LS\nFile:LincolnAviator.jpg|2003-2005 Lincoln Aviator\nFile:Navigator L.jpg|2007 Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2009 Lincoln MKZ.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln MKS -- 01-13-2010.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKS\n</gallery>\n\n==== Premier Automotive Group & The Way Forward ====\nAs Lincoln entered the 21st century, the brand underwent a major transition within the structure of Ford Motor Company.  As Ford expanded its global automotive holdings during the 1980s and 1990s, it acquired Jaguar, Aston Martin, Land Rover, and Volvo Cars.  To collectively manage its global luxury-vehicle holdings, in 1999, Ford organized Premier Automotive Group (PAG).  The same year, the management of Lincoln-Mercury was shifted to the American headquarters of PAG, largely in an effort to engineer and market more competitive vehicles for the brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars19.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe integration of Lincoln into PAG would lead to several product changes within the division.  Following the 2000 debut of the LS sports sedan, the Lincoln Continental was withdrawn in 2002.  To avoid the model overlap that plagued the division two decades before, Lincoln chose to focus production on the Lincoln Town Car, one of the highest-profit vehicles of Ford Motor Company. During 2002, as part of a change of management, Lincoln-Mercury was removed from PAG and relocated within Ford Motor Company headquarters.\n\nIn 2005, Ford developed [[The Way Forward]] restructuring plan in an effort to return to profitability.  Among the seven vehicle assembly facilities slated for closure, Wixom Assembly (home to all Lincoln assembly since 1957, with the exception of the Versailles, Navigator, Blackwood, and Mark LT) was placed third, with an announced June 2007 closure.  After a shortened 2006 model year, the Lincoln LS ended production.  Initially slated for discontinuation after 2007, production of the Lincoln Town Car was shifted to [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Ontario, consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.  In 2011, all three vehicles ended production, coinciding with the closure of that facility.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFor the Lincoln division, the beginning of the 2010s introduced a number of structural changes.  While Lincoln and Mercury were spared by The Way Forward, in 2010, Ford announced the closure of Mercury at the end of the year, with the final Mercury vehicle produced on January 4, 2011.       After 30 years of production as a distinct model line (and 41 years as a Lincoln nameplate), the Lincoln Town Car ended its production run in 2011, coinciding with the closure of St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario.  In contrast to the V8-engined Lincoln Town Car, for 2011, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln MKZ#MKZ Hybrid (2011)|MKZ Hybrid]], a counterpart of the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]].  The first Lincoln hybrid vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid was the first Lincoln equipped with a four-cylinder engine.  Following the discontinuation of the Town Car sedan, Lincoln continued use of the Town Car nameplate, adding it to limousine and livery variants of the Lincoln MKT.  Along with chassis modifications for heavy-duty use, the MKT Town Car features modified rear seating, with the third-row seat removed to create additional luggage space and second-row seat legroom.\n\nTo reflect the end of the Lincoln-Mercury division pairing (from 1945 to 2010), in December 2012, the formal name of Lincoln was changed to The Lincoln Motor Company (its name prior to 1940).<ref name=\"lincoln20122\">{{cite press release|title=Lincoln Forges Dynamic New Path with the Introduction of 'The Lincoln Motor Company' and All-New MKZ Luxury Vehicle|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|quote=The company, introduced as The Lincoln Motor Company, unveiled its all-new MKZ midsize luxury sedan and a strategic plan to reinvent the premium automotive marketplace|access-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206011208/http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>  To help differentiate Lincoln vehicles from Ford counterparts, Ford established separate design, product development, and sales teams for Lincoln.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/automobiles/lincoln-strategy-well-try-anything.html|title=Lincoln Strategy: We\u2019ll Try Anything|last=Dyer|first=Ezra|date=December 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>   In a marketing shift, Lincoln began to target \"progressive luxury customers\". luxury buyers seeking a vehicle solely for their own interests and avoiding ostentation altogether.<ref name=\"valdes2\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|title=Ford Restarts Lincoln Motor Co.|last=Dapena-Valdes|first=Peter|date=December 3, 2012|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203182033/http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|archive-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|publisher=[[CNN]]|quote=As it attempts to revive a once-great luxury brand, Ford's is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co., the automaker said Monday.}}</ref><ref name=\"lincoln20122\" />\n\nAs part of the 2012 rebranding, for 2013, the Lincoln model line underwent several design revisions, headed by the release of the second-generation MKZ.  Retaining commonality with the Ford Fusion (a rebadged [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Ford Mondeo]]), the MKZ adapted a distinct exterior from its Fusion/Mondeo counterparts (nearly unchanged from a Lincoln concept car released in 2012).<ref name=\"valdes2\" />  The MKS and MKT underwent exterior and interior revisions, adopting the \"bow-wing\" grille design of the MKZ.  Also during this time, Lincoln introduced new trim level nomenclatures Premiere, Select and Reserve on the MKZ.  Use of these trim names would eventually be expanded to other Lincoln models.  \n\nSince 2014, Lincoln has enlisted [[Matthew McConaughey]] as a brand spokesman; McConaughey has appeared in commercials for several Lincoln products in the past six years. \n\nFor 2015, Lincoln introduced two new SUVs, with the all-new [[Lincoln MKC]] compact crossover SUV (derived from the [[Ford Kuga]]/Ford Escape) becoming the first Lincoln produced solely with four-cylinder engines.  The Lincoln Navigator underwent an extensive revision, largely to preview buyers of its 2018 redesign.  Along with extensive exterior and interior updates, the Navigator adopted the 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 of the Ford F-150 as its standard engine, becoming the first version of the Navigator offered without a V8 engine.\n\nFollowing the positive reception to a 2015 concept car of the same name, Lincoln revived the Lincoln Continental nameplate for the 2017 model year (after a 15-year hiatus).  Slotted as a replacement for the Lincoln MKS, the Continental was adapted from a version of the Ford Taurus designed for China.  While slightly shorter than the MKS, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln since the Town Car.  The revived model line introduced a new design language for Lincoln; shifting away from the split-wing grille, the Continental introduced a recessed rectangular grille.  The revived Continental marked the debut of the Lincoln \"Black Label\" program for all Lincoln vehicles.  As a flagship trim line, Black Label vehicles feature specially coordinated exterior and interior design themes (similar to the Designer Editions of the Mark series), along with highly personalized customer service.\n\nFor 2018, after an eleven-year production run of its predecessor, Lincoln released the fourth generation of the Navigator.  Integrating the recessed rectangular grille of the Continental into its exterior, the Navigator is distinguished from the Ford Expedition largely from its taillamps and its blacked-out roof pillars (sharing the \"floating roof\" design of the Ford Flex and Ford Explorer).  At a base price of $95,000, the Lincoln Navigator L Black Label is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]] supercars).  The Lincoln MKZ underwent a mid-cycle redesign, adopting the grille design and twin-turbocharged V6 engine of the Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor 2019, the retirement of the \"MK\" naming scheme was expanded, as the MKX underwent a mid-cycle update, becoming the [[Lincoln Nautilus]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-lincoln-nautilus-first-look-review-mkx-replacement-gets-new-name/|title=2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Look: MKX Replacement Gets New Name|date=2017-11-28|magazine=Motor Trend}}</ref>  To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate, Lincoln unveiled the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition, marking the debut of a long-wheelbase Lincoln Continental.  The first factory produced Lincoln sold with a base price over $100,000, the variant marked the revival of the rear-hinged door configuration (after a 40-year absence).  The MKT (including the MKT Town Car livery version) was discontinued in 2019, marking the final use of the Town Car nameplate.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2011 Lincoln MKX -- 03-09-2011 1.jpg|2011 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2013 Lincoln Mk T Town Car NYC.JPG|2013 Lincoln MKT Town Car\nFile:Lincoln MKC 01 China 2015-04-10.jpg|2015 Lincoln MKC\nFile:Lincoln MKX II 01 China 2016-04-18.jpg|2016 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|2017 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln Continental P4220637.jpg|2018 Lincoln Continental\nFile:2018 Lincoln Navigator front 9.22.18.jpg|2018 Lincoln Navigator L Black Label\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2020s ===\nFor 2020, the Lincoln model line underwent further expansion, with the return of the Aviator mid-size SUV (again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer); the revived Aviator offers the first hybrid-electric system in a Lincoln SUV.  The long-wheelbase coach-door Continental is now offered as a regular production model in Black Label trim.  The MKC was replaced by the [[Lincoln Corsair]], remaining a counterpart of the Ford Escape/Kuga.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2020 Lincoln Aviator Black Label in Chroma Caviar Dark Grey, front left.jpg|Lincoln Aviator Black Label\nFile:2020 Lincoln Corsair 'Signature' 2.0L Ecoboost, front 2.20.20.jpg|Lincoln Corsair\nFile:2019 Lincoln Nautilus \"Reserve\" 2.7L front 4.22.19.jpg|Lincoln Nautilus Reserve\nFile:2019 Lincoln Navigator L 3.5, front 8.23.19.jpg|Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2019 Lincoln Continental \"Select\", front 10.29.19.jpg|Lincoln Continental\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|Lincoln MKZ\n</gallery>\n\n== Worldwide distribution ==\n\n=== Asia ===\nLincoln vehicles are available in South Korea; most of the product line is sold but the Lincoln Navigator has not been introduced to the country.

Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush.  Along with producing the first purpose-built presidential limousine, Lincoln produced two of the first armored vehicles for presidential use.\n\nA 1939 Lincoln Model K V12 convertible (with a Brunn body) was acquired by the government for the use of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  As a result of its convertible top (to allow the president to appear in crowds without exiting the vehicle), the Lincoln adapted the name \"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\".  In 1942, as a response to the beginning of World War II, the Sunshine Special adapted armor plating and bullet-proof glass; the retractable roof remained in use.  Following the result of the security upgrades, the Sunshine Special expanded to 9,300 pounds.  After traveling across the United States for the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the Sunshine Special was retired in 1948.  Today, the Sunshine Special is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].\n\nAs a replacement for the Sunshine Special, in 1950, the White House leased 10 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitans (9 sedans and one convertible), bodied by [[Henney Motor Company]] with security upgrades from Hess & Eisenhardt.  For 1954, President Eisenhower ordered a removable [[Plexiglas]] roof fitted to the 20-foot-long Cosmopolitan convertible, with the vehicle adapting the \"Bubble Top\" nickname.  Along with the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, Lincoln Cosmopolitans would see use by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once), with the \"Bubble Top\" retired in 1965.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy began use of a modified 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, bodied by [[Hess & Eisenhardt]] of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Code-named [[SS-100-X]], the Lincoln was an open car, designed with a set of interchangeable tops, including a black formal-profile top, plexiglass roof sections and a stainless-steel [[targa top]] for the driver's compartment.  In presidential parades and motorcades, the limousine was often used as an open car (to avoid stress on the cooling system).  In the open configuration, John F. Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in November 1963.  Following the Kennedy assassination, SS-100X was initially investigated for evidence; in early 1964, the vehicle was released to Hess & Eisenhardt, effectively becoming remanufactured.  Distinguished by a shift from navy blue to black paint and the permanent fitment of a roof, SS-100X underwent extensive security modifications, adding armor plating and bulletproof glass.  Retired from front-line service in 1967, the 1961 limousine remained in service until 1977, used by Presidents Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter.  SS-100X is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, along with the Sunshine Special.\n\nDuring the 1960s, alongside SS-100X, the Johnson administration used several Lincolns: including three 1965 Lincoln Continental Executive limousines (two used by the President; one was used by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]) and a 1968 Lincoln stretch limousine, the latter is on display at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nFor the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, the White House commissioned a state limousine based upon a 1969 Lincoln Continental, bodied by Lehman-Peterson of Chicago, Illinois.  While again adopting the armor plating and bulletproof glass and other security features of SS-100X, to allow the President to stand upright and greet constituents from the motorcade, a sunroof was added to the vehicle above the rear passenger compartment.  Used by President Nixon until 1974, the car is located at the [[Nixon Library]] in Yorba Linda, California.\n\nDeveloped for the second term of the Nixon administration, in 1974, the [[Gerald Ford]] administration replaced the 1969 Continental with an armored 1972 Lincoln Continental limousine.  As a result of armor plating and security upgrades, the 1972 Continental was stretched to 22 feet in length, weighing nearly 13,000 pounds.  Used by Gerald Ford, [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]], the 1972 Continental has notoriety similar to the SS-100X, with its presence at two presidential assassination attempts.  In 1975, the limousine rushed Gerald Ford away during the [[Sara Jane Moore#Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford|assassination attempt against him from Sarah Jane Moore]].  In 1981, Ronald Reagan was wounded in [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]'s [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]].  While not directly hit by a bullet from Hinckley, Reagan was wounded by a bullet that had struck the armor plating on the side of the car, richocheting off of the vehicle.  Today, the car is on display at the Henry Ford Museum alongside the Sunshine Special and SS-100-X.\n\nThe last Lincoln used as a [[Presidential state car]] is a 1989 Lincoln Town Car commissioned for [[George H. W. Bush]].  In line with its 1983 [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] predecessor, the roofline of the Town Car was raised several inches to accommodate for the thickness of bulletproof glass (while preserving outward visibility).  To better handle the weight of armor plating and security upgrades, the powertrain was upgraded to that of an F-250 pickup truck, receiving a 7.5L V8 and a [[Ford C6 transmission#E4OD|E4OD]] 4-speed automatic transmission.  Today, the car is on display at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in College Station, Texas.  Since 1993, the Secret Service has used limousines derived from Cadillac vehicles as a presidential state car.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1939 Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Sunshine Special (31609480232).jpg|\"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\", 1939 Lincoln Model K convertible/Brunn body\nFile:Inaugural Parade.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown.<ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals.<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station).<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref> But it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard).

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck bulk delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by numerous skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, with plans to redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nBy this time a deep per-longed recession had taken hold in the province which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled outright. There was limited market demand for new office space one of the key requirements to acquiring bank loans. The resulting financing difficulties resulted in the building's ownership being reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 with the structure remaining unused & abandoned. The Toronto Raptors owners purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, and open lots at Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas Eaton Centre lands were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was demolished to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999.<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>  The intergartion of the Maple Leafs into the new structure would result in a 25% increase in construction costs (over $25 million CAD in 1999).<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>\n\nThe completed structure included a 15-storey tower (reduced from a proposed 30-stories), four restaurants, and an underground parking lot. \n\n====Opening====\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.  The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown.<ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals.<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station).<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref> But it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard).

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck bulk delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by numerous skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, with plans to redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nBy this time a deep per-longed recession had taken hold in the province which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled outright. There was limited market demand for new office space one of the key requirements to acquiring bank loans. The resulting financing difficulties resulted in the building's ownership being reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 with the structure remaining unused & abandoned. The Toronto Raptors owners purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999.<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>  The intergartion of the Maple Leafs into the new structure would result in a 25% increase in construction costs (over $25 million CAD in 1999).<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>\n\nThe completed structure included a 15-storey tower (reduced from a proposed 30-stories), four restaurants, and an underground parking lot. \n\n====Opening====\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.
