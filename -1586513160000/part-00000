The commission reported a number of findings, including: \n* The conflict and post-independence period preceding it represent the most shameful years of Sierra Leone\u2019s history. This conflict reflects an extraordinary failure of leadership individuals amongst the government, society, and public.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption, and nepotism that deprived the nation of its dignity and reduced its citizens to a state of poverty.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Government accountability was non-existent, and the institution designed to uphold human rights was co-opted by the executive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Both sides of the conflict specifically targeted civilians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The Sierra Leone civil war was characterized by indiscriminate violence. It broke long-standing rules, defiled cherished traditions, sullied human respect and tore apart the very fabric of society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Children aged between ten and 14 years were especially targeted for forced recruitment. Girls between the ages of ten and 14 were targeted for rape and for abuse as sexual slaves. These women were also tortured and suffered cruel and inhumane acts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The leadership of the Revolutionary United Front and the Government of Sierra Leone are responsible for either authorising or instigating human rights violations against civilians. They also stand accused of failing to stop such atrocities, and for failing to acknowledge the occurrence of these atrocities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Contrary to popular belief, the exploitation of diamonds did not cause the conflict in Sierra Leone. However, various factions targeted diamondiferous areas in order to gain wealth to support their war efforts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The [[right to the truth]] is inalienable. This right should be upheld in terms of national and international law. It is the reaching of the wider truth through broad-based participation that permits a nation to examine itself honestly and to take effective measures to prevent a repetition of the past.<ref name=\":0\" />\nFor a complete list of the Truth Commission's findings, see chapter 2 of the full report, available [http://www.sierra-leone.org/Other-Conflict/TRCVolume2.pdf here].\n\n== Reparations ==\nThe [[Reparations (transitional justice)|Reparations]] section of the Truth Commission is aimed at creating a [[Reparative justice|reparations program]] for the victims of the Sierra Leonean conflict. Such a program is difficult to create as there are a number of victims on both sides of the conflict, as well as a number of different crimes committed by both sides. Because of this, the Commission had to determine who would benefit from a reparations program.<blockquote>In designing a reparations programme for the victims of the Sierra Leonean conflict, the Commission had to take into account a number of factors. It would have been gratifying if all victims of the conflict could benefit from a reparations programme but such a programme would be totally impossible for the country to implement. The Commission therefore had to determine who would benefit from a reparations programme. The Commission determined the category of beneficiaries by considering those victims who were particularly vulnerable because of the human rights violations they had suffered and the harm that they continued to live with.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>It is important to note that the TRC Act did not explicitly use the term \"reparations\". Instead, they were instructed to \"address the needs of the victims,\" and restore the human dignity of victims\" as well as \"promote healing and reconciliation.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Recommendations ==\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act of 2000 requires any commission to make recommendations concerning the reforms and measures needed to achieve the object of the commission. These recommendations are crucial in order to promote the healing process for the nation after the conflict. In the case of the Sierra Leone commission, the reparations are aimed at the \"building of a new Sierra Leone based on the values of human dignity, tolerance and respect for the rights of all persons.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The main recommendations of the commission were: \n* The commission found that due to a lack of visionary leadership, there was no one to steer the country away from its slide into chaos and civil war. Because of this, the commission called on leaders from all levels of Sierra Leonean society to commit themselves to employing better forms of leadership.\n* The central cause of the war was endemic greed, corruption and nepotism, which deprived the nation of its dignity and forced its citizens into poverty. The commission calls upon all members in the private sector to work together and usher in a new culture of ethics and to fight the \"scourge of corruption which saps the life-force of Sierra Leone.\"\n* The commission also recommended the implementation of a more modern human rights culture in which all \"Sierra Leoneans respect each other's human rights, without exception.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, the creation of a new constitution was also recommended. In the commission's words: \"A Sierra Leone that is united around clear constitutional rights, values and principles has a promising future.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Due to a severe lack of governmental accountability, democracy and the rule of law had ceased to exist. Therefore, the commission recommended that Sierra Leone must strengthen its institutions of accountability.\nFor a complete list of the commission's recommendations, see Chapter 2 of the full report, available [http://www.sierra-leone.org/Other-Conflict/TRCVolume2.pdf here].\n\n== Criticisms ==\nIn her book ''Unspeakable Truths: Facing the Challenge of Truth Commissions,'' [[Priscilla Hayner|Priscilla B. Hayner]] examines various truth commissions, one of which is the commission for Sierra Leone. One of her main criticisms of the report was the government's inability to enact many of the commission's recommendations. The \"government was required to submit public quarterly reports on the actions it had taken to fulfill the recommendations.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The government made slow but eventual progress in the implementation of the commission's recommendations.\n\nHayner also points out a common criticism facing many truth commissions; the need for \"social forgetting\". Many citizens in Sierra Leone felt that social forgetting was crucial to the process of healing and reconciliation. Unfortunately, many citizens were not able to simply forget, as they were pressured into making official statements to the commission regarding their experiences during the Civil War.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''Witness to Truth: Report of the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission''.

The orchestra is named after the concert hall in which it is based, the [[Gewandhaus]] (\"Garment House\").  In addition to its concert duties, the orchestra also performs frequently in the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|Thomaskirche]] and as the official opera orchestra of the [[Oper Leipzig|Leipzig Opera]].\n\n==History==\nThe orchestra's origins can be traced to 1743, when a society called the ''Grosses Concert'' began performing in private homes. In 1744 the ''Grosses Concert'' moved its concerts to the \"Three Swans\" Tavern. Their concerts continued at this venue for 36 years, until 1781. In 1780, because of complaints about concert conditions and audience behavior in the tavern, the mayor and city council of Leipzig offered to renovate one story of the Gewandhaus (the building used by textile merchants) for the orchestra's use. The motto ''Res severa est verum gaudium'' (\"only a serious thing is a true joy\", or \"true joy is a serious thing\" \u2013 from the Roman author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]) was painted in the hall, suggesting the priorities of the sponsors. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. The orchestra thus has a good claim to being the oldest continuing orchestra in Germany founded by the [[bourgeoisie]], while older orchestras were part of royal suites.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 March 2018 |title=Gewandhausorchester Leipzig wird 275 Jahre alt |url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/boulevard_nt/article174365569/Gewandhausorchester-Leipzig-wird-275-Jahre-alt.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |location=Berlin |language=de |access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] became the orchestra's [[music director]], with the traditional title of ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'', and held the post until his death in 1847. Several other musicians shared the duties with Mendelssohn during his tenure, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], and [[Niels Gade]].  In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall. This was destroyed by bombing in 1944. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name. It was opened in 1981. The large organ in the hall bears the original Gewandhaus hall's motto \"''Res severa verum gaudium''\" .\n\nLater principal [[Conducting|conductor]]s included [[Arthur Nikisch]], [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[V\u00e1clav Neumann]].  From 1970 to 1996, [[Kurt Masur]] was ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'', and he and the orchestra made a number of recordings for the Philips label. From 1998 to 2005, [[Herbert Blomstedt]] held the same position, and they in turn made several recordings for the Decca label.  Blomstedt currently holds the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra, while Masur held the post jointly with Blomstedt until his death in 2015.\n\nIn 2005, [[Riccardo Chailly]] took over as both ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'' and music director of the Leipzig Opera, with an initial contract through 2010.  In 2008, Chailly's first contract extension occurred, through 2015.  However, he concurrently resigned as GMD of the Oper Leipzig, reportedly after conflict over the hiring of personnel without his consultation.<ref>\"Riccardo Chailly will Leipziger Oper verlassen\" {{in lang|de}}.

Orchestra''' (''Gewandhausorchester''; also previously known in German as the ''Gewandhausorchester Leipzig'') is a German symphony orchestra based in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]].  The orchestra is named after the concert hall in which it is based, the [[Gewandhaus]] (\"Garment House\").  In addition to its concert duties, the orchestra also performs frequently in the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|Thomaskirche]] and as the official opera orchestra of the [[Oper Leipzig|Leipzig Opera]].\n\n==History==\nThe orchestra's origins can be traced to 1743, when a society called the ''Grosses Concert'' began performing in private homes. In 1744 the ''Grosses Concert'' moved its concerts to the \"Three Swans\" Tavern. Their concerts continued at this venue for 36 years, until 1781. In 1780, because of complaints about concert conditions and audience behavior in the tavern, the mayor and city council of Leipzig offered to renovate one story of the Gewandhaus (the building used by textile merchants) for the orchestra's use. The motto ''Res severa est verum gaudium'' (\"only a serious thing is a true joy\", or \"true joy is a serious thing\" \u2013 from the Roman author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]) was painted in the hall, suggesting the priorities of the sponsors. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. The orchestra thus has a good claim to being the oldest continuing orchestra in Germany founded by the [[bourgeoisie]], while older orchestras were part of royal suites.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 March 2018 |title=Gewandhausorchester Leipzig wird 275 Jahre alt |url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/boulevard_nt/article174365569/Gewandhausorchester-Leipzig-wird-275-Jahre-alt.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |location=Berlin |language=de |access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1835, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] became the orchestra's [[music director]], with the traditional title of ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'', and held the post until his death in 1847. Several other musicians shared the duties with Mendelssohn during his tenure, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], and [[Niels Gade]].  In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall. This was destroyed by bombing in 1944. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name. It was opened in 1981. The large organ in the hall bears the original Gewandhaus hall's motto \"''Res severa verum gaudium''\" .\n\nLater principal [[Conducting|conductor]]s included [[Arthur Nikisch]], [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]], [[Bruno Walter]], and [[V\u00e1clav Neumann]].  From 1970 to 1996, [[Kurt Masur]] was ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'', and he and the orchestra made a number of recordings for the Philips label. From 1998 to 2005, [[Herbert Blomstedt]] held the same position, and they in turn made several recordings for the Decca label.  Blomstedt currently holds the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra, while Masur held the post jointly with Blomstedt until his death in 2015.\n\nIn 2005, [[Riccardo Chailly]] took over as both ''Gewandhauskapellmeister'' and music director of the Leipzig Opera, with an initial contract through 2010.  In 2008, Chailly's first contract extension occurred, through 2015.  However, he concurrently resigned as GMD of the Oper Leipzig, reportedly after conflict over the hiring of personnel without his consultation.<ref>\"Riccardo Chailly will Leipziger Oper verlassen\" {{in lang|de}}.
