When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town. The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring [[Dir'iyyah]], where he joined forces with the [[Al Saud]]. The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the [[Saudis]] and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and [[Diriyyah]] in an effort to stop Saudi expansion. Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed the Al 'Ura'yir in 1793. In the early 1950s many Al Arabi people originating from Iraq migrated to Saudi Arabia Al Qassim\n\n===Return and Fall from Power===\nWhen the [[Ottomans]] invaded Arabia and overthrew the [[Al Saud]] in 1818, they conquered al-Hasa, al-Qatif and reinstated members of the Al 'Uray'ir as rulers of the region. The Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the [['Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], the [[Dawasir]], [[Subay']] and [[Mutayr]] began encroaching on the Bani Khalid's desert territories. They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership. Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the [['Anizzah]] tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with the [[Al Saud]], who had reestablished their rule in [[Riyadh]] in 1823. A battle with an alliance led by the [[Mutayr]] and [[Ajman (tribe)|'Ajman]] tribes in 1823,<ref>Meglio</ref> and another battle with the [[Subay']] and the [[Al Saud]] in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close. The Ottomans appointed a governor from Bani Khalid over al-Hasa once more in 1874, but his rule also was short-lived.<ref>Al-Rasheed, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Present==\nMany clans and sections of the Bani Khalid had already settled in al-Hasa and Nejd by this time, but many of those who remained leaving east Arabia after their military defeats against [[Ibn saud]], eventually settled in [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]].

When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town. The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring [[Dir'iyyah]], where he joined forces with the [[Al Saud]]. The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the [[Saudis]] and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and [[Diriyyah]] in an effort to stop Saudi expansion. Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed the Al 'Ura'yir in 1793. In the early 1950s many Al Arabi people originating from Iraq migrated to Saudi Arabia Al Qassim\n\n===Return and Fall from Power===\nWhen the [[Ottomans]] invaded Arabia and overthrew the [[Al Saud]] in 1818, they conquered al-Hasa, al-Qatif and reinstated members of the Al 'Uray'ir as rulers of the region. The Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the [['Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], the [[Dawasir]], [[Subay']] and [[Mutayr]] began encroaching on the Bani Khalid's desert territories. They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership. Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the [['Anizzah]] tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with the [[Al Saud]], who had reestablished their rule in [[Riyadh]] in 1823. A battle with an alliance led by the [[Mutayr]] and [[Ajman (tribe)|'Ajman]] tribes in 1823,<ref>Meglio</ref> and another battle with the [[Subay']] and the [[Al Saud]] in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close. The Ottomans appointed a governor from Bani Khalid over al-Hasa once more in 1874, but his rule also was short-lived.<ref>Al-Rasheed, p. 36</ref>\n\n==Present==\nMany clans and sections of the Bani Khalid had already settled in al-Hasa and Nejd by this time, but many of those who remained leaving east Arabia after their military defeats against [[Ibn saud]], eventually settled in [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]]. The clan today consists of important rulers{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}, and members of government.

This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration.\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nAbsorption:  Oral:  50%\n\nProtein binding:  15%\n\nMetabolism:  ''N''-oxide is the principal metabolite.\n\nHalf-life elimination:  With normal renal function, ranitidine taken orally has a half-life of 2.5\u20133.0 hours.  If taken intravenously, the half-life is generally 2.0\u20132.5 hours in a patient with normal [[creatinine]] clearance.\n\nExcretion:  The primary route of excretion is the urine.  In addition, about 30% of the orally administered dose is collected in the urine as non-absorbed drug in 24 hours.\n\n====Elderly====\nIn the elderly population, the plasma half-life of ranitidine is prolonged to 3\u20134 hours secondary to decreased kidney function causing decreased [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]].<ref name=\"ZANTAC Drug Insert\"/>\n\n====Children====\nIn general, studies of pediatric patients (aged one month to 16 years) have shown no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values in comparison to healthy adults, when correction is made for body weight.<ref name=\"ZANTAC Drug Insert\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Zantac.jpg|thumb|Zantac 300&nbsp;mg tablets from [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK)]]\nRanitidine was first prepared in [[England]] as AH19065 by John Bradshaw in the summer of [[1977 in the United Kingdom|1977]] in the [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] research laboratories of [[Allen & Hanburys]], part of the larger [[Glaxo]] organisation.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Lednicer|editor-first=Daniel|title=Chronicles of Drug Discovery|series=ACS Professional Reference Book|volume=3|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8412-2733-0|pages=45\u201381|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=4128658|status=patent|title=Aminoalkyl furan derivatives}}</ref>  Its development was a response to the first in class histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist, [[cimetidine]], developed by [[Sir James Black]] at [[Smith, Kline and French]], and launched in the United Kingdom as '''Tagamet''' in November [[1976 in the United Kingdom|1976]].  Both companies would eventually become merged as [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK), following a sequence of mergers and acquisitions, starting with the integration of Allen & Hanbury's Ltd and Glaxo to form Glaxo Group Research in [[1979 in the United Kingdom|1979]], and ultimately with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in [[2000 in the United Kingdom|2000]].  Ranitidine was the result of a [[Drug design#Rational drug design|rational drug-design]] process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor and [[QSAR|quantitative structure-activity relationships]] (QSAR).\n\nGlaxo refined the model further, by replacing the [[imidazole]] ring of cimetidine with a [[furan]] ring with a [[nitrogen]]-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine.  Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer [[adverse drug reaction]]s), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine.  Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to [[CYP450]], so it causes fewer side effects, but other H<sub>2</sub> blockers [[famotidine]] and [[nizatidine]] have no CYP450 significant interactions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics|author1=Laurence Brunton|author2=John Lazo|author3=Keith Parker|page=972|edition=11|date=August 2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-142280-2|doi=10.1036/0071422803|url=http://mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071422803|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411074421/http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071422803|archive-date=11 April 2016|df= |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n\nRanitidine was introduced in 1981, and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  Subsequently, it was largely superseded by the more effective [[proton-pump inhibitor]] (PPI) class of drugs, with [[omeprazole]] becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  When omeprazole and ranitidine were compared in a study of 144 people with severe inflammation and erosions or ulcers of the oesophagus, 85% of those treated with omeprazole healed within eight weeks, compared with 50% of those given ranitidine.

Ranitidine was the result of a [[Drug design#Rational drug design|rational drug-design]] process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor and [[QSAR|quantitative structure-activity relationships]] (QSAR).\n\nGlaxo refined the model further, by replacing the [[imidazole]] ring of cimetidine with a [[furan]] ring with a [[nitrogen]]-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine.  Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer [[adverse drug reaction]]s), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine.  Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to [[CYP450]], so it causes fewer side effects, but other H<sub>2</sub> blockers [[famotidine]] and [[nizatidine]] have no CYP450 significant interactions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics|author1=Laurence Brunton|author2=John Lazo|author3=Keith Parker|page=972|edition=11|date=August 2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-142280-2|doi=10.1036/0071422803|url=http://mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071422803|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411074421/http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071422803|archive-date=11 April 2016|df= |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n\nRanitidine was introduced in 1981, and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  Subsequently, it was largely superseded by the more effective [[proton-pump inhibitor]] (PPI) class of drugs, with [[omeprazole]] becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  When omeprazole and ranitidine were compared in a study of 144 people with severe inflammation and erosions or ulcers of the oesophagus, 85% of those treated with omeprazole healed within eight weeks, compared with 50% of those given ranitidine.

However, the lack of large-scale incision on the interfluve demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene [....] The present Ghaggar-Hakra valley and its tributary rivers are currently dry or have seasonal flows. Yet rivers were undoubtedly active in this region during the Urban Harappan Phase. We recovered sandy fluvial deposits approximately 5;400 y old at Fort Abbas in Pakistan (SI Text), and recent work (33) on the upper Ghaggar-Hakra interfluve in India also documented Holocene channel sands that are approximately 4;300 y old. On the upper interfluve, fine-grained floodplain deposition continued until the end of the Late Harappan Phase, as recent as 2,900 y ago (33) (Fig. 2B).

In some hymns, the Indus river seems to be more important than the Sarasavati, especially in the [[Nadistuti sukta]]. In RV 8.26.18, the white flowing Sindhu 'with golden wheels' is the most conveying or attractive of the rivers.\n* [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95.2. and other verses (e.g. [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].21.18) speak of the Sarasvati pouring \"milk and [[ghee]].\" Rivers are often likened to cows in the Rigveda, for example in [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].33.1,\n: ''\"Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling,''\n: ''[[Vipas]] and [[Sutudri]] speed down their waters.\"''\n* Rigveda,4.58.1 says \n:''\"May purifying Sarasvati with all the plenitude of her forms of plenty, rich in substance by the thought, desire our sacrifice.\"''\n:''\"She, the impeller to happy truths, the awakener in consciousness to right mentalisings, Sarasvati, upholds the sacrifice.\"''\n:''\"Sarasvati by the perception awakens in consciousness the great flood (the vast movement of the ritam) and illumines entirely all the thoughts\"''<ref>translation by Sri Aurobindo, op.cit.</ref>\n\n==== As a goddess ====\n[[File:Saraswati.jpg|thumb|Painting of Goddess Saraswati by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n{{main|Saraswati}}\n\nThe Sarasvati is mentioned some fifty times in the hymns of the Rig Veda.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  It is mentioned in thirteen hymns of the late books (1 and 10) of the Rigveda.<ref>1.3, 13, 89, 164; 10.17, 30, 64, 65, 66, 75, 110, 131, 141</ref> Only two of these references are unambiguously to the river: 10.64.9, calling for the aid of three  \"great rivers\", Sindhu, Sarasvati and [[Sarayu]]; and 10.75.5, the geographical list of the Nadistuti sukta. The others invoke Sarasvati as a goddess without direct connection to a specific river.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 10.30.12, her origin as a river goddess may explain her invocation as a protective deity in a hymn to the celestial waters. In 10.135.5, as Indra drinks [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] he is described as refreshed by Sarasvati. The invocations in 10.17 address Sarasvati as a goddess of the forefathers as well as of the present generation. In 1.13, 1.89, 10.85, 10.66 and 10.141, she is listed with other gods and goddesses, not with rivers. In 10.65, she is invoked together with \"holy thoughts\" (''{{IAST|dh\u012b}}'') and \"munificence\" (''{{IAST|pura\u1e43dhi}}''), consistent with her role as a goddess of both knowledge and fertility.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThough Sarasvati initially emerged as a river goddess in the Vedic scriptures, in later Hinduism of the [[Purana]]s, she was rarely associated with the river. Instead she emerged as an independent goddess of knowledge, learning, wisdom, music and the arts. The evolution of the river goddess into the goddess of knowledge started with later [[Brahmanas]], which identified her as ''V\u0101gdev\u012b'', the goddess of speech, perhaps due to the centrality of speech in the Vedic cult and the development of the cult on the banks of the river.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} It is also possible to postulate two originally independent goddesses that were fused into one in later Vedic times.{{sfn|Kinsley|1998|p=10, 55-57}} [[Aurobindo]] has proposed, on the other hand, that \"the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati ... She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration&nbsp;...\".<ref>K.R. Jayaswal, Hindu Polity, pp. 12-13</ref>\n\n=== Other Vedic texts ===\nIn post-Rigvedic literature, the disappearance of the Sarasvati is mentioned.  Also the origin of the Sarasvati is identified as [[Plaksa]] Prasravana (Peepal tree or Ashwattha tree as known in India and Nepal).<ref>Pancavimsa Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Latyayana Srauta; Macdonell and Keith 1912</ref><ref>Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, Sankhayana Srauta Sutra; Macdonell and Keith 1912, II: 55</ref>\n\nIn a supplementary chapter of the [[Vajasaneyi-Samhita]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (34.11), Sarasvati is mentioned in a context apparently meaning the Sindhu: \"Five rivers flowing on their way speed onward to Sarasvati, but then become Sarasvati a fivefold river in the land.\"<ref>Griffith, p.492</ref> According to the medieval commentator Uvata, the five tributaries of the Sarasvati were the Punjab rivers [[Drishadvati]], Satudri ([[Sutlej]]), Chandrabhaga ([[Chenab River|Chenab]]), [[Vipasa]] ([[Beas River|Beas]]) and the [[Iravati]] ([[Ravi River|Ravi]]).\n\nThe first reference to the disappearance of the lower course of the Sarasvati is from the [[Brahmana]]s, texts that are composed in [[Vedic Sanskrit]], but dating to a later date than the Veda Samhitas. The Jaiminiya Brahmana (2.297) speaks of the 'diving under (upamajjana) of the Sarasvati', and the [[Tandya Brahmana]] (or Pancavimsa Br.) calls this the 'disappearance' (vinasana). The same text (25.10.11-16) records that the Sarasvati  is 'so to say  meandering' (kubjimati) as it could not sustain heaven which it had  propped up.{{sfn|Witzel|1984}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=\"Witzel\"|See Witzel (1984){{sfn|Witzel|1984}} for discussion; for maps (1984) of the area, p. 42 sqq.}}\n\nThe Plaksa Prasravana (place of appearance/source of the river) may refer to a spring in the Siwalik mountains. The distance between the source and the Vinasana (place of disappearance of the river) is said to be 44&nbsp;[[Ashwin]] (between several hundred and 1,600&nbsp;miles) (Tandya Br. 25.10.16; cf.

According to this reference, 44&nbsp;asvins may be over 2,600&nbsp;km</ref>\n\nIn the [[Latyayana Srautasutra]] (10.15-19) the Sarasvati seems to be a perennial river up to the Vinasana, which is west of its confluence with the Drshadvati (Chautang). The Drshadvati is described as a seasonal stream (10.17), meaning it was not from Himalayas.

The dried-up, seasonal [[Ghaggar River]] in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]] reflects the same geographical view described in the [[Mahabharata]].\n\nAccording to Hindu scriptures, a journey was made during the Mahabharata by Balrama along the banks of the Saraswati from Dwarka to Mathura.

[[Patanjali]]'s [[Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya]] defines Aryavarta like the Vasistha Dharma Sutra.\n* The [[Baudhayana]] ''Dharmasutra'' gives similar definitions,  declaring that Aryavarta is the land that lies west of Kalakavana, east of [[Adarsana]] (where the Sarasvati disappears in the desert), south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the [[Vindhyas]].\n\n=== Contemporary mythological meaning ===\n[[File:NorthIndiaCircuit 250.jpg|thumb|Triveni Sangam, Allahabad \u2013 the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the \"unseen\" Sarasvati.]]\n\nDiana Eck notes that the power and significance of the Sarasvati for present-day India is in the persistent symbolic presence at the confluence of rivers all over India.{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=145}} Although \"materially missing\",{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=148}} she is the third river, which emerges to join in the meeting of rivers, thereby making the waters thrice holy.{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=148}}\n\nAfter the Vedic Sarasvati dried, new myths about the rivers arose.

The description of the ''Naditama Sarasvati'' in the Rigveda matches the physical features of the [[Helmand River]] in Afghanistan, more precisely its tributary the [[Harut River]], whose older name was ''Harax<sup>v</sup>at\u012b'' in Avestan. The later Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls ''Vinasana Sarasvati'', is described in the Rigvedic Nadistuti sukta (10.75), which was composed centuries later, after an eastward migration of the bearers of the Rigvedic culture to the western [[Ganges River|Gangetic]] plain some 600&nbsp;km to the east. The Sarasvati by this time had become a mythical \"disappeared\" river, and the name was transferred to the [[Ghaggar]] which disappeared in the desert.<ref name=Kochhar/> The later Rigvedic Sarasvati is only in the post-Rig Vedic Brahmanas said to disappear in the sands.

However, Mukherjee believes that \"Sarasvati\" is initially used by the Rig Vedic people as an adjective to the Indus as a large river and later evolved into a \"noun\". Mukherjee concludes that the Vedic poets had not seen the palaeo-Sarasvati, and that what they described in the Vedic verses refers to something else. He also suggests that in the post-Vedic and Puranic tradition the \"disappearance\" of Sarasvati, which to refers to \"[going] under [the] ground in the sands\", was created as a complementary myth to explain the visible non-existence of the river.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=2, 6-9}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brahmavarta]]\n* [[Drishadwati]] River\n* [[Sapta Sindhu]]\n* [[Saraswati]] - goddess\n* [[Indus River]]\n* [[Saraswat Brahmins]]\n* [[Triveni Sangam]]\n* [[The Lost River|Michel Danino - The lost River]]\n* [[Sarasvati Pushkaram]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Citation | last =Anthony | first =David W. | year =2007 | title =The Horse The Wheel And Language.

Similarly the Rigveda lacks a conceptual familiarity with key aspects of organized urban life (e.g. non-kin labour, facets or items of an exchange system or complex weights and measures) and doesn't mention objects found in great numbers at Indus Valley civilization sites like terracotta figurines, sculptural representation of human bodies or seals.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[Romila Thapar]]|title=Early India|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-1430-2989-2|page=110}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''{{IAST|Sarasvat\u012b}}'' is the feminine nominative singular form of the adjective ''{{IAST|sarasvat}}'' (which occurs in the [[Rigveda]]<ref>e.g. 7.96.4, 10.66.5</ref> as the name of the keeper of the [[celestial waters]]), derived from \u2018sarasa\u2019 + \u2018vat\u2019, meaning \u2018having\u2019.  Saras appears, in turn, to be the compound of \u2018sa\u2019, a prefix meaning \u2018with\u2019, plus \u2018rasa\u2019, sap or juice, or water, and is defined in the first instance as \u2018anything flowing or fluid\u2019 according to Monier-Williams dictionary.

In the younger Avesta, ''Harax<sup>v</sup>at\u012b'' is [[Arachosia]], a region described to be rich in rivers, and its [[Old Persian]] cognate ''Harauvati'', which gave its name to the present-day [[Harut River|H\u0101r\u016bt]] River in [[Afghanistan]], may have referred to the entire [[Helmand River|Helmand]] drainage basin (the center of Arachosia).\n\n== Importance in Hinduism==\nThe Saraswati river was revered and considered important for Hindus because it is said that it was on this river's banks, along with its tributary [[Drishadwati]], in the Vedic state of [[Brahmavarta]], that Vedic Sanskrit had its genesis,<ref>Manu (2004).

In the Manusmriti, Brahmavarta is portrayed as the \"pure\" centre of Vedic culture. Bridget and Raymond Allchin in ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan'' took the view that \"The earliest Aryan homeland in India-Pakistan (Aryavarta or Brahmavarta) was in the Punjab and in the valleys of the Sarasvati and [[Drishadvati]] rivers in the time of the Rigveda.\"<ref>Bridget Allchin, Raymond Allchin, ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, P.358.</ref>\n\n=== Rigveda ===\n[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|Map of northern India in the late Vedic period]]\n\nThe Sarasvati River is mentioned in all but the fourth book of the [[Rigveda]].

In some hymns, the Indus river seems to be more important than the Sarasavati, especially in the [[Nadistuti sukta]]. In RV 8.26.18, the white flowing Sindhu 'with golden wheels' is the most conveying or attractive of the rivers.\n* [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95.2. and other verses (e.g. [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].21.18) speak of the Sarasvati pouring \"milk and [[ghee]].\" Rivers are often likened to cows in the Rigveda, for example in [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].33.1,\n: ''\"Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling,''\n: ''[[Vipas]] and [[Sutudri]] speed down their waters.\"''\n* Rigveda,4.58.1 says \n:''\"May purifying Sarasvati with all the plenitude of her forms of plenty, rich in substance by the thought, desire our sacrifice.\"''\n:''\"She, the impeller to happy truths, the awakener in consciousness to right mentalisings, Sarasvati, upholds the sacrifice.\"''\n:''\"Sarasvati by the perception awakens in consciousness the great flood (the vast movement of the ritam) and illumines entirely all the thoughts\"''<ref>translation by Sri Aurobindo, op.cit.</ref>\n\n==== As a goddess ====\n[[File:Saraswati.jpg|thumb|Painting of Goddess Saraswati by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n{{main|Saraswati}}\n\nThe Sarasvati is mentioned some fifty times in the hymns of the Rig Veda.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  It is mentioned in thirteen hymns of the late books (1 and 10) of the Rigveda.<ref>1.3, 13, 89, 164; 10.17, 30, 64, 65, 66, 75, 110, 131, 141</ref> Only two of these references are unambiguously to the river: 10.64.9, calling for the aid of three  \"great rivers\", Sindhu, Sarasvati and [[Sarayu]]; and 10.75.5, the geographical list of the Nadistuti sukta. The others invoke Sarasvati as a goddess without direct connection to a specific river.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 10.30.12, her origin as a river goddess may explain her invocation as a protective deity in a hymn to the celestial waters. In 10.135.5, as Indra drinks [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] he is described as refreshed by Sarasvati. The invocations in 10.17 address Sarasvati as a goddess of the forefathers as well as of the present generation. In 1.13, 1.89, 10.85, 10.66 and 10.141, she is listed with other gods and goddesses, not with rivers. In 10.65, she is invoked together with \"holy thoughts\" (''{{IAST|dh\u012b}}'') and \"munificence\" (''{{IAST|pura\u1e43dhi}}''), consistent with her role as a goddess of both knowledge and fertility.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThough Sarasvati initially emerged as a river goddess in the Vedic scriptures, in later Hinduism of the [[Purana]]s, she was rarely associated with the river. Instead she emerged as an independent goddess of knowledge, learning, wisdom, music and the arts. The evolution of the river goddess into the goddess of knowledge started with later [[Brahmanas]], which identified her as ''V\u0101gdev\u012b'', the goddess of speech, perhaps due to the centrality of speech in the Vedic cult and the development of the cult on the banks of the river.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} It is also possible to postulate two originally independent goddesses that were fused into one in later Vedic times.{{sfn|Kinsley|1998|p=10, 55-57}} [[Aurobindo]] has proposed, on the other hand, that \"the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati ... She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration&nbsp;...\".<ref>K.R. Jayaswal, Hindu Polity, pp. 12-13</ref>\n\n=== Other Vedic texts ===\nIn post-Rigvedic literature, the disappearance of the Sarasvati is mentioned.  Also the origin of the Sarasvati is identified as [[Plaksa]] Prasravana (Peepal tree or Ashwattha tree as known in India and Nepal).<ref>Pancavimsa Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Latyayana Srauta; Macdonell and Keith 1912</ref><ref>Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, Sankhayana Srauta Sutra; Macdonell and Keith 1912, II: 55</ref>\n\nIn a supplementary chapter of the [[Vajasaneyi-Samhita]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (34.11), Sarasvati is mentioned in a context apparently meaning the Sindhu: \"Five rivers flowing on their way speed onward to Sarasvati, but then become Sarasvati a fivefold river in the land.\"<ref>Griffith, p.492</ref> According to the medieval commentator Uvata, the five tributaries of the Sarasvati were the Punjab rivers [[Drishadvati]], Satudri ([[Sutlej]]), Chandrabhaga ([[Chenab River|Chenab]]), [[Vipasa]] ([[Beas River|Beas]]) and the [[Iravati]] ([[Ravi River|Ravi]]).\n\nThe first reference to the disappearance of the lower course of the Sarasvati is from the [[Brahmana]]s, texts that are composed in [[Vedic Sanskrit]], but dating to a later date than the Veda Samhitas. The Jaiminiya Brahmana (2.297) speaks of the 'diving under (upamajjana) of the Sarasvati', and the [[Tandya Brahmana]] (or Pancavimsa Br.) calls this the 'disappearance' (vinasana). The same text (25.10.11-16) records that the Sarasvati  is 'so to say  meandering' (kubjimati) as it could not sustain heaven which it had  propped up.{{sfn|Witzel|1984}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=\"Witzel\"|See Witzel (1984){{sfn|Witzel|1984}} for discussion; for maps (1984) of the area, p. 42 sqq.}}\n\nThe Plaksa Prasravana (place of appearance/source of the river) may refer to a spring in the Siwalik mountains. The distance between the source and the Vinasana (place of disappearance of the river) is said to be 44&nbsp;[[Ashwin]] (between several hundred and 1,600&nbsp;miles) (Tandya Br. 25.10.16; cf.

According to this reference, 44&nbsp;asvins may be over 2,600&nbsp;km</ref>\n\nIn the [[Latyayana Srautasutra]] (10.15-19) the Sarasvati seems to be a perennial river up to the Vinasana, which is west of its confluence with the Drshadvati (Chautang). The Drshadvati is described as a seasonal stream (10.17), meaning it was not from Himalayas.

The dried-up, seasonal [[Ghaggar River]] in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]] reflects the same geographical view described in the [[Mahabharata]].\n\nAccording to Hindu scriptures, a journey was made during the Mahabharata by Balrama along the banks of the Saraswati from Dwarka to Mathura.

The Helmand  historically besides Avestan ''Haetumant'' bore the name ''Haraxvaiti'', which is the [[Avestan]] form cognate to Sanskrit ''Sarasvati''.

Both flow into a terminal lakes: the Helmand into a swamp in the [[Iranian plateau]] (the extended [[wetland]] and lake system of [[Hamun-i-Helmand]]). This matches the Rigvedic  description of the Sarasvati flowing to the ''[[samudra]]'', which according to him at that time meant 'confluence', 'lake', 'heavenly lake, ocean'; the current meaning of 'terrestrial ocean' was not even felt in the Pali Canon.<ref>Klaus, K.

The early Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls ''Naditama Sarasvati'', is described in suktas 2.41, 7.36 etc. of the family books of the Rigveda, and drains into a [[samudra]]. The description of the ''Naditama Sarasvati'' in the Rigveda matches the physical features of the [[Helmand River]] in Afghanistan, more precisely its tributary the [[Harut River]], whose older name was ''Harax<sup>v</sup>at\u012b'' in Avestan. The later Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls ''Vinasana Sarasvati'', is described in the Rigvedic Nadistuti sukta (10.75), which was composed centuries later, after an eastward migration of the bearers of the Rigvedic culture to the western [[Ganges River|Gangetic]] plain some 600&nbsp;km to the east. The Sarasvati by this time had become a mythical \"disappeared\" river, and the name was transferred to the [[Ghaggar]] which disappeared in the desert.<ref name=Kochhar/> The later Rigvedic Sarasvati is only in the post-Rig Vedic Brahmanas said to disappear in the sands. According to Kocchar the Ganga and Yamuna were small streams in the vicinity of the Harut River. When the Vedic people moved east into Punjab, they named the new rivers they encountered after the old rivers they knew from Helmand, and the ''Vinasana Sarasvati'' may correspond with the Ghaggar-Hakra river.<ref>{{citation |last=Kochhar |first=Rajesh |chapter=On the identity and chronology of the \u1e5agvedic river Sarasvat\u012b |title=Archaeology and Language III; Artefacts, languages and texts |editor1=Roger Blench |editor2=Matthew Spriggs |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-415-10054-0 |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8jfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA257}}</ref><ref name=\"Kocchar\">Rajesh Kocchar, [http://rajeshkochhar.com/tag/rigveda/ The rivers Sarasvati: Reconciling the sacred texts], blog post based on ''The Vedic People: Their History and Geography''.</ref>\n\nRomila Thapar has also suggested that the Sarasvati river is the ancient Haraxvati river of Afghanistan, noticing that the descriptions of the Sarasvati flowing through the \"high mountains\" cannot be reconciled with the actual course of the present-day Ghaggar-Hakkar river.<ref name=\"Thapar2004\"/>\n\n===Contemporary politico-religious meaning ===\n\n==== Drying-up and dating of the Vedas ====\nThe Vedic and Puranic statements about the drying-up and diving-under of the Sarasvati have been used as a reference point for the dating of the Harappan civilisation and the Vedic culture.<ref name=\"EB-Sarasvati\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sarasvati|title=Sarasvati &#124; Hindu deity|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Some see these texts as evidence for an earlier dating of the Rig Veda, identifying the Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra River, rejecting the [[Indo-Aryan migration hypothesis|Indo-Aryan migrations theory]], which postulates a migration at 1500 BCE.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=IE|According to David Anthony, the [[Yamna culture]] was the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|\"Urheimat\"]] of the Indo-Europeans at the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} From this area, which already included various subcultures, Indo-European languages spread west, south and east starting around 4,000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} These languages may have been carried by small groups of males, with patron-client systems which allowed for the inclusion of other groups into their cultural system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Eastward emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100\u20131800 BCE), from which developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (1800\u20131400 BCE).

However, Mukherjee believes that \"Sarasvati\" is initially used by the Rig Vedic people as an adjective to the Indus as a large river and later evolved into a \"noun\". Mukherjee concludes that the Vedic poets had not seen the palaeo-Sarasvati, and that what they described in the Vedic verses refers to something else. He also suggests that in the post-Vedic and Puranic tradition the \"disappearance\" of Sarasvati, which to refers to \"[going] under [the] ground in the sands\", was created as a complementary myth to explain the visible non-existence of the river.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=2, 6-9}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brahmavarta]]\n* [[Drishadwati]] River\n* [[Sapta Sindhu]]\n* [[Saraswati]] - goddess\n* [[Indus River]]\n* [[Saraswat Brahmins]]\n* [[Triveni Sangam]]\n* [[The Lost River|Michel Danino - The lost River]]\n* [[Sarasvati Pushkaram]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{Citation | last =Anthony | first =David W. | year =2007 | title =The Horse The Wheel And Language.

{"title_page": "Ernoul", "text_new": "'''Ernoul''' was a squire of [[Balian of Ibelin]] who wrote an eyewitness account of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] in 1187. This was later incorporated into an [[Old French]] history of [[Crusader states|Crusader Palestine]] now known as the '''''Chronicle of Ernoul and Bernard the Treasurer''''' ({{lang-fr|La Chronique d'Ernoul et de Bernard le tr\u00e9sorier}}), often abbreviated '''''Ernoul-Bernard'''''. The chronicle covers the years from 1100 until 1228. A few manuscripts copied for Bernard, treasurer of [[Corbie Abbey]], extend the narrative down to 1232.{{sfn|Nicholson|2006}}\n\n==Authorship==\nErnoul himself is mentioned only once in history, and only in his own chronicle. He was a [[squire]] of [[Balian of Ibelin]], an important crusader noble in [[Jerusalem]], and accompanied his lord on an embassy from King [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy of Jerusalem]] to Count [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] in 1187. Balian and his retinue remained behind for a day at [[Nablus]] during the voyage to Tripoli; the rest were ambushed at the [[Battle of Cresson]] on May 1. It was Ernoul who investigated the almost-empty [[Knights Templar|Templar]] castle of [[La F\u00e8ve]] before news of the battle reached Balian. No other mention is made of Ernoul. However, it is clear that he was at the [[Battle of Hattin]] on July 4, as his chronicle gives an account from the rearguard, which was commanded by his master Balian.\n\nAccording to M. R. Morgan, the squire Ernoul was the same man as [[Arneis of Gibelet]], who was an important noble in the crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] in the first half of the 13th century, and must have been connected to the [[Ibelin family|Ibelin]]s, who were also important there; the Gibelets had strong ties to the Ibelins throughout the 12th and 13th centuries in both Jerusalem and Cyprus. This identification is rejected by Peter Edbury, who suggests that Arneis lived too late to be Ernoul, and also that their names are too dissimilar.\n\n==The chronicle==\n\nThe ''Chronicle of Ernoul'' is found in a number of separate but similar manuscripts, stemming from an original source that [[Lost works|does not survive]] but assumed to have been written by Ernoul himself. The basis of these is a 13th-century [[Old French]] translation of the [[Latin]] chronicle of [[William of Tyre]], who wrote in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the mid- to late-12th century. This French translation came to be known as the ''History of Heraclius'' or the ''Estoire de Eracles'', because William of Tyre began his chronicle with the reign of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Heraclius]].\n\nOne of the more important manuscripts is known as the ''Lyon Eracles'', which is the basis of modern editions.  It was edited by Morgan as ''La Continuation de Guillaume de Tyr (1183&ndash;1197)''.  This manuscript continues until 1248, and the section containing the years 1184&ndash;1197 is not found in any other manuscript. The 19th century ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'', a collection of crusade texts compiled by the [[Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]], used a different version of the ''Eracles'' known as the ''Colbert-Fontainebleau Eracles''. There is also a shorter manuscript known as the ''abr\u00e9g\u00e9'', and a ''Florentine Eracles'' from the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]] which has a unique section from 1191 to 1197 and continues until 1277.\n\nThe text known as ''The Chronicle of Ernoul and Bernard the Treasurer'', edited by L. de Mas Latrie in the 19th century, has a separate manuscript tradition. It is essentially the same as the ''abr\u00e9g\u00e9'', and appears to have been produced from the French translation of William of Tyre, which was then mostly removed except for a few sections. It carries on until 1227 or 1231, depending on the manuscript.\n\nThe surviving texts were written in their final form from the 1230s to the 1250s. Ernoul himself may have written only a small part, covering the years 1186 and 1187, in which Balian and the Ibelin family feature prominently.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |first=Peter W. |last=Edbury |title=The Conquest of Jerusalem and the Third Crusade: Sources in Translation |publisher=Ashgate |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |first=Peter W. |last=Edbury |chapter=Ernoul, ''Eracles'' and the Beginnings of Frankish Rule in Cyprus, 1191\u20131232 |title=Medieval Cyprus: A Place of Cultural Encounter |year=2015 |editor1=Sabine Rogge |editor2=Michael Gr\u00fcnbart |publisher=Waxmann Verlag |pages=29\u201352}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |first=Peter W. |last=Edbury |chapter=''Ernoul'', ''Eracles'' and the Fifth Crusade |title=The Fifth Crusade in Context: The Crusading Movement in the Early Thirteenth Century |editor1=E.

The order and number of the stanzas varies in these sources. Some editors and translators have further rearranged the material. The Codex Regius version is usually taken as a base for editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThe poem starts with the [[v\u00f6lva]] requesting silence from \"the sons of [[Heimdallr]]\" (human beings) and asking [[Odin]] whether he wants her to recite ancient lore. She says she remembers [[J\u00f6tunn|giants]] born in antiquity who reared her.\n\nShe then goes on to relate a [[creation myth]] and mentions [[Ymir]]; the world was empty until the sons of [[Borr|Burr]] lifted the earth out of the sea. The [[\u00c6sir]] then established order in the cosmos by finding places for the sun, the moon and the stars, thereby starting the cycle of day and night. A golden age ensued where the \u00c6sir had plenty of gold and happily constructed temples and made tools. But then three mighty giant maidens came from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]] and the golden age came to an end. The \u00c6sir then created the [[Norse dwarf|dwarves]], of whom [[M\u00f3tsognir]] and [[Durinn]] are the mightiest.\n\n{{anchor|Dvergatal}}\nAt this point ten of the poem's stanzas are over and six stanzas ensue which contain names of dwarves. This section, sometimes called \"'''Dvergatal'''\" (\"Catalogue of Dwarves\"), is usually considered an interpolation and sometimes omitted by editors and translators.\n\nAfter the \"Dvergatal\", the creation of the [[Ask and Embla|first man and woman]] are recounted and [[Yggdrasil]], the world-tree, is described. The seer recalls the burning of [[Gullveig]] that led to the first \"folk\" war, and what occurred in the struggle between the \u00c6sir and [[Vanir]]. She then recalls the time Freyja was given to the giants, which is commonly interpreted as a reference to the myth of the giant builder, as told in [[Gylfaginning]] 42.\n\nThe seeress then reveals to [[Odin]] that she knows some of his own secrets, and that he sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge. She tells him she knows [[M\u00edmisbrunnr|where his eye is hidden]] and how he gave it up in exchange for knowledge. She asks him in several refrains if he understands, or if he would like to hear more.\n\nIn the Codex Regius version, the seeress goes on to describe the slaying of [[Baldr]], best and fairest of the gods and the enmity of [[Loki]], and of others. Then she prophesies the destruction of the gods where fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight their final battles with their enemies. This is the \"fate of the gods\" - [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. She describes the summons to battle, the deaths of many of the gods and how Odin, himself, is slain by [[Fenrir]], the great wolf. [[Thor]], the god of thunder and sworn protector of the earth, faces [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], the world serpent, and wins but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing due to the serpent's venom. V\u00ed\u00f0arr faces Fenrir and kicks his jaw open before stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The god [[Freyr]] fights the giant [[Surtr]], who wields a fiery sword that shines brighter than the sun, and Freyr falls. \n[[File:After Ragnar\u00f6k by Doepler.jpg|thumb|The new world that rises after Ragnar\u00f6k (depiction by [[Emil Doepler]])]]\nFinally a beautiful reborn world will rise from the ashes of death and destruction where [[Baldr]] and [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]] will live again in a new world where the earth sprouts abundance without sowing seed.

The order and number of the stanzas varies in these sources. Some editors and translators have further rearranged the material. The Codex Regius version is usually taken as a base for editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThe poem starts with the [[v\u00f6lva]] requesting silence from \"the sons of [[Heimdallr]]\" (human beings) and asking [[Odin]] whether he wants her to recite ancient lore. She says she remembers [[J\u00f6tunn|giants]] born in antiquity who reared her.\n\nShe then goes on to relate a [[creation myth]] and mentions [[Ymir]]; the world was empty until the sons of [[Borr|Burr]] lifted the earth out of the sea. The [[\u00c6sir]] then established order in the cosmos by finding places for the sun, the moon and the stars, thereby starting the cycle of day and night. A golden age ensued where the \u00c6sir had plenty of gold and happily constructed temples and made tools. But then three mighty giant maidens came from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]] and the golden age came to an end. The \u00c6sir then created the [[Norse dwarf|dwarves]], of whom [[M\u00f3tsognir]] and [[Durinn]] are the mightiest.\n\n{{anchor|Dvergatal}}\nAt this point ten of the poem's stanzas are over and six stanzas ensue which contain names of dwarves. This section, sometimes called \"'''Dvergatal'''\" (\"Catalogue of Dwarves\"), is usually considered an interpolation and sometimes omitted by editors and translators.\n\nAfter the \"Dvergatal\", the creation of the [[Ask and Embla|first man and woman]] are recounted and [[Yggdrasil]], the world-tree, is described. The seer recalls the burning of [[Gullveig]] that led to the first \"folk\" war, and what occurred in the struggle between the \u00c6sir and [[Vanir]]. She then recalls the time Freyja was given to the giants, which is commonly interpreted as a reference to the myth of the giant builder, as told in [[Gylfaginning]] 42.\n\nThe seeress then reveals to [[Odin]] that she knows some of his own secrets, and that he sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge. She tells him she knows [[M\u00edmisbrunnr|where his eye is hidden]] and how he gave it up in exchange for knowledge. She asks him in several refrains if he understands, or if he would like to hear more.\n\nIn the Codex Regius version, the seeress goes on to describe the slaying of [[Baldr]], best and fairest of the gods and the enmity of [[Loki]], and of others. Then she prophesies the destruction of the gods where fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight their final battles with their enemies. This is the \"fate of the gods\" - [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. She describes the summons to battle, the deaths of many of the gods and how Odin, himself, is slain by [[Fenrir]], the great wolf. [[Thor]], the god of thunder and sworn protector of the earth, faces [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], the world serpent, and wins but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing due to the serpent's venom. V\u00ed\u00f0arr faces Fenrir and kicks his jaw open before stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The god [[Freyr]] fights the giant [[Surtr]], who wields a fiery sword that shines brighter than the sun, and Freyr falls. \n[[File:After Ragnar\u00f6k by Doepler.jpg|thumb|The new world that rises after Ragnar\u00f6k (depiction by [[Emil Doepler]])]]\nFinally a beautiful reborn world will rise from the ashes of death and destruction where [[Baldr]] and [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]] will live again in a new world where the earth sprouts abundance without sowing seed. The surviving \u00c6sir reunite with [[H\u0153nir]] and meet together at the field of [[I\u00f0av\u00f6llr]], discussing J\u00f6rmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet.

When the new [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Earl of Sandwich]] withdrew his support for the government, Handasyd lost his seat in the [[1741 British general election|1741 General election]]. In 1745, he was appointed Governor of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], near the family home in [[Elsdon, Northumberland]]. Its role as a border fortress ended after the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Union]] and its defences had been allowed to decay. The regular army was in [[Flanders]], fighting in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and so positions like Berwick were held by retired or elderly officers like Handasyd; [[Edinburgh Castle]] was commanded by [[George Preston]], who was 87 years old. The [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 Jacobite Rising]] unexpectedly restored its importance, especially after the government defeat at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]] in September. When Sir John Cope arrived in Berwick after the battle, he was relieved of command and as senior officer, Handasyd became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland. \n[[File:Hanover Square from Stow's London Squares (1750).JPG|thumb|right|[[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]], ca 1750 where Handasyd rented a house; he died here on 4 January 1763]]\nThe Jacobites spent the next month in [[Edinburgh]] debating strategy; [[George Wade|General Wade]], commander at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], instructed Handasyd to establish a supply base at Berwick and obtain information on rebel movements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manuscript of the Month September 2014 |url=https://www.hoaresbank.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/Documents/Sept%2014%20-%20Field%20Marshal%20Wade%27s%20Proclamation.pdf |website=Hoares Bank |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref> After the Jacobite army left Edinburgh on 4 November, Wade ordered Handasyd to re-occupy it; his lack of experience meant it was conducted with what Wade considered excessive caution but he entered the town on 14 November without opposition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Royle |first1=Trevor |title=Culloden; Scotland's Last Battle and the Forging of the British Empire|date=2016 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-1408704011|page=33}}</ref>  The Jacobites reached [[Derby]] before returning to Scotland in late December; Handasyd's brief spell in command ended when Henry Hawley arrived in Edinburgh on 5 January and took over as Commander-in-Chief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riding |first1=Jacqueline |title=Jacobites: A New History of the 45 Rebellion |date=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1408819128|p=201}}</ref>\n\nHawley was replaced in July by the [[Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle|Earl of Albemarle]], who described Scotland as 'the worst country existing;' Handasyd reportedly complained he should have been appointed instead.
