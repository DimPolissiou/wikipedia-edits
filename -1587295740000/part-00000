He had been active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], founding and supervising the monastery of [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near [[Warsaw]], operating an [[amateur radio |amateur-radio]] station (SP3RN), and founding or running several other organizations and publications.\n \nOn 10 October 1982 [[Pope John Paul II]] [[canonization |canonized]] Father Kolbe and declared him a [[martyr of charity]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church | Catholic Church]] venerates him as the [[patron saint]] of amateur-radio operators, of drug addicts, of [[political prisoner]]s, of families, of journalists, of prisoners, and of the [[pro-life movement]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> John Paul II declared him \"The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century\".<ref name=\"Holy Mass at the Brzezinka Concentration Camp\"/> His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death.\n\nDue to Kolbe's efforts to promote [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]], he is known as the ''Apostle of Consecration to Mary''.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-51\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nRajmund Kolbe  was born on 8 January 1894 in [[Zdu\u0144ska Wola]], in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the second son of weaver Julius Kolbe and [[Midwifery|midwife]] Maria D\u0105browska.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> His father was an [[ethnic German]]<ref name=\"Strzelecka1984\"/> and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. He had four brothers. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to [[Pabianice]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe's life was strongly influenced in 1906, when he was 12, by a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> He later described this incident:\n\n<blockquote>That night I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-50\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Franciscan friar===\nIn 1907 Kolbe and his elder brother Francis joined the [[Conventual Franciscans]].<ref name=catholic-pages/> They enrolled at the Conventual Franciscan minor seminary in [[Lviv|Lwow]] later that year. In 1910, Kolbe was allowed to enter the [[novitiate]], where he was given the [[religious name]] Maximilian. He professed his [[first vows]] in 1911, and [[final vows]] in 1914,<ref name=\"Patron\"/> adopting the additional name of Maria (Mary).<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe was sent to [[Rome]] in 1912, where he attended the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He earned a [[doctor of philosophy|doctorate in philosophy]] in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the [[Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure]], where he earned a [[doctor of theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1919<ref name=\"psb296\"/> or 1922<ref name=\"Patron\"/> (sources vary). He was active in the [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]]. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against [[Pope Pius X|Popes St. Pius X]] and [[Benedict XV]] in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the [[Freemasons]]. According to Kolbe, \n\n<blockquote>They placed the black standard of the \"[[Giordano Bruno|Giordano Brunisti]]\" under the windows of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. On this standard the archangel, [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]], was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully.<ref name=\"biosummary\"/><ref name=\"anniversary\"/></blockquote> \n\nSoon afterward, on 16 October 1917, Kolbe organized the [[Militia Immaculatae]] (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: \n\n<blockquote>O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. ''And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee''.<ref name=\"Daily Prayers\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1918, Kolbe was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest.<ref name=ewtn/> In July 1919 he returned to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland, which was newly independent]]. He was active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. He was strongly opposed to leftist \u2013 in particular, [[communist]] \u2013 movements.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> \n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 he taught at the [[Krak\u00f3w seminary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> Around that time, as well as earlier in Rome, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]], which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties. TB was generally considered fatal, with rest and good nutrition the best treatment, as antibiotics had not been developed to treat it.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nIn January 1922 Kolbe founded the monthly periodical ''[[Rycerz Niepokalanej]]'' (''Knight of the Immaculata''), a devotional publication based on French ''[[Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus]]'' (''Messenger of the Heart of Jesus''). From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in [[Grodno]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/> As his activities grew in scope, in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near Warsaw. It became a major religious publishing centre.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> A junior seminary was opened there two years later.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> \n\n===Missionary work in Asia===\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Kolbe undertook a series of [[mission (Christian)|missions]] to [[East Asia]]. He arrived first in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], but failed to gather a following there.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> Next he moved to [[Japan]], where by 1931 he had founded a [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual|Franciscan monastery]], ''Mugenzai no Sono'', on the outskirts of [[Nagasaki]].  \n\nKolbe had started publishing a Japanese edition of the ''Knight of the Immaculata'' (''Seibo no Kishi'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Kolbe had the monastery built on a mountainside. According to [[Shinto]] beliefs, this was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. However, when the United States dropped the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Nagasaki]], the Franciscan monastery survived, unlike the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]], because it was on the side of the mountain which took the main force of the blast.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> \n\nIn mid-1932 Kolbe left Japan for [[Malabar region|Malabar]], [[India]], where he founded another monastery. This one closed after a while.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n===Return to Poland===\nMeanwhile, in his absence the monastery at Niepokalan\u00f3w began to publish a daily newspaper, ''Ma\u0142y Dziennik'' (''the Small Diary''), in alliance with a political group, the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] (''Ob\u00f3z Narodowo Radykalny'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> This publication reached a circulation of 137,000, and nearly double that, 225,000 on weekends.<ref name=\"Media katolickie w III Rzeczypospolitej (1989\u20132009)\"/> Kolbe returned to Poland in 1933 for a general chapter of the order in Krakow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elaine Murray Stone|title=Maximilian Kolbe|url=https://archive.org/details/maximiliankolbes00elai|url-access=registration|quote=city mary india kolbe.|publisher=Paulist Press|place=Nueva York|year=1997|page=[https://archive.org/details/maximiliankolbes00elai/page/53 53]|isbn=0-8091-6637-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Mary Kalvelage|title=Kolbe: Saint of the Immaculata|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ZbruAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=Mugenzai+no+Sono+1931&source=bl&ots=ha1oqvFxYd&sig=ACfU3U0lYamm28e7oo-TyFvK7B-oyuxNjQ&hl=es&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjCpOfz2-PmAhUSkRQKHRvGBfAQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Mugenzai%20no%20Sono%201931&f=false|pages=62-63|year=2001|isbn=9780898708851}}</ref> Poor health forced Kolbe to stay in Poland.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Two years later, in 1938, he started a radio station at Niepokalan\u00f3w, ''Radio Niepokalan\u00f3w''.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Historia\"/> He held an [[amateur radio]] licence, with the call sign SP3RN.<ref name=\"qrz\"/>\n\n===Death at Auschwitz===\n[[File:Todeszelle Pater Maximilian Kolbes, KZ Auschwitz I, Block 11.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Saint Maximilian Kolbe's prison cell in [[Block 11]], Auschwitz concentration camp]]\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War II]], Kolbe was one of the few friars who remained in the monastery, where he organized a temporary hospital.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> After the town was captured by the Germans, he was arrested by them on 19 September 1939 but released on 8 December.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> He refused to sign the [[Volksliste|Deutsche Volksliste]], which would have given him rights similar to those of German citizens, in exchange for recognizing his ethnic German ancestry.<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Upon his release he continued work at his friary, where he and other friars provided shelter to refugees from [[Greater Poland]], including 2,000 Jews whom he hid from German persecution in the Niepokalan\u00f3w friary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/><ref name=guardian/><ref name=\"psb297\"/><ref name=\"Kolbe, Saint of Auschwitz\"/> Kolbe received permission to continue publishing religious works, though significantly reduced in scope.<ref name=\"psb297\"/> The monastery continued to act as a publishing house, issuing a number of anti-Nazi German publications.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nOn 17 February 1941, the monastery was shut down by the German authorities.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> That day Kolbe and four others were arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and imprisoned in the [[Pawiak]] prison.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> On 28 May, he was transferred to [[Auschwitz]] as prisoner 16670.<ref name=\"Sixty-ninth Anniversary of the Death of St. Maximilian Kolbe\"/>\n\nContinuing to act as a priest, Kolbe was subjected to violent harassment, including beating and lashings. Once he was smuggled to a prison hospital by friendly inmates.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb297\"/> At the end of July 1941, one prisoner escaped from the camp, prompting [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Karl Fritzsch]], the deputy camp commander, to pick ten men to be starved to death in an underground bunker to deter further escape attempts. When one of the selected men, [[Franciszek Gajowniczek]], cried out, \"My wife! My children!\", Kolbe volunteered to take his place.<ref name=\"catholic-pages\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1973 771 Maximilian Kolbe.jpg|thumb|right|Maximilian Kolbe, on a West German postage stamp, marked [[Auschwitz]]]]<!--why is his death date given as the 15th?-->\nAccording to an eyewitness, who was an assistant janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer. Each time the guards checked on him, he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. After they had been starved and deprived of water for two weeks, only Kolbe remained alive. The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of [[phenol|carbolic acid]]. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection.<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> He died on 14 August. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the [[calendar of saints|feast day]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/>\n\n==Canonization==\nOn 12 May 1955 Kolbe was recognized by the Vatican as a [[Servant of God]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Kolbe was declared [[venerable]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 January 1969, [[beatification|beatified]] as a [[Confessor of the Faith]] by the same Pope in 1971, and [[canonized]] as a [[saint]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 10 October 1982.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Plunka2012\"/> Upon canonization, the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe as a confessor, and a [[martyr]] of charity.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> The miracles that were used to confirm his beatification were the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela Testoni, and in August 1950, the cure of calcification of the arteries/sclerosis of Francis Ranier; both attributed to Kolbe's intercession by their prayers to him.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n[[File:WestminsterAbbey-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of Kolbe (left) above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey]]\nAfter his canonization, a feast day for St. Maximilian Kolbe was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]]. He is one of ten 20th-century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of [[Anglican]] [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref name=\"westminster\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\nKolbe's recognition as a [[Christian martyrs|Christian martyr]] generated some controversy within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> While his self-sacrifice at Auschwitz was considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed out of ''odium fidei'' (hatred of the faith), but as the result of his act of [[Charity (virtue)|Christian charity]] toward another man. [[Pope Paul VI]] recognized this distinction at Kolbe's beatification, naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title \"martyr of charity\". Pope John Paul II, however, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity). John Paul II wanted to make the point that the Nazis systematic hatred of whole categories of humanity was inherently also a hatred of religious (Christian) faith; he said that Kolbe's death equated to earlier examples of religious martyrdom.<ref name=peterson/>\n\nKolbe has been accused of [[antisemitism]]. In 1926, in the first issue of the monthly Knight of the Immaculate, Father Kolbe said he considered Freemasons ''as an organized clique of fanatical Jews, who want to destroy the church.'' Writing in a calendar that the publishing house of his organization, the Militia of the Immaculate, published in an edition of a million in 1939, Father Kolbe said: \"''Atheistic Communism seems to rage ever more wildly. Its origin can easily be located in that criminal mafia that calls itself Freemasonry, and the hand that is guiding all that toward a clear goal is international Zionism. Which should not be taken to mean that even among Jews one cannot find good people.''\"<ref>New York Times, 19 November 1982 'Saint charged with bigotry' [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/saint-charged-with-bigotry-clerics-say-no.html&usg=AOvVaw0Y7PFO6rmsgqrLHeEtJiFQ]</ref> Newspapers he published printed articles about topics such as a [[Zionism|Zionist]] plot for world domination.<ref name=\"Dershowitz1992\"/><ref name=\"jta\"/><ref name=\"Michael2008\"/> Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] criticized Kolbe's activities as \"writing and organizing mass propaganda for the Catholic Church, with a clear anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic edge.\"<ref name=jta/><ref name=\"Zizek2012\"/> However, a number of writers pointed out that the \"Jewish question played a very minor role in Kolbe's thought and work\".<ref name=jta/><ref name=BeckyReady/> On those grounds allegations of Kolbe's antisemitism have been denounced by [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholars]] Daniel L.

Since his [[beatification]] in 1971, more than 1,000 such relics have been distributed around the world for public veneration.

Franciscans|Conventual Franciscan]] [[friar]] who volunteered to die in place of a stranger in the German [[extermination camp | death camp]] of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], located in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945) | German-occupied Poland]] during [[World War II]]. He had been active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], founding and supervising the monastery of [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near [[Warsaw]], operating an [[amateur radio |amateur-radio]] station (SP3RN), and founding or running several other organizations and publications.\n \nOn 10 October 1982 [[Pope John Paul II]] [[canonization |canonized]] Father Kolbe and declared him a [[martyr of charity]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church | Catholic Church]] venerates him as the [[patron saint]] of amateur-radio operators, of drug addicts, of [[political prisoner]]s, of families, of journalists, of prisoners, and of the [[pro-life movement]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> John Paul II declared him \"The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century\".<ref name=\"Holy Mass at the Brzezinka Concentration Camp\"/> His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death.\n\nDue to Kolbe's efforts to promote [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]], he is known as the ''Apostle of Consecration to Mary''.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-51\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nRajmund Kolbe  was born on 8 January 1894 in [[Zdu\u0144ska Wola]], in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the second son of weaver Julius Kolbe and [[Midwifery|midwife]] Maria D\u0105browska.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> His father was an [[ethnic German]]<ref name=\"Strzelecka1984\"/> and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. He had four brothers. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to [[Pabianice]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe's life was strongly influenced in 1906, when he was 12, by a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> He later described this incident:\n\n<blockquote>That night I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-50\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Franciscan friar===\nIn 1907 Kolbe and his elder brother Francis joined the [[Conventual Franciscans]].<ref name=catholic-pages/> They enrolled at the Conventual Franciscan minor seminary in [[Lviv|Lwow]] later that year. In 1910, Kolbe was allowed to enter the [[novitiate]], where he was given the [[religious name]] Maximilian. He professed his [[first vows]] in 1911, and [[final vows]] in 1914,<ref name=\"Patron\"/> adopting the additional name of Maria (Mary).<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe was sent to [[Rome]] in 1912, where he attended the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He earned a [[doctor of philosophy|doctorate in philosophy]] in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the [[Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure]], where he earned a [[doctor of theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1919<ref name=\"psb296\"/> or 1922<ref name=\"Patron\"/> (sources vary). He was active in the [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]]. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against [[Pope Pius X|Popes St. Pius X]] and [[Benedict XV]] in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the [[Freemasons]]. According to Kolbe, \n\n<blockquote>They placed the black standard of the \"[[Giordano Bruno|Giordano Brunisti]]\" under the windows of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. On this standard the archangel, [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]], was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully.<ref name=\"biosummary\"/><ref name=\"anniversary\"/></blockquote> \n\nSoon afterward, on 16 October 1917, Kolbe organized the [[Militia Immaculatae]] (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: \n\n<blockquote>O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. ''And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee''.<ref name=\"Daily Prayers\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1918, Kolbe was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest.<ref name=ewtn/> In July 1919 he returned to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland, which was newly independent]]. He was active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. He was strongly opposed to leftist \u2013 in particular, [[communist]] \u2013 movements.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> \n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 he taught at the [[Krak\u00f3w seminary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> Around that time, as well as earlier in Rome, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]], which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties. TB was generally considered fatal, with rest and good nutrition the best treatment, as antibiotics had not been developed to treat it.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nIn January 1922 Kolbe founded the monthly periodical ''[[Rycerz Niepokalanej]]'' (''Knight of the Immaculata''), a devotional publication based on French ''[[Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus]]'' (''Messenger of the Heart of Jesus''). From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in [[Grodno]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/> As his activities grew in scope, in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near Warsaw. It became a major religious publishing centre.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> A junior seminary was opened there two years later.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> \n\n===Missionary work in Asia===\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Kolbe undertook a series of [[mission (Christian)|missions]] to [[East Asia]]. He arrived first in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], but failed to gather a following there.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> Next he moved to [[Japan]], where by 1931 he had founded a [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual|Franciscan monastery]], ''Mugenzai no Sono'', on the outskirts of [[Nagasaki]].  \n\nKolbe had started publishing a Japanese edition of the ''Knight of the Immaculata'' (''Seibo no Kishi'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Kolbe had the monastery built on a mountainside. According to [[Shinto]] beliefs, this was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. However, when the United States dropped the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Nagasaki]], the Franciscan monastery survived, unlike the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]], because it was on the side of the mountain which took the main force of the blast.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> \n\nIn mid-1932 Kolbe left Japan for [[Malabar region|Malabar]], [[India]], where he founded another monastery.

When one of the selected men, [[Franciszek Gajowniczek]], cried out, \"My wife!

Each time the guards checked on him, he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. After they had been starved and deprived of water for two weeks, only Kolbe remained alive. The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of [[phenol|carbolic acid]]. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection.<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> He died on 14 August. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the [[calendar of saints|feast day]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/>\n\n==Canonization==\nOn 12 May 1955 Kolbe was recognized by the Vatican as a [[Servant of God]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Kolbe was declared [[venerable]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 January 1969, [[beatification|beatified]] as a [[Confessor of the Faith]] by the same Pope in 1971, and [[canonized]] as a [[saint]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 10 October 1982.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Plunka2012\"/> Upon canonization, the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe as a confessor, and a [[martyr]] of charity.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> The miracles that were used to confirm his beatification were the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela Testoni, and in August 1950, the cure of calcification of the arteries/sclerosis of Francis Ranier; both attributed to Kolbe's intercession by their prayers to him.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n[[File:WestminsterAbbey-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of Kolbe (left) above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey]]\nAfter his canonization, a feast day for St. Maximilian Kolbe was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]]. He is one of ten 20th-century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of [[Anglican]] [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref name=\"westminster\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\nKolbe's recognition as a [[Christian martyrs|Christian martyr]] generated some controversy within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> While his self-sacrifice at Auschwitz was considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed out of ''odium fidei'' (hatred of the faith), but as the result of his act of [[Charity (virtue)|Christian charity]] toward another man. [[Pope Paul VI]] recognized this distinction at Kolbe's beatification, naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title \"martyr of charity\". Pope John Paul II, however, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity). John Paul II wanted to make the point that the Nazis systematic hatred of whole categories of humanity was inherently also a hatred of religious (Christian) faith; he said that Kolbe's death equated to earlier examples of religious martyrdom.<ref name=peterson/>\n\nKolbe has been accused of [[antisemitism]]. In 1926, in the first issue of the monthly Knight of the Immaculate, Father Kolbe said he considered Freemasons ''as an organized clique of fanatical Jews, who want to destroy the church.'' Writing in a calendar that the publishing house of his organization, the Militia of the Immaculate, published in an edition of a million in 1939, Father Kolbe said: \"''Atheistic Communism seems to rage ever more wildly. Its origin can easily be located in that criminal mafia that calls itself Freemasonry, and the hand that is guiding all that toward a clear goal is international Zionism. Which should not be taken to mean that even among Jews one cannot find good people.''\"<ref>New York Times, 19 November 1982 'Saint charged with bigotry' [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/saint-charged-with-bigotry-clerics-say-no.html&usg=AOvVaw0Y7PFO6rmsgqrLHeEtJiFQ]</ref> Newspapers he published printed articles about topics such as a [[Zionism|Zionist]] plot for world domination.<ref name=\"Dershowitz1992\"/><ref name=\"jta\"/><ref name=\"Michael2008\"/> Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] criticized Kolbe's activities as \"writing and organizing mass propaganda for the Catholic Church, with a clear anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic edge.\"<ref name=jta/><ref name=\"Zizek2012\"/> However, a number of writers pointed out that the \"Jewish question played a very minor role in Kolbe's thought and work\".<ref name=jta/><ref name=BeckyReady/> On those grounds allegations of Kolbe's antisemitism have been denounced by [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholars]] Daniel L.

Before becoming Japan's [[head of government]], Tojo was among the most outspoken proponents for [[preventive war]] against the United States during deliberations leading to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Upon becoming Prime Minister in October 17, 1941, he presided over the conquest of much of the West's territories in Asia and the Pacific until the defeat of Japanese forces at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. During his years in power, he also oversaw the perpetration of numerous war crimes including the systematic massacre and starvation of civilians and [[prisoners of war]]. As the war's tide increasingly turned against Japan, Tojo was forced to resign as Prime Minister on July 22, 1944. After Japan's surrender in September 1945, Tojo was arrested, convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], sentenced to death, and hanged on December 23, 1948.{{sfn|Yenne|p=337}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHideki Tojo was born in the [[K\u014djimachi]] district of [[Tokyo]] on December 30, 1884,{{sfn|Gorman|p=43}} as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army.{{sfn|Butow|p=4}} Under the ''[[bakufu]]'', Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants and the [[samurai]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, ensuring that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}} The Tojo family came from the samurai caste, though the Tojo's were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (lords) that they had served for generations.{{sfn|Browne|p=11}} Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] priest, making his family very respectable, but poor.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}}\n\nHideki had an education typical of a Japanese youth in the Meiji era.{{sfn|Browne|pp=14\u201315, 19\u201320}} The purpose of the Meiji educational system was to train the boys to be soldiers as adults, and the message was relentlessly drilled into Japanese students that war was the most beautiful thing in the entire world, that the Emperor was a living god and that the greatest honor for a Japanese man was to die for the Emperor.{{sfn|Browne|pp=19\u201320}} Japanese girls were taught that the highest honor for a woman was to have as many sons as possible who could die for the Emperor in war. As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, for being an opinionated and combative youth fond of getting into fights with the other boys and for his tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for failure; those who did so were often bullied by the teachers.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo was of average intelligence, but was known to compensate for his limited intelligence with a willingness to work extremely hard.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo's boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who issued the injunction: \"Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo liked to say: \"I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}}\n\n[[File:Young Tojo.JPG|thumb|Young Hideki Tojo]]\nIn 1899, Hideki entered the Army Cadet School. When he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], which ended the [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Russia]], and which the Japanese people saw as a betrayal as the war did not end with Japan annexing [[Siberia]] as popular opinion had demanded.{{sfn|Browne|pp=23\u201324}} The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the [[Hibiya incendiary incident]] as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese at the time had understood that the war with Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}} Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}}\n\nIn 1909, Hideki married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie and Kimie).{{sfn|Baudot|p=455}}<ref>Courtney Browne, ''Tojo: The Last Banzai'', Angus & Robertson, 1967, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In 1918\u201319, Tojo briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Browne|p=27}} Tojo served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919-1922.{{sfn|Browne|p=28}} As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception.{{sfn|Browne|pp=28\u201329}} In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the \"national defense state\". In 1922, on his way home to Japan, Tojo took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic \"soft\" people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying and (despite [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) drinking.{{sfn|Browne|p=29}}\n\nTojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night, and he refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work, having his wife do all the work of taking care of his children.{{sfn|Browne|p=29-30}} A stern, humorless man, Tojo was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders, saying that face-slapping was a \"means of training\" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom ''bushido'' was not second nature.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}}\n\nIn 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Control Act]] passed by the American Congress banning all Asian immigration into the United States with many Congressmen and Senators openly saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Tojo wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals and \"It [the Immigration Control Act] shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world\".{{sfn|Browne|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBy 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, Tojo told his officers that they were to be both a \"father\" and a \"mother\" to the men under their command.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}} Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems and made loans to officers short of money.{{sfn|Browne|pp=40\u201341}} Like many other Japanese officers, Tojo disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the [[Ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]] (\"eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense\") movement as he complained about such forms of \"Western decadence\" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the ''[[kokutai]]''.{{sfn|Browne|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n== Army career ==\n=== As major general ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]\n\nIn 1934, Hideki was promoted to [[major general]] and served as Chief of the Personnel Department within the [[Minister of War of Japan|Army Ministry]].{{sfn|Fredrikson|p=507}} Tojo wrote a chapter in the book ''Hij\u014dji kokumin zensh\u016b'' (''Essays in time of national emergency''), a book published in March 1934 by the Army Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian \"national defense state\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} This book of 15 essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904\u201305 because ''bushid\u014d'' had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war (against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese war on a much greater scale by creating the \"national defense state\" that would mobilize the entire nation for war.{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} In his essay Tojo wrote \"The modern war of national defense extends over a great many areas\" requiring \"a state that can monolithically control\" all aspects of the nation in the political, social and economic spheres.{{sfn|Bix|pp=277\u2013278}} Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States for waging \"ideological war\" against Japan since 1919.{{sfn|Bix|p=278}} Tojo ended his essay stating that Japan must stand tall \"and spread its own moral principles to the world\" as the \"cultural and ideological war of the 'imperial way' is about to begin\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}}\n\nTojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934.{{sfn|Lamont-Brown|p=65}} In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the [[Kenpeitai]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]]. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed {{nihongo|\"Razor\"|\u30ab\u30df\u30bd\u30ea|Kamisori}}, for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the ''[[T\u014dseiha]]'' (\"Control\") faction in the Army that was opposed by the more radical ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' (\"Imperial Way\") faction.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} Both the ''T\u014dseiha'' and the ''K\u014dd\u014dha'' factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving these goals.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Imperial Way faction wanted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to achieve a [[Sh\u014dwa Restoration]]; emphasised \"spirit\" as the principle war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Control faction, while being willing to use assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; wanted to create the \"national defense state\" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war; and, while not rejecting the idea of \"spirit\" as a war-winning factor also saw military modernization as a war-winning factor; and saw the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}}\n\nDuring the [[February 26 Incident|February 26 coup attempt]] of 1936, Tojo and [[Shigeru Honj\u014d]], a noted supporter of [[Sadao Araki]], both opposed the rebels who were associated with the rival \"Imperial Way\" faction.{{sfn|Takemae & Ricketts|p=221}} Emperor [[Hirohito]] himself was outraged at the attacks on his close advisers, and after a brief political crisis and stalling on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander of the ''Kenpeitai'', Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo.{{sfn|Browne|p=59}} In the aftermath, the T\u014dseiha faction was able to purge the Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. Following the purge, T\u014dseiha and K\u014dd\u014dha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political stance under the banner of the T\u014dseiha military clique, with Tojo in the leadership position.\n\nTojo was promoted to [[chief of staff (military)|Chief of staff]] of the Kwangtung Army in 1937.{{sfn|Dear & Foot|p=872}} As the \"[[Manchukuo|Empire of Manchukuo]]\" was, in reality, a Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army's duties were just as much political as they were military.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} During this period, Tojo become close to [[Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka]], the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the [[South Manchuria Railway]], one of Asia's largest corporations at the time, and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], the Deputy Minister of Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man ''de facto'' in charge of Manchukuo's economy.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war with the Soviet Union as his first duty, Tojo also supported the forward policy in north China as the Japanese sought to extend their influence into China.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the [[Inner Mongolia]] border regions with [[Manchukuo]]. In July 1937, he personally led the units of the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade in [[Operation Chahar]], his only real combat experience.{{sfn|Cowley & Parker|p=473}}\n\nAfter the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] marking the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Tojo ordered his forces to attack [[Hebei Province]] and other targets in northern China. Tojo received [[Jew]]ish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected the resulting Nazi German protests.{{sfn|Goodman & Miyazawa|p=113}} Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as Vice-Minister of War under [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]].{{sfn|Kato|p=127}} From December 1938 to 1940, Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.{{sfn|''The New International Year Book''|p=320}}\n\n== Political career ==\n=== Rise to Prime Minister ===\nOn June 1, 1940, the Showa Emperor appointed [[K\u014dichi Kido]], a leading \"reform bureaucrat\" as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor's leading political advisor and fixer.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between the \"reform bureaucrats\" and the \"Control\" faction in the Army, which was headed by General Mut\u014d Akira and General Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido's appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction.{{sfn|Bix|pp=370\u2013371}} On July 30, 1940, Hideki Tojo was appointed Army Minister in the second [[Fumimaro Konoe]] regime and remained in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo\u2014a man representative of both the Army's hardline views and the Control faction while being considered reasonable to deal with\u2014to secure the Army's backing for his foreign policy.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist, well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork, who believed that the Emperor was a living god and favored \"direct imperial rule\", ensuring that he would faithfully follow any order from the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, seeking better relations with both Germany and the United States, and of taking advantage of the changes in the international order caused by Germany's victories in the spring of 1940 to make Japan a stronger power in Asia.{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}} Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a ''modus vivendi'' with the United States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the \"[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]\".{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nBy 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, no longer believed that a military solution to the \"China Affair\" was possible as he once did, instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had outlined in the \"Konoe programme\" of January 1938.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} For this reason, Konoe wanted Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide \"cover\" for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a strong supporter of the [[Tripartite Pact]] between Imperial Japan, [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]]. As the Army Minister, he continued to expand the war with China.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After negotiations with [[Vichy France]], Japan was given permission to place its troops in the southern part of [[French Indochina]] in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing [[economic sanctions]] in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports.{{sfn|Toland|p={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} On September 6, a deadline of early October was fixed in the [[Gozen Kaigi|Imperial Conference]] for resolving the situation diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress. Prime Minister Konoe then held his last cabinet meeting, where Tojo did most of the talking:\n\n{{quote |\nFor the past six months, ever since April, the foreign minister has made painstaking efforts to adjust relations. Although I respect him for that, we remain deadlocked&nbsp;... The heart of the matter is the imposition on us of withdrawal from Indochina and China&nbsp;... If we yield to America's demands, it will destroy the fruits of the China incident. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea undermined.{{sfn|Bix|p=417}}\n}}\n\nThe prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, although the Emperor himself was skeptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to [[K\u014dichi Kido]]: \"There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war.\"{{sfn|Kido|p=914}} During the last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the Americans as arrogant, bullying white supremacists. He said that any compromise solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which case Japan might be better to choose war to uphold national honor.{{sfn|Bix|pp=417\u2013418}} Despite saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten the ''kokutai''; the \"China Incident\" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.{{sfn|Bix|p=416}}\n\nOn October 16, Konoe, politically isolated and convinced that the Emperor no longer trusted him, resigned. Later, he justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita:\n\n{{quote |\nOf course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war is a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward war. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: \"My prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more.\" In short, the Emperor had absorbed the views of the army and navy high commands.{{sfn|Fujiwara|p=126}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Tojo2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hideki Tojo in military uniform]]\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing cropped2.png|170px|thumb]]\nAt the time, [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]] was said to be the only person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by Konoe and Tojo as Konoe's replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the prestige of the House of Yamato.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} Following the advice of K\u014dichi Kido, he chose instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}}{{sfn|Terasaki|p=118}} Tojo's first speech on the radio made a call for \"world peace\", but also stated his determination to settle the \"China Affair\" on Japanese terms and to achieve the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.{{sfn|Browne|p=107}} Tojo was known to advocate war with the United States, and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary about hearing of the appointment: \"We have finally committed to war and now must do all we can to launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. We needn't have signaled what we're going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort war will begin.\"{{sfn|Bix|p=419}} The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo took office.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} During the meetings of the senior statesmen to decide who was to succeed Prince Konoe, the former Prime Minister Admiral [[Keisuke Okada]] was opposed to Tojo as Prime Minister, while the powerful Lord Privy Seal [[K\u014dichi Kido]] pushed for Tojo, leading a compromise where Tojo would become Prime Minister while \"re-examining\" the options for dealing with the crisis with the United States, though Kido did not say that Tojo would attempt to avoid a war.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}} By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen before appointing a prime minister, and as long as Admiral Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}}\n\nTojo wrote in his diary: \"I thought I was summoned because the Emperor was angry at my opinion.\" He was given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.{{sfn|Bix|p=418-419}} Tojo, who was on the side of war, nevertheless accepted this order, and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, a member of the Army General Staff, the Prime Minister showed a true sense of loyalty to the emperor performing this duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for the Prime Minister for his audience with the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: \"If the Emperor said it should be so, then that's it for me. One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.\"{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff [[Hajime Sugiyama]] and [[Osami Nagano]] reported to Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=47\u201350}}{{sfn|Bix|p=421}} The next day, Fleet Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=29, 35}} The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers that Japanese defense perimeter lines\u2014operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting heavy Western casualties\u2014could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to be prepared to return to Japan on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Two days later, on November 5, Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings with the military and Tojo until the end of the month. On November 26, 1941, the American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] handed Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington a \"draft mutual declaration of policy\" and \"Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan\".{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} Hull proposed that Japan \"withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces\" from China and French Indochina in exchange for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The \"[[Hull note]]\" as it is known in Japan made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei as the government of China, but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the \"Empire of Manchukuo\"{{Opinion|date=April 2019}} and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal from China.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the \"Hull note\" to the Cabinet as an \"ultimatum to Japan\", which was incorrect as the \"Hull note\" did not have a timeline for its acceptance and was marked \"tentative\" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The claim that the Americans had demanded in the \"Hull note\" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, instead of just the parts occupied since 1937 and together with the claim the note was an ultimatum was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States.{{sfn|Bix|p=428-431}} On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the \"war against the United States, England, and the Netherlands\".{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=28\u201330, 39}}\n\n=== As Prime Minister ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo lands in Manila.jpg|thumb|Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo landed in [[Nichols Field]], an airfield south of Manila, for a state visit to the Philippines.]]\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Tojo went on Japanese radio to announce that Japan was now at war with the United States, the British Empire and the Netherlands, reading out an Imperial Rescript that ended with the playing of the popular martial song ''[[Umi Yukaba]]'' (''Across the Sea''), which set to music a popular war poem from the classic collection ''[[Many\u014dsh\u016b]]'', featuring the lyrics \"Across the sea, corpses soaking in the water, Across the mountains corpses heaped up in the grass, We shall die by the side of our lord, We shall never look back\".{{sfn|Dower|p=25}} Tojo continued to hold the position of Army Minister during his term as Prime Minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944.

As Home Minister, he ordered various [[Eugenics in Japan|eugenics]] measures (including the sterilization of the \"mentally unfit\").\n\nTojo had popular support in the early years of the war as Japanese forces moved from one victory to another. In March 1942, Tojo in his capacity as Army Minister gave permission for the Japanese Army in Taiwan to ship 50 \"[[comfort women]]\" from Taiwan to Borneo without ID papers (his approval was necessary as the Army's rules forbade people without ID traveling to the new conquests).{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} The Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi noted this document proves that Tojo was aware of and approved of the \"comfort women\" corps.{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} On April 18, 1942, the Americans staged the [[Doolittle Raid]], bombing Tokyo.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} Some of the American planes were shot down and their pilots taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The Army General Staff led by Field Marshal [[Hajime Sugiyama]] insisted on executing the eight American fliers, but were opposed by Tojo, who feared that the Americans would retaliate against Japanese POWs if the Doolittle fliers were executed.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The dispute was resolved by the Emperor who commuted the death sentences of five fliers while allowing the other three to die, for reasons that remain unclear as the documents relating to the Emperor's intervention were burned in 1945.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}}\n\nAs the Japanese went from victory to victory, Tojo and the rest of the Japanese elite were gripped by what the Japanese called \"[[victory disease]]\" as the entire elite was caught up in a state of hubris, believing Japan was invincible and the war was as good as won.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} By May 1942, Tojo approved a set of \"non-negotiable\" demands to be presented once the Allies sued for peace that allowed Japan to keep everything it already conquered while assuming possession of considerably more. {{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} Under such demands, Japan would assume control of the following territories:\n*the British Crown colonies of India and Honduras well as the British dominions of Australia, Australian New Guinea, Ceylon, New Zealand, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory \n*the American state of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii\n*most of Latin America including Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the rest of the West Indies.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} \n\nAdditionally, Tojo wanted all of China to be under the rule of the puppet [[Wang Jingwei]], planned to buy Macau and East Timor from Portugal and to create new puppet kingdoms in Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaya.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=329\u2013330}} As the Burmese had proved to be enthusiastic collaborators in the \"New Order in Asia\", the new Burmese kingdom would be allowed to annex much of north-east India as a reward.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}} The Navy for its part demanded that Japan take New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}}\n\nWhile Tojo was prime minister, the main forum for military decision-making was the Imperial General Headquarters presided over by the Emperor. It consisted of the Army and Navy ministers; the Army and Navy chiefs of staff; and chiefs of the military affairs bureaus in both services.{{sfn|Falk|p=511}} The Imperial GHQ was not a joint chiefs of staff as existed in the United States and United Kingdom, but rather two separate services command operating under the same roof who would meet about twice a week to attempt to agree on a common strategy.{{sfn|Falk|pp=511\u2013512}} The Operations Bureaus of the Army and Navy would develop their own plans and then attempt to \"sell them\" to the other, which was often not possible.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} Tojo was one voice out of many speaking at the Imperial GHQ, and was not able to impose his will on the Navy, which he had to negotiate with, like he was dealing with an ally.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} The American historian Stanley Falk described the Japanese system as characterized by \"bitter inter-service antagonisms\" as the Army and Navy worked \"at cross-purposes\", observing the Japanese system of command was \"uncoordinated, ill-defined and inefficient\".{{sfn|Falk|p=518}}\n\n[[File:Cabinet of Hideki Tojo 3.jpg|thumb|Cabinet ministers of the first Tojo Cabinet, October 1941]]\nHowever, after the [[Battle of Midway]], with the tide of war turning against Japan, Tojo faced increasing opposition from within the government and military. In August\u2013September 1942, a major crisis gripped the Tojo cabinet when the Foreign Minister [[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]] objected quite violently on August 29, 1942 to the Prime Minister's plan to establish a Greater East Asia Ministry to handle relations with the puppet regimes in Asia as an insult to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the ''Gaimusho'') and threatened to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} Tojo went to see the Emperor, who backed the Prime Minister's plans for the Greater East Asia Ministry, and on September 1, 1942 Tojo told the cabinet he was establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry and could not care less about how the ''Gaimusho'' felt about the issue, leading T\u014dg\u014d to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} The American historian Herbert Bix wrote that Tojo was a \"dictator\" only in the narrow sense that from September 1942 on, he was generally able to impose his will on the Cabinet without seeking a consensus, but at same time noted that Tojo's authority was based upon the support of the Emperor, who held ultimate power.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} In November 1942, Tojo, as Army Minister, was involved in drafting the regulations for taking \"comfort women\" from China, Japan (which included Taiwan and Korea at this time) and Manchukuo to the \"South\", as the Japanese called their conquests in South-East Asia, to ensure that the \"comfort women\" had the proper papers before departing. Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take \"comfort women\" without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests.{{sfn|Yoshimi|p=83}} At the same time, Tojo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not. Tojo sacked the Operations office and his deputy at the general staff, who were opposed to withdrawing, and ordered the abandonment of the island.{{sfn|Falk|p=510}}\n\n[[File:\u6c6a\u7cbe\u536b\u89c1\u4e1c\u6761\u82f1\u673a.jpg|thumb|[[Wang Jingwei]] of the Japanese-sponsored [[Wang Jingwei Government|puppet government in Nanjing]] meeting with Tojo in 1942]]\nIn September 1943, the Emperor and Tojo agreed that Japan would pull back to an \"absolute defense line\" in the south-west Pacific to stem the American advance, and considered abandoning Rabaul base, but changed their minds in face of objections from the Navy.{{sfn|Bix|p=467-468}} In November 1943, the American public's reaction to the [[Battle of Tarawa]] led Tojo to view Tarawa as a sort of Japanese victory, believing that more battles like Tarawa would break American morale, and force the U.S. to sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} Moreover, Tojo believed that the Americans would become bogged down in the Marshalls, giving more time to strengthen the defenses in the Marianas.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} In late 1943, with the support of the Emperor, Tojo made a major effort to make peace with China to free up the 2 million Japanese soldiers in China for operations elsewhere, but the unwillingness of the Japanese to give up any of their \"rights and interests\" in China doomed the effort.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} China was by far the largest theater of operations for Japan, and with the Americans steadily advancing in the Pacific, Tojo was anxious to end the quagmire of the \"China affair\" to redeploy Japanese forces.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} In an attempt to enlist support from all of Asia, especially China, Tojo opened the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, which issued a set of Pan-Asian war aims, which made little impression on most Asians.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=498}} On January 9, 1944, Japan signed a treaty with the puppet Wang regime under which Japan gave up its extraterritorial rights in China as part of a bid to win Chinese public opinion over to a pro-Japanese viewpoint, but as the treaty changed nothing in practice, the gambit failed.{{sfn|Bix|pp=473\u2013474}} At the same time as he sought a diplomatic effort to end the war with China, Tojo also approved of the planning for [[Operation Ichi-Go]], a huge offensive against China intended to take the American air bases in China and finally knock China out of the war once and for all.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}} In January 1944, Tojo approved of orders issued by Imperial General Headquarters for an invasion of India, where the Burma Area Army in Burma under General [[Masakazu Kawabe]] was to seize the Manipour and Assam provinces with the aim of cutting off American aid to China (the railroad that supplied the American air bases in north-east India that allowed for supplies to be flown over \"[[the Hump]]\" of the Himalayas to China passed through these provinces).{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=640\u2013641}} Cutting off American aid to China in turn might have the effect of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to sue for peace. Following the 15th Army into India in the U-Go offensive were the Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and his Indian National Army, as the political purpose of the operation was to provoke a general uprising against British rule in India that might allow the Japanese to take all of India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}} The roads necessary to properly supply the 150,000 Japanese soldiers committed to invading India would turn into mud when the monsoons arrived, giving the Japanese a very short period of time to break through. The Japanese were counting on capturing food from the British to feed their army, which in turn was based on the assumption that all of India would rise up when the Japanese arrived, causing the collapse of the Raj.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}}{{sfn|Willmott|pp=155\u2013156}} The Japanese brought along with them enough food to last for only 20 days, and after that, they would have to capture food from the British to avoid starving.{{sfn|Willmott|pp=156\u2013157}} Bose had impressed Tojo at their meetings as the best man to inspire an anti-British revolution in India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}}\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and Nobusuke Kishi in 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d and his minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]], who later became a prime minister in postwar Japan]]\n\nIn the central Pacific, the Americans destroyed the main Japanese naval base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in an [[Operation Hailstone|air raid]] on February 18, 1944, forcing the Imperial Navy back to the Marianas (the oil to fuel ships and planes operating in the Marshalls, Caroline and Gilbert islands went up in smoke at Truk).{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} This breach of the \"absolute defense line\", five months after its creation, led Tojo to fire Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] as the Navy Chief of Staff, for incompetence.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=649}} The Americans had penetrated 1,300 miles across the \"absolute defense line\" and destroyed Truk, which caused a major crisis in Tokyo as Tojo, senior generals and admirals all blamed each other for the situation.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} To strengthen his position in face of criticism of the way the war was going, on February 21, 1944, Tojo assumed the post of Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]], arguing he needed to take personal charge of the Army.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} When [[Hajime Sugiyama|Field Marshal Sugiyama]] complained to the Emperor about being fired and having the Prime Minister run the General Staff, the Emperor told him he supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} Tojo's major concern as Army Chief of Staff was planning the operations in China and India, with less time given over to the coming battles in the Marianas.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}} Tojo decided to take the strategic offensive for 1944 with his plans to win the war in 1944 being as follows:\n* Operation Ichigo would end the war with China, freeing up some 2 million Japanese soldiers.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* Operation U-Go would take India.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* When the Americans made the expected offensive into the Marianas, the Imperial Navy's Combined Fleet would fight a decisive battle of annihilation against the U.S. 5th Fleet, and halt the American drive in the central Pacific.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* In the South-west Pacific, the Japanese forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands would stay on the defensive and try to slow down the American, Australian, and New Zealand forces for long as possible.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}} Knowing of General MacArthur's personal obsession with returning to the Philippines, Tojo expected MacArthur to head for the Philippines rather than the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese-occupied]] [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern Indonesia), which was a relief from the Japanese viewpoint; the Dutch East Indies were rich in oil while the Philippines were not.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\nTojo expected that a major American defeat in the Marianas together with the conquest of China and India would so stun the Americans that they would sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By this point, Tojo no longer believed the war aims of 1942 could be achieved, but he believed that his plans for victory 1944 would lead to a compromise peace that would allow him to present as a victory to the Japanese people.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By serving as Prime Minister, Army Minister and Army Chief of Staff, Tojo was taking on all of the responsibility, and if plans for victory in 1944 failed, he would have no scapegoat.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}}\n\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d inspecting Kuching airfield, 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d inspecting an airfield in Kuching in [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied British Borneo]], July 1943]]\nOn March 12, 1944, the Japanese launched the [[Operation U-Go|U-Go offensive]] and invaded India.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}} Tojo had some doubts about Operation U-Go, but it was ordered by the Emperor himself, and Tojo was unwilling to oppose any decision of the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}}\n\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], Hideki Tojo, [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[Jos\u00e9 P.

On July 5, 1944, the Emperor accepted Tojo's advice to end the invasion of India as 72,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed in battle. A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking, once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}} Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India, most were dead by July 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=642}}\n\nIn parallel with the invasion of India, in April 1944 Tojo began [[Operation Ichi-Go|Operation Ichigo]], the largest Japanese offensive of the entire war, with the aim of taking southern China.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Saipan]], about 70,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in June\u2013July 1944 and in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] the Imperial Navy suffered a crushing defeat.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, June 19, 1944, was dubbed by the Americans \"the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" as over the course of the dogfights in the air, the United States Navy lost 30 planes while shooting down about 350 Imperial Japanese planes, in one of the Imperial Navy's most humiliating defeats.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} The Japanese believed that indoctrination in ''bushido'' (\"the way of the warrior\") would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the Emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die, but superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed by the Americans.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} With Saipan in American hands, the Americans could take other islands in the Marianas to build airbases.{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} The establishment of American bases in the Marianas meant the cities of Japan were within the range of B-29 Superfortress bombers and the British historian H. P. Willmott noted that \"even the most hard-headed of the Japanese militarists could dimly perceive that Japan would be at the end of her tether in that case\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} As the news of the disastrous defeat suffered at Saipan reached Japan, it turned elite opinion against the Tojo government.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The Emperor himself was furious about the defeat at Saipan; had called a meeting of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals to see if were possible to recapture Saipan (it was not); and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary \"he flares up frequently\".{{sfn|Bix|p=477}} Tojo was the Prime Minister, Minister of War and Chief of the Army General Staff, and was seen both in Japan and in the US as, in words of Willmott, \"the embodiment of national determination, hardline nationalism and militarism\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Prince Konoe and Admiral Okada had long been plotting to bring down the Tojo government since the spring of 1943, and their principal problem had been the support of the Emperor, who did not wish to lose his favorite Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Saipan, it was clear to at least some of the Japanese elite that the war was lost, and Japan needed to make peace before the ''[[kokutai]]'' and perhaps even the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] itself was destroyed.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Tojo had been so demonized in the United States during the war that, for the American people, Tojo was the face of Japanese militarism, and it was inconceivable that the United States would make peace with a government headed by Tojo.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Willmott noted that an additional problem for the \"peace faction\" was that: \"Tojo was an embodiment of ''mainstream opinion'' within the nation, the armed services and particularly the Army. Tojo had powerful support, and by Japanese standards, he was not extreme.\"{{sfn|Willmott|pp=216\u2013217}} Tojo was more of a follower than a leader, and he represented mainstream opinion in the Army, and so his removal from office would not mean the end of the political ambitions of an Army still fanatically committed to victory or death.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The ''jushin'' (elder statesmen) had advised the Emperor that Tojo needed to go after Saipan and further advised the Emperor against partial changes in the cabinet, demanding that the entire Tojo cabinet resign.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo, aware of the intrigues to bring him down, had sought the public approval of the Emperor, which was denied, with the Emperor sending him a message to the effect that the man responsible for the disaster of Saipan was not worthy of his approval.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo suggested reorganizing his cabinet to regain Imperial approval, and was rebuffed with the Emperor saying the entire cabinet had to go.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Once it was clear that Tojo no longer had the support of the Chrysanthemum Throne, Tojo's enemies had little trouble bringing down his government.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} The politically powerful Lord Privy Seal, Marquis [[K\u014dichi Kido]] spread the word that the Emperor no longer supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} After the [[fall of Saipan]], he was forced to resign on July 18, 1944.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} The ''jushin'' advised the Emperor to appoint a former Prime Minister, Admiral [[Mitsumasa_Yonai|Mitsumasa Yonai]] as Prime Minister as he was popular with the Navy, the diplomatic corps, the bureaucracy and the \"peace faction\", but Yonai refused to serve, knowing full well that a Prime Minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans might be assassinated as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and regarded any talk of peace as treason.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Admiral Yonai stated that only another general could serve as Prime Minister, and advised General [[Kuniaki_Koiso|Kuniaki Koiso]] should serve as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} At a conference with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai were told by the Emperor to co-operate in forming a government without saying who was to be the new Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} As the Emperor was worshiped as a living god, neither Yonai and Koiso could ask him who was to be the Prime Minister, as one does not ask questions of a god, and after the meeting, both men were very confused as to which of the two was now the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Finally, the Lord Privy Seal, K\u014dichi Kido resolved the muddle by saying Koiso was the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Two days after Tojo resigned, the Emperor gave him an imperial rescript offering him unusually lavish praise for his \"meritorious services and hard work\" and declaring \"Hereafter we expect you to live up to our trust and make even greater contributions to military affairs\".{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\n== Arrest, trial, and execution ==\n[[File:Tojo suicide.jpg|thumb|Hideki Tojo after his attempted suicide during his arrest]]\nAfter [[surrender of Japan|Japan's unconditional surrender]] in 1945, U.S. general [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered the arrest of forty alleged war criminals, including Tojo.

politician and [[general officer|general]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) who served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and President of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] for the majority of [[World War II]]. Before becoming Japan's [[head of government]], Tojo was among the most outspoken proponents for [[preventive war]] against the United States during deliberations leading to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Upon becoming Prime Minister in October 17, 1941, he presided over the conquest of much of the West's territories in Asia and the Pacific until the defeat of Japanese forces at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. During his years in power, he also oversaw the perpetration of numerous war crimes including the systematic massacre and starvation of civilians and [[prisoners of war]]. As the war's tide increasingly turned against Japan, Tojo was forced to resign as Prime Minister on July 22, 1944. After Japan's surrender in September 1945, Tojo was arrested, convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], sentenced to death, and hanged on December 23, 1948.{{sfn|Yenne|p=337}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHideki Tojo was born in the [[K\u014djimachi]] district of [[Tokyo]] on December 30, 1884,{{sfn|Gorman|p=43}} as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army.{{sfn|Butow|p=4}} Under the ''[[bakufu]]'', Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants and the [[samurai]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, ensuring that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}} The Tojo family came from the samurai caste, though the Tojo's were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (lords) that they had served for generations.{{sfn|Browne|p=11}} Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] priest, making his family very respectable, but poor.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}}\n\nHideki had an education typical of a Japanese youth in the Meiji era.{{sfn|Browne|pp=14\u201315, 19\u201320}} The purpose of the Meiji educational system was to train the boys to be soldiers as adults, and the message was relentlessly drilled into Japanese students that war was the most beautiful thing in the entire world, that the Emperor was a living god and that the greatest honor for a Japanese man was to die for the Emperor.{{sfn|Browne|pp=19\u201320}} Japanese girls were taught that the highest honor for a woman was to have as many sons as possible who could die for the Emperor in war. As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, for being an opinionated and combative youth fond of getting into fights with the other boys and for his tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for failure; those who did so were often bullied by the teachers.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo was of average intelligence, but was known to compensate for his limited intelligence with a willingness to work extremely hard.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo's boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who issued the injunction: \"Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo liked to say: \"I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}}\n\n[[File:Young Tojo.JPG|thumb|Young Hideki Tojo]]\nIn 1899, Hideki entered the Army Cadet School. When he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], which ended the [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Russia]], and which the Japanese people saw as a betrayal as the war did not end with Japan annexing [[Siberia]] as popular opinion had demanded.{{sfn|Browne|pp=23\u201324}} The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the [[Hibiya incendiary incident]] as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese at the time had understood that the war with Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}} Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}}\n\nIn 1909, Hideki married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie and Kimie).{{sfn|Baudot|p=455}}<ref>Courtney Browne, ''Tojo: The Last Banzai'', Angus & Robertson, 1967, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In 1918\u201319, Tojo briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Browne|p=27}} Tojo served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919-1922.{{sfn|Browne|p=28}} As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception.{{sfn|Browne|pp=28\u201329}} In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the \"national defense state\". In 1922, on his way home to Japan, Tojo took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic \"soft\" people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying and (despite [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) drinking.{{sfn|Browne|p=29}}\n\nTojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night, and he refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work, having his wife do all the work of taking care of his children.{{sfn|Browne|p=29-30}} A stern, humorless man, Tojo was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders, saying that face-slapping was a \"means of training\" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom ''bushido'' was not second nature.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}}\n\nIn 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Control Act]] passed by the American Congress banning all Asian immigration into the United States with many Congressmen and Senators openly saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Tojo wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals and \"It [the Immigration Control Act] shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world\".{{sfn|Browne|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBy 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, Tojo told his officers that they were to be both a \"father\" and a \"mother\" to the men under their command.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}} Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems and made loans to officers short of money.{{sfn|Browne|pp=40\u201341}} Like many other Japanese officers, Tojo disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the [[Ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]] (\"eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense\") movement as he complained about such forms of \"Western decadence\" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the ''[[kokutai]]''.{{sfn|Browne|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n== Army career ==\n=== As major general ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]\n\nIn 1934, Hideki was promoted to [[major general]] and served as Chief of the Personnel Department within the [[Minister of War of Japan|Army Ministry]].{{sfn|Fredrikson|p=507}} Tojo wrote a chapter in the book ''Hij\u014dji kokumin zensh\u016b'' (''Essays in time of national emergency''), a book published in March 1934 by the Army Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian \"national defense state\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} This book of 15 essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904\u201305 because ''bushid\u014d'' had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war (against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese war on a much greater scale by creating the \"national defense state\" that would mobilize the entire nation for war.{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} In his essay Tojo wrote \"The modern war of national defense extends over a great many areas\" requiring \"a state that can monolithically control\" all aspects of the nation in the political, social and economic spheres.{{sfn|Bix|pp=277\u2013278}} Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States for waging \"ideological war\" against Japan since 1919.{{sfn|Bix|p=278}} Tojo ended his essay stating that Japan must stand tall \"and spread its own moral principles to the world\" as the \"cultural and ideological war of the 'imperial way' is about to begin\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}}\n\nTojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934.{{sfn|Lamont-Brown|p=65}} In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the [[Kenpeitai]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]]. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed {{nihongo|\"Razor\"|\u30ab\u30df\u30bd\u30ea|Kamisori}}, for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the ''[[T\u014dseiha]]'' (\"Control\") faction in the Army that was opposed by the more radical ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' (\"Imperial Way\") faction.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} Both the ''T\u014dseiha'' and the ''K\u014dd\u014dha'' factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving these goals.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Imperial Way faction wanted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to achieve a [[Sh\u014dwa Restoration]]; emphasised \"spirit\" as the principle war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Control faction, while being willing to use assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; wanted to create the \"national defense state\" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war; and, while not rejecting the idea of \"spirit\" as a war-winning factor also saw military modernization as a war-winning factor; and saw the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}}\n\nDuring the [[February 26 Incident|February 26 coup attempt]] of 1936, Tojo and [[Shigeru Honj\u014d]], a noted supporter of [[Sadao Araki]], both opposed the rebels who were associated with the rival \"Imperial Way\" faction.{{sfn|Takemae & Ricketts|p=221}} Emperor [[Hirohito]] himself was outraged at the attacks on his close advisers, and after a brief political crisis and stalling on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander of the ''Kenpeitai'', Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo.{{sfn|Browne|p=59}} In the aftermath, the T\u014dseiha faction was able to purge the Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. Following the purge, T\u014dseiha and K\u014dd\u014dha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political stance under the banner of the T\u014dseiha military clique, with Tojo in the leadership position.\n\nTojo was promoted to [[chief of staff (military)|Chief of staff]] of the Kwangtung Army in 1937.{{sfn|Dear & Foot|p=872}} As the \"[[Manchukuo|Empire of Manchukuo]]\" was, in reality, a Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army's duties were just as much political as they were military.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} During this period, Tojo become close to [[Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka]], the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the [[South Manchuria Railway]], one of Asia's largest corporations at the time, and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], the Deputy Minister of Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man ''de facto'' in charge of Manchukuo's economy.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war with the Soviet Union as his first duty, Tojo also supported the forward policy in north China as the Japanese sought to extend their influence into China.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the [[Inner Mongolia]] border regions with [[Manchukuo]]. In July 1937, he personally led the units of the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade in [[Operation Chahar]], his only real combat experience.{{sfn|Cowley & Parker|p=473}}\n\nAfter the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] marking the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Tojo ordered his forces to attack [[Hebei Province]] and other targets in northern China. Tojo received [[Jew]]ish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected the resulting Nazi German protests.{{sfn|Goodman & Miyazawa|p=113}} Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as Vice-Minister of War under [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]].{{sfn|Kato|p=127}} From December 1938 to 1940, Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.{{sfn|''The New International Year Book''|p=320}}\n\n== Political career ==\n=== Rise to Prime Minister ===\nOn June 1, 1940, the Showa Emperor appointed [[K\u014dichi Kido]], a leading \"reform bureaucrat\" as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor's leading political advisor and fixer.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between the \"reform bureaucrats\" and the \"Control\" faction in the Army, which was headed by General Mut\u014d Akira and General Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido's appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction.{{sfn|Bix|pp=370\u2013371}} On July 30, 1940, Hideki Tojo was appointed Army Minister in the second [[Fumimaro Konoe]] regime and remained in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo\u2014a man representative of both the Army's hardline views and the Control faction while being considered reasonable to deal with\u2014to secure the Army's backing for his foreign policy.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist, well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork, who believed that the Emperor was a living god and favored \"direct imperial rule\", ensuring that he would faithfully follow any order from the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, seeking better relations with both Germany and the United States, and of taking advantage of the changes in the international order caused by Germany's victories in the spring of 1940 to make Japan a stronger power in Asia.{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}} Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a ''modus vivendi'' with the United States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the \"[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]\".{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nBy 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, no longer believed that a military solution to the \"China Affair\" was possible as he once did, instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had outlined in the \"Konoe programme\" of January 1938.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} For this reason, Konoe wanted Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide \"cover\" for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a strong supporter of the [[Tripartite Pact]] between Imperial Japan, [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]]. As the Army Minister, he continued to expand the war with China.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After negotiations with [[Vichy France]], Japan was given permission to place its troops in the southern part of [[French Indochina]] in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing [[economic sanctions]] in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports.{{sfn|Toland|p={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} On September 6, a deadline of early October was fixed in the [[Gozen Kaigi|Imperial Conference]] for resolving the situation diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress. Prime Minister Konoe then held his last cabinet meeting, where Tojo did most of the talking:\n\n{{quote |\nFor the past six months, ever since April, the foreign minister has made painstaking efforts to adjust relations. Although I respect him for that, we remain deadlocked&nbsp;... The heart of the matter is the imposition on us of withdrawal from Indochina and China&nbsp;... If we yield to America's demands, it will destroy the fruits of the China incident. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea undermined.{{sfn|Bix|p=417}}\n}}\n\nThe prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, although the Emperor himself was skeptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to [[K\u014dichi Kido]]: \"There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war.\"{{sfn|Kido|p=914}} During the last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the Americans as arrogant, bullying white supremacists. He said that any compromise solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which case Japan might be better to choose war to uphold national honor.{{sfn|Bix|pp=417\u2013418}} Despite saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten the ''kokutai''; the \"China Incident\" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.{{sfn|Bix|p=416}}\n\nOn October 16, Konoe, politically isolated and convinced that the Emperor no longer trusted him, resigned. Later, he justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita:\n\n{{quote |\nOf course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war is a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward war. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: \"My prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more.\" In short, the Emperor had absorbed the views of the army and navy high commands.{{sfn|Fujiwara|p=126}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Tojo2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hideki Tojo in military uniform]]\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing cropped2.png|170px|thumb]]\nAt the time, [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]] was said to be the only person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by Konoe and Tojo as Konoe's replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the prestige of the House of Yamato.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} Following the advice of K\u014dichi Kido, he chose instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}}{{sfn|Terasaki|p=118}} Tojo's first speech on the radio made a call for \"world peace\", but also stated his determination to settle the \"China Affair\" on Japanese terms and to achieve the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.{{sfn|Browne|p=107}} Tojo was known to advocate war with the United States, and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary about hearing of the appointment: \"We have finally committed to war and now must do all we can to launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. We needn't have signaled what we're going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort war will begin.\"{{sfn|Bix|p=419}} The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo took office.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} During the meetings of the senior statesmen to decide who was to succeed Prince Konoe, the former Prime Minister Admiral [[Keisuke Okada]] was opposed to Tojo as Prime Minister, while the powerful Lord Privy Seal [[K\u014dichi Kido]] pushed for Tojo, leading a compromise where Tojo would become Prime Minister while \"re-examining\" the options for dealing with the crisis with the United States, though Kido did not say that Tojo would attempt to avoid a war.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}} By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen before appointing a prime minister, and as long as Admiral Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}}\n\nTojo wrote in his diary: \"I thought I was summoned because the Emperor was angry at my opinion.\" He was given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.{{sfn|Bix|p=418-419}} Tojo, who was on the side of war, nevertheless accepted this order, and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, a member of the Army General Staff, the Prime Minister showed a true sense of loyalty to the emperor performing this duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for the Prime Minister for his audience with the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: \"If the Emperor said it should be so, then that's it for me. One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.\"{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff [[Hajime Sugiyama]] and [[Osami Nagano]] reported to Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=47\u201350}}{{sfn|Bix|p=421}} The next day, Fleet Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=29, 35}} The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers that Japanese defense perimeter lines\u2014operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting heavy Western casualties\u2014could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to be prepared to return to Japan on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Two days later, on November 5, Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings with the military and Tojo until the end of the month. On November 26, 1941, the American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] handed Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington a \"draft mutual declaration of policy\" and \"Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan\".{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} Hull proposed that Japan \"withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces\" from China and French Indochina in exchange for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The \"[[Hull note]]\" as it is known in Japan made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei as the government of China, but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the \"Empire of Manchukuo\"{{Opinion|date=April 2019}} and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal from China.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the \"Hull note\" to the Cabinet as an \"ultimatum to Japan\", which was incorrect as the \"Hull note\" did not have a timeline for its acceptance and was marked \"tentative\" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The claim that the Americans had demanded in the \"Hull note\" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, instead of just the parts occupied since 1937 and together with the claim the note was an ultimatum was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States.{{sfn|Bix|p=428-431}} On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the \"war against the United States, England, and the Netherlands\".{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=28\u201330, 39}}\n\n=== As Prime Minister ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo lands in Manila.jpg|thumb|Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo landed in [[Nichols Field]], an airfield south of Manila, for a state visit to the Philippines.]]\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Tojo went on Japanese radio to announce that Japan was now at war with the United States, the British Empire and the Netherlands, reading out an Imperial Rescript that ended with the playing of the popular martial song ''[[Umi Yukaba]]'' (''Across the Sea''), which set to music a popular war poem from the classic collection ''[[Many\u014dsh\u016b]]'', featuring the lyrics \"Across the sea, corpses soaking in the water, Across the mountains corpses heaped up in the grass, We shall die by the side of our lord, We shall never look back\".{{sfn|Dower|p=25}} Tojo continued to hold the position of Army Minister during his term as Prime Minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944.

In March 1942, Tojo in his capacity as Army Minister gave permission for the Japanese Army in Taiwan to ship 50 \"[[comfort women]]\" from Taiwan to Borneo without ID papers (his approval was necessary as the Army's rules forbade people without ID traveling to the new conquests).{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} The Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi noted this document proves that Tojo was aware of and approved of the \"comfort women\" corps.{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} On April 18, 1942, the Americans staged the [[Doolittle Raid]], bombing Tokyo.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} Some of the American planes were shot down and their pilots taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The Army General Staff led by Field Marshal [[Hajime Sugiyama]] insisted on executing the eight American fliers, but were opposed by Tojo, who feared that the Americans would retaliate against Japanese POWs if the Doolittle fliers were executed.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The dispute was resolved by the Emperor who commuted the death sentences of five fliers while allowing the other three to die, for reasons that remain unclear as the documents relating to the Emperor's intervention were burned in 1945.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}}\n\nAs the Japanese went from victory to victory, Tojo and the rest of the Japanese elite were gripped by what the Japanese called \"[[victory disease]]\" as the entire elite was caught up in a state of hubris, believing Japan was invincible and the war was as good as won.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} By May 1942, Tojo approved a set of \"non-negotiable\" demands to be presented once the Allies sued for peace that allowed Japan to keep everything it already conquered while assuming possession of considerably more. {{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} Under such demands, Japan would assume control of the following territories:\n*the British Crown colonies of India and Honduras well as the British dominions of Australia, Australian New Guinea, Ceylon, New Zealand, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory \n*the American state of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii\n*most of Latin America including Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the rest of the West Indies.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} \n\nAdditionally, Tojo wanted all of China to be under the rule of the puppet [[Wang Jingwei]], planned to buy Macau and East Timor from Portugal and to create new puppet kingdoms in Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaya.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=329\u2013330}} As the Burmese had proved to be enthusiastic collaborators in the \"New Order in Asia\", the new Burmese kingdom would be allowed to annex much of north-east India as a reward.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}} The Navy for its part demanded that Japan take New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}}\n\nWhile Tojo was prime minister, the main forum for military decision-making was the Imperial General Headquarters presided over by the Emperor. It consisted of the Army and Navy ministers; the Army and Navy chiefs of staff; and chiefs of the military affairs bureaus in both services.{{sfn|Falk|p=511}} The Imperial GHQ was not a joint chiefs of staff as existed in the United States and United Kingdom, but rather two separate services command operating under the same roof who would meet about twice a week to attempt to agree on a common strategy.{{sfn|Falk|pp=511\u2013512}} The Operations Bureaus of the Army and Navy would develop their own plans and then attempt to \"sell them\" to the other, which was often not possible.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} Tojo was one voice out of many speaking at the Imperial GHQ, and was not able to impose his will on the Navy, which he had to negotiate with, like he was dealing with an ally.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} The American historian Stanley Falk described the Japanese system as characterized by \"bitter inter-service antagonisms\" as the Army and Navy worked \"at cross-purposes\", observing the Japanese system of command was \"uncoordinated, ill-defined and inefficient\".{{sfn|Falk|p=518}}\n\n[[File:Cabinet of Hideki Tojo 3.jpg|thumb|Cabinet ministers of the first Tojo Cabinet, October 1941]]\nHowever, after the [[Battle of Midway]], with the tide of war turning against Japan, Tojo faced increasing opposition from within the government and military. In August\u2013September 1942, a major crisis gripped the Tojo cabinet when the Foreign Minister [[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]] objected quite violently on August 29, 1942 to the Prime Minister's plan to establish a Greater East Asia Ministry to handle relations with the puppet regimes in Asia as an insult to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the ''Gaimusho'') and threatened to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} Tojo went to see the Emperor, who backed the Prime Minister's plans for the Greater East Asia Ministry, and on September 1, 1942 Tojo told the cabinet he was establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry and could not care less about how the ''Gaimusho'' felt about the issue, leading T\u014dg\u014d to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} The American historian Herbert Bix wrote that Tojo was a \"dictator\" only in the narrow sense that from September 1942 on, he was generally able to impose his will on the Cabinet without seeking a consensus, but at same time noted that Tojo's authority was based upon the support of the Emperor, who held ultimate power.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} In November 1942, Tojo, as Army Minister, was involved in drafting the regulations for taking \"comfort women\" from China, Japan (which included Taiwan and Korea at this time) and Manchukuo to the \"South\", as the Japanese called their conquests in South-East Asia, to ensure that the \"comfort women\" had the proper papers before departing. Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take \"comfort women\" without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests.{{sfn|Yoshimi|p=83}} At the same time, Tojo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not. Tojo sacked the Operations office and his deputy at the general staff, who were opposed to withdrawing, and ordered the abandonment of the island.{{sfn|Falk|p=510}}\n\n[[File:\u6c6a\u7cbe\u536b\u89c1\u4e1c\u6761\u82f1\u673a.jpg|thumb|[[Wang Jingwei]] of the Japanese-sponsored [[Wang Jingwei Government|puppet government in Nanjing]] meeting with Tojo in 1942]]\nIn September 1943, the Emperor and Tojo agreed that Japan would pull back to an \"absolute defense line\" in the south-west Pacific to stem the American advance, and considered abandoning Rabaul base, but changed their minds in face of objections from the Navy.{{sfn|Bix|p=467-468}} In November 1943, the American public's reaction to the [[Battle of Tarawa]] led Tojo to view Tarawa as a sort of Japanese victory, believing that more battles like Tarawa would break American morale, and force the U.S. to sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} Moreover, Tojo believed that the Americans would become bogged down in the Marshalls, giving more time to strengthen the defenses in the Marianas.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} In late 1943, with the support of the Emperor, Tojo made a major effort to make peace with China to free up the 2 million Japanese soldiers in China for operations elsewhere, but the unwillingness of the Japanese to give up any of their \"rights and interests\" in China doomed the effort.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} China was by far the largest theater of operations for Japan, and with the Americans steadily advancing in the Pacific, Tojo was anxious to end the quagmire of the \"China affair\" to redeploy Japanese forces.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} In an attempt to enlist support from all of Asia, especially China, Tojo opened the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, which issued a set of Pan-Asian war aims, which made little impression on most Asians.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=498}} On January 9, 1944, Japan signed a treaty with the puppet Wang regime under which Japan gave up its extraterritorial rights in China as part of a bid to win Chinese public opinion over to a pro-Japanese viewpoint, but as the treaty changed nothing in practice, the gambit failed.{{sfn|Bix|pp=473\u2013474}} At the same time as he sought a diplomatic effort to end the war with China, Tojo also approved of the planning for [[Operation Ichi-Go]], a huge offensive against China intended to take the American air bases in China and finally knock China out of the war once and for all.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}} In January 1944, Tojo approved of orders issued by Imperial General Headquarters for an invasion of India, where the Burma Area Army in Burma under General [[Masakazu Kawabe]] was to seize the Manipour and Assam provinces with the aim of cutting off American aid to China (the railroad that supplied the American air bases in north-east India that allowed for supplies to be flown over \"[[the Hump]]\" of the Himalayas to China passed through these provinces).{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=640\u2013641}} Cutting off American aid to China in turn might have the effect of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to sue for peace. Following the 15th Army into India in the U-Go offensive were the Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and his Indian National Army, as the political purpose of the operation was to provoke a general uprising against British rule in India that might allow the Japanese to take all of India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}} The roads necessary to properly supply the 150,000 Japanese soldiers committed to invading India would turn into mud when the monsoons arrived, giving the Japanese a very short period of time to break through. The Japanese were counting on capturing food from the British to feed their army, which in turn was based on the assumption that all of India would rise up when the Japanese arrived, causing the collapse of the Raj.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}}{{sfn|Willmott|pp=155\u2013156}} The Japanese brought along with them enough food to last for only 20 days, and after that, they would have to capture food from the British to avoid starving.{{sfn|Willmott|pp=156\u2013157}} Bose had impressed Tojo at their meetings as the best man to inspire an anti-British revolution in India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}}\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and Nobusuke Kishi in 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d and his minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]], who later became a prime minister in postwar Japan]]\n\nIn the central Pacific, the Americans destroyed the main Japanese naval base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in an [[Operation Hailstone|air raid]] on February 18, 1944, forcing the Imperial Navy back to the Marianas (the oil to fuel ships and planes operating in the Marshalls, Caroline and Gilbert islands went up in smoke at Truk).{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} This breach of the \"absolute defense line\", five months after its creation, led Tojo to fire Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] as the Navy Chief of Staff, for incompetence.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=649}} The Americans had penetrated 1,300 miles across the \"absolute defense line\" and destroyed Truk, which caused a major crisis in Tokyo as Tojo, senior generals and admirals all blamed each other for the situation.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} To strengthen his position in face of criticism of the way the war was going, on February 21, 1944, Tojo assumed the post of Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]], arguing he needed to take personal charge of the Army.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} When [[Hajime Sugiyama|Field Marshal Sugiyama]] complained to the Emperor about being fired and having the Prime Minister run the General Staff, the Emperor told him he supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} Tojo's major concern as Army Chief of Staff was planning the operations in China and India, with less time given over to the coming battles in the Marianas.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}} Tojo decided to take the strategic offensive for 1944 with his plans to win the war in 1944 being as follows:\n* Operation Ichigo would end the war with China, freeing up some 2 million Japanese soldiers.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* Operation U-Go would take India.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* When the Americans made the expected offensive into the Marianas, the Imperial Navy's Combined Fleet would fight a decisive battle of annihilation against the U.S. 5th Fleet, and halt the American drive in the central Pacific.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* In the South-west Pacific, the Japanese forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands would stay on the defensive and try to slow down the American, Australian, and New Zealand forces for long as possible.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}} Knowing of General MacArthur's personal obsession with returning to the Philippines, Tojo expected MacArthur to head for the Philippines rather than the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese-occupied]] [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern Indonesia), which was a relief from the Japanese viewpoint; the Dutch East Indies were rich in oil while the Philippines were not.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\nTojo expected that a major American defeat in the Marianas together with the conquest of China and India would so stun the Americans that they would sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By this point, Tojo no longer believed the war aims of 1942 could be achieved, but he believed that his plans for victory 1944 would lead to a compromise peace that would allow him to present as a victory to the Japanese people.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By serving as Prime Minister, Army Minister and Army Chief of Staff, Tojo was taking on all of the responsibility, and if plans for victory in 1944 failed, he would have no scapegoat.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}}\n\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d inspecting Kuching airfield, 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d inspecting an airfield in Kuching in [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied British Borneo]], July 1943]]\nOn March 12, 1944, the Japanese launched the [[Operation U-Go|U-Go offensive]] and invaded India.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}} Tojo had some doubts about Operation U-Go, but it was ordered by the Emperor himself, and Tojo was unwilling to oppose any decision of the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}}\n\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], Hideki Tojo, [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[Jos\u00e9 P.

On July 5, 1944, the Emperor accepted Tojo's advice to end the invasion of India as 72,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed in battle. A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking, once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}} Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India, most were dead by July 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=642}}\n\nIn parallel with the invasion of India, in April 1944 Tojo began [[Operation Ichi-Go|Operation Ichigo]], the largest Japanese offensive of the entire war, with the aim of taking southern China.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Saipan]], about 70,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in June\u2013July 1944 and in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] the Imperial Navy suffered a crushing defeat.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, June 19, 1944, was dubbed by the Americans \"the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" as over the course of the dogfights in the air, the United States Navy lost 30 planes while shooting down about 350 Imperial Japanese planes, in one of the Imperial Navy's most humiliating defeats.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} The Japanese believed that indoctrination in ''bushido'' (\"the way of the warrior\") would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the Emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die, but superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed by the Americans.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} With Saipan in American hands, the Americans could take other islands in the Marianas to build airbases.{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} The establishment of American bases in the Marianas meant the cities of Japan were within the range of B-29 Superfortress bombers and the British historian H. P. Willmott noted that \"even the most hard-headed of the Japanese militarists could dimly perceive that Japan would be at the end of her tether in that case\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} As the news of the disastrous defeat suffered at Saipan reached Japan, it turned elite opinion against the Tojo government.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The Emperor himself was furious about the defeat at Saipan; had called a meeting of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals to see if were possible to recapture Saipan (it was not); and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary \"he flares up frequently\".{{sfn|Bix|p=477}} Tojo was the Prime Minister, Minister of War and Chief of the Army General Staff, and was seen both in Japan and in the US as, in words of Willmott, \"the embodiment of national determination, hardline nationalism and militarism\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Prince Konoe and Admiral Okada had long been plotting to bring down the Tojo government since the spring of 1943, and their principal problem had been the support of the Emperor, who did not wish to lose his favorite Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Saipan, it was clear to at least some of the Japanese elite that the war was lost, and Japan needed to make peace before the ''[[kokutai]]'' and perhaps even the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] itself was destroyed.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Tojo had been so demonized in the United States during the war that, for the American people, Tojo was the face of Japanese militarism, and it was inconceivable that the United States would make peace with a government headed by Tojo.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Willmott noted that an additional problem for the \"peace faction\" was that: \"Tojo was an embodiment of ''mainstream opinion'' within the nation, the armed services and particularly the Army. Tojo had powerful support, and by Japanese standards, he was not extreme.\"{{sfn|Willmott|pp=216\u2013217}} Tojo was more of a follower than a leader, and he represented mainstream opinion in the Army, and so his removal from office would not mean the end of the political ambitions of an Army still fanatically committed to victory or death.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The ''jushin'' (elder statesmen) had advised the Emperor that Tojo needed to go after Saipan and further advised the Emperor against partial changes in the cabinet, demanding that the entire Tojo cabinet resign.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo, aware of the intrigues to bring him down, had sought the public approval of the Emperor, which was denied, with the Emperor sending him a message to the effect that the man responsible for the disaster of Saipan was not worthy of his approval.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo suggested reorganizing his cabinet to regain Imperial approval, and was rebuffed with the Emperor saying the entire cabinet had to go.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Once it was clear that Tojo no longer had the support of the Chrysanthemum Throne, Tojo's enemies had little trouble bringing down his government.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} The politically powerful Lord Privy Seal, Marquis [[K\u014dichi Kido]] spread the word that the Emperor no longer supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} After the [[fall of Saipan]], he was forced to resign on July 18, 1944.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} The ''jushin'' advised the Emperor to appoint a former Prime Minister, Admiral [[Mitsumasa_Yonai|Mitsumasa Yonai]] as Prime Minister as he was popular with the Navy, the diplomatic corps, the bureaucracy and the \"peace faction\", but Yonai refused to serve, knowing full well that a Prime Minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans might be assassinated as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and regarded any talk of peace as treason.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Admiral Yonai stated that only another general could serve as Prime Minister, and advised General [[Kuniaki_Koiso|Kuniaki Koiso]] should serve as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} At a conference with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai were told by the Emperor to co-operate in forming a government without saying who was to be the new Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} As the Emperor was worshiped as a living god, neither Yonai and Koiso could ask him who was to be the Prime Minister, as one does not ask questions of a god, and after the meeting, both men were very confused as to which of the two was now the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Finally, the Lord Privy Seal, K\u014dichi Kido resolved the muddle by saying Koiso was the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Two days after Tojo resigned, the Emperor gave him an imperial rescript offering him unusually lavish praise for his \"meritorious services and hard work\" and declaring \"Hereafter we expect you to live up to our trust and make even greater contributions to military affairs\".{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\n== Arrest, trial, and execution ==\n[[File:Tojo suicide.jpg|thumb|Hideki Tojo after his attempted suicide during his arrest]]\nAfter [[surrender of Japan|Japan's unconditional surrender]] in 1945, U.S. general [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered the arrest of forty alleged war criminals, including Tojo.

The oil fields are located in the Amazon basin, headquartered at [[Lago Agrio]]; some of the rainforest has been seriously damaged in this region and environmental degradation is severe, with catastrophic oil pollution in some areas. Some 38% of Ecuador's land is forested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Ecuador.htm |title=Ecuador Forest Information and Data |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> and despite a 1.5% annual deforestation rate remains one of the most [[biodiversity|biodiverse]] locations on the planet. The Oriente is also home to a large number of Ecuador's indigenous groups, notably the lowland [[Quechuas|Quechua]], [[Siona people|Siona]], [[Secoya people|Secoya]], [[Huaorani]], and [[Cof\u00e1n]].\n[[File:Andes Mountains South America Photograph 022.JPG|thumb|Imbabura Volcano photographed in black and white.]]\n\n== Drainage ==\n\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n\n[[Image:Ecuador Pastazas near Banos.JPG|thumb|left|Pastazas river near Ba\u00f1os, Ecuador]]\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador rise in the Sierra region and flow east toward the Amazon River or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the Andes to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\nIn the Costa region, the Costa Externa has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the Costa Externa from the Costa Internal and the Sierra on their way to the Pacific Ocean. The Costa Internal, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nThe Guayas River system, which flows southward to the Gulf of Guayaquil, constitutes the most important of the drainage systems in the Costa Internal. The Guayas River Basin, including land drained by its tributaries, is 40,000 square kilometers in area. The sixty-kilometer-long Guayas River forms just north of Guayaquil out of the confluence of the Babahoyo and Daule rivers. Briefly constricted at Guayaquil by hills, the Guayas widens south of the city and flows through a deltaic network of small islands and channels. At its mouth, the river forms a broad estuary with two channels around Pun\u00e1 Island, the deeper of which is used for navigation.\n\nThe second major Costa river system\u2014the Esmeraldas\u2014rises in the Hoya de Quito in the Sierra as the Guayllabamba River and flows westward to empty into the Pacific Ocean near the city of Esmeraldas. The Esmeraldas River is 320 kilometers long and has a 20,000-square-kilometer drainage basin.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at sixty-one meters is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the Eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 meters. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the Amazon River. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs.\n\n== Climate ==\n\n{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map ECU present.svg|thumb|300px|Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Ecuador ParamosnearAmbato.JPG|thumb|Paramo meadows near Ambato, Ecuador]]\n\nEach region has different factors that affect its climate. The Costa is influenced primarily by proximity to warm or cool ocean currents. By contrast, climate in the Sierra varies more as a function of altitude. The Oriente has a fairly uniform climate that varies only slightly between the two subregions. Climate in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is both moderated by the ocean currents and affected by altitude. Throughout Ecuador variation in rainfall primarily determines seasons. Temperature is determined by altitude. With each ascent of {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in altitude, temperature drops {{convert|1|C-change}}. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the Sierra.\n\n=== The Sierra ===\n\nTemperatures in the Sierra do not vary greatly on a seasonal basis; the hottest month averages {{convert|16|\u00b0C|1}} and the coolest month, {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} in the upper elevations. Diurnal temperatures, however, vary dramatically, from cold mornings to hot afternoons. The almost vertical sun and the rarefied air in the higher Sierra region allow the land to warm quickly during the day and lose heat quickly at night. Mornings typically are bright and sunny, whereas afternoons often are cloudy and rainy. In general, rainfall amounts are highest on exposed locations at lower altitudes. Rain can also vary on a local basis. Sheltered valleys normally receive {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year, whereas annual rainfall is {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in Quito and can reach {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} on exposed slopes that catch rain-bearing winds. On a seasonal basis, the driest months are June through September.\n\nThe climate in the Sierra is divided into levels based on altitude. The tropical level\u2014{{convert|400|to|1800|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures ranging from {{convert|20|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and heavy precipitation. The subtropical level\u2014{{convert|1800|to|2500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures from {{convert|15|to|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and moderate precipitation. The temperate level\u2014\u2264{{convert|2500|to|3200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2265- -has a year-round temperature in the range of {{convert|10|to|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and an annual rainfall of {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The temperate level experiences rainstorms, hailstorms, and fog. Winter, or the rainy season, lasts from January through June, and the dry season or summer from July through December. Most rain falls in April. There also is a short rainy period in early October caused by moisture penetrating the Sierra from the Oriente. Quito and most other populated areas in the Sierra are located at this temperate level. The cold level extends from the temperate zone to {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Here, average temperatures are {{convert|3|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the precipitation often appears in the form of rain, hail, and thick fog. Above {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is the frozen level, where peaks are constantly capped with snow and ice, and temperatures range from below {{convert|0|to|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Precipitation frequently is in the form of snow, fog, and rain.\n\n=== The Oriente/Amazon Basin ===\n\nThe eastern lowlands in the Oriente experience abundant rainfall, especially in the Andean Piedmont, sometimes exceeding {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Temperatures average {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} in the western parts of this region. The jungle-covered plains of the Eastern lowlands register high levels of rainfall and temperatures surpassing {{convert|28|\u00b0C|1}}.\n\nBeing located on the equator, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands would have an equatorial climate were it not for the modifying effects of the [[Humboldt Current|Peruvian Current]]. Instead, climate on the islands follows a pattern more like that of the Sierra than the Costa. At sea level, the land is desertlike with temperatures of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}}. The eight summer months experience no precipitation, whereas the winter months of January through April have some fog and drizzle. Above sea level to an altitude of {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, the islands have a mixture of tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates. In general, temperatures are around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}}. There is constant fog and drizzle in the summer and rain in the winter. The cold level above {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}} has temperatures below {{convert|14|\u00b0C|1}}.

The most important east-west road across the Andes is the road from Quito to Lago Agrio, which is paved for most of its length yet is heavily traveled by tractor-trailers\u2014and the Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline serves as the guardrail for long stretches of this road.\n\n==== Notable Mountains and Volcanoes ====\n{{Volcanoes in Ecuador}}\n[[Image:Ecuador Chimborazo fromnorthwest.JPG|right|thumb|The volcano Chimborazo from the Northwest]]\n\n* [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] (6,267 m) inactive volcano, the furthest point from the Earth's center.\n* [[Cotopaxi]] (5,897 m) is the tallest active volcano in the world.\n* [[Illiniza]] \t(5,248 m)\n* [[Tungurahua]] (5,023 m) It is an active volcano in eruption since 1998 near Ba\u00f1os-Tunguragua\n* [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]] (4,784 m) volcano overlooking Quito\n\nPartial, incomplete table of volcanoes in the north of the Ecuadorian Andes, from north to south:\n{| border cellspacing=0\n|-\n| West || Interandean || Center || East\n|-\n| Chiles<br />[[Yanaurcu (Ecuador)|Yanaurcu]]<br />[[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]]<br />[[Atacazo]]<br />[[Coraz\u00f3n (volcano)|Coraz\u00f3n]]<br />[[Carihuairazo]]<br />[[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] || [[Imbabura Volcano|Imbabura]]<br />[[Mojanda]]<br />Ilal\u00f3<br />[[Pasochoa]]<br />[[Rumi\u00f1ahui (volcano)|Rumi\u00f1ahui]]<br /> || [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]]<br />Saraurcu<br />Pambamarca<br />Filocorrales<br />[[Antisana]]<br />[[Sincholagua Volcano|Sincholahua]]<br />[[Cotopaxi]]<br />[[Tungurahua]]<br />[[El Altar|Altar]]|| [[Soche]]<br />[[Sumaco]]<br />[[Reventador]]<br />[[Sangay]]\n|}\n\n=== El Oriente (the East) Amazon Basin ===\n\nMuch of the Oriente is [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] (Spanish: ''la selva''), on the east slopes of the [[Andes]] Mountains and descending into the [[Amazon Basin]], with strikingly different upland rainforest with steep, rugged ridges and cascading streams (can be seen around [[Puyo, Pastaza|Puyo]]) and lowland rainforest. The oil fields are located in the Amazon basin, headquartered at [[Lago Agrio]]; some of the rainforest has been seriously damaged in this region and environmental degradation is severe, with catastrophic oil pollution in some areas. Some 38% of Ecuador's land is forested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Ecuador.htm |title=Ecuador Forest Information and Data |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> and despite a 1.5% annual deforestation rate remains one of the most [[biodiversity|biodiverse]] locations on the planet. The Oriente is also home to a large number of Ecuador's indigenous groups, notably the lowland [[Quechuas|Quechua]], [[Siona people|Siona]], [[Secoya people|Secoya]], [[Huaorani]], and [[Cof\u00e1n]].\n[[File:Andes Mountains South America Photograph 022.JPG|thumb|Imbabura Volcano photographed in black and white.]]\n\n== Drainage ==\n\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n\n[[Image:Ecuador Pastazas near Banos.JPG|thumb|left|Pastazas river near Ba\u00f1os, Ecuador]]\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador rise in the Sierra region and flow east toward the Amazon River or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the Andes to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\nIn the Costa region, the Costa Externa has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the Costa Externa from the Costa Internal and the Sierra on their way to the Pacific Ocean. The Costa Internal, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nThe Guayas River system, which flows southward to the Gulf of Guayaquil, constitutes the most important of the drainage systems in the Costa Internal. The Guayas River Basin, including land drained by its tributaries, is 40,000 square kilometers in area. The sixty-kilometer-long Guayas River forms just north of Guayaquil out of the confluence of the Babahoyo and Daule rivers. Briefly constricted at Guayaquil by hills, the Guayas widens south of the city and flows through a deltaic network of small islands and channels. At its mouth, the river forms a broad estuary with two channels around Pun\u00e1 Island, the deeper of which is used for navigation.\n\nThe second major Costa river system\u2014the Esmeraldas\u2014rises in the Hoya de Quito in the Sierra as the Guayllabamba River and flows westward to empty into the Pacific Ocean near the city of Esmeraldas. The Esmeraldas River is 320 kilometers long and has a 20,000-square-kilometer drainage basin.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at sixty-one meters is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the Eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 meters. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the Amazon River. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs.\n\n== Climate ==\n\n{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map ECU present.svg|thumb|300px|Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones]]\n[[Image:Ecuador ParamosnearAmbato.JPG|thumb|Paramo meadows near Ambato, Ecuador]]\n\nEach region has different factors that affect its climate. The Costa is influenced primarily by proximity to warm or cool ocean currents. By contrast, climate in the Sierra varies more as a function of altitude. The Oriente has a fairly uniform climate that varies only slightly between the two subregions. Climate in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is both moderated by the ocean currents and affected by altitude. Throughout Ecuador variation in rainfall primarily determines seasons. Temperature is determined by altitude. With each ascent of {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in altitude, temperature drops {{convert|1|C-change}}. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the Sierra.\n\n=== The Sierra ===\n\nTemperatures in the Sierra do not vary greatly on a seasonal basis; the hottest month averages {{convert|16|\u00b0C|1}} and the coolest month, {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} in the upper elevations. Diurnal temperatures, however, vary dramatically, from cold mornings to hot afternoons. The almost vertical sun and the rarefied air in the higher Sierra region allow the land to warm quickly during the day and lose heat quickly at night. Mornings typically are bright and sunny, whereas afternoons often are cloudy and rainy. In general, rainfall amounts are highest on exposed locations at lower altitudes. Rain can also vary on a local basis. Sheltered valleys normally receive {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year, whereas annual rainfall is {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in Quito and can reach {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} on exposed slopes that catch rain-bearing winds. On a seasonal basis, the driest months are June through September.\n\nThe climate in the Sierra is divided into levels based on altitude. The tropical level\u2014{{convert|400|to|1800|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures ranging from {{convert|20|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and heavy precipitation. The subtropical level\u2014{{convert|1800|to|2500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures from {{convert|15|to|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and moderate precipitation. The temperate level\u2014\u2264{{convert|2500|to|3200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2265- -has a year-round temperature in the range of {{convert|10|to|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and an annual rainfall of {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The temperate level experiences rainstorms, hailstorms, and fog. Winter, or the rainy season, lasts from January through June, and the dry season or summer from July through December. Most rain falls in April. There also is a short rainy period in early October caused by moisture penetrating the Sierra from the Oriente. Quito and most other populated areas in the Sierra are located at this temperate level. The cold level extends from the temperate zone to {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Here, average temperatures are {{convert|3|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the precipitation often appears in the form of rain, hail, and thick fog. Above {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is the frozen level, where peaks are constantly capped with snow and ice, and temperatures range from below {{convert|0|to|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Precipitation frequently is in the form of snow, fog, and rain.\n\n=== The Oriente/Amazon Basin ===\n\nThe eastern lowlands in the Oriente experience abundant rainfall, especially in the Andean Piedmont, sometimes exceeding {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Temperatures average {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} in the western parts of this region. The jungle-covered plains of the Eastern lowlands register high levels of rainfall and temperatures surpassing {{convert|28|\u00b0C|1}}.\n\nBeing located on the equator, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands would have an equatorial climate were it not for the modifying effects of the [[Humboldt Current|Peruvian Current]]. Instead, climate on the islands follows a pattern more like that of the Sierra than the Costa. At sea level, the land is desertlike with temperatures of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}}. The eight summer months experience no precipitation, whereas the winter months of January through April have some fog and drizzle. Above sea level to an altitude of {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, the islands have a mixture of tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates. In general, temperatures are around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}}. There is constant fog and drizzle in the summer and rain in the winter. The cold level above {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}} has temperatures below {{convert|14|\u00b0C|1}}. It is cool along the tropical coast.\n\n== Elevation extremes ==\n\n* lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m\n* highest point: [[Chimborazo]] 6,267 m\n\n== Natural resources ==\nEcuador has land which is rich in petroleum.

Each Region is managed by a Regional Commissioner in conjunction with a Regional Board. Groups of Regions in close proximity comprise an ''Area'', which is managed by an Area Director in conjunction with an Area Board. Areas are grouped into 14 ''Sections'', each managed by a Section Director in conjunction with a Section Board. In addition, some Regions administered directly by the National Office, particularly [[#Programs outside the United States|those outside the United States]], are part of the so-called \"Section 99.\"\n\nThe governing body of AYSO is its National Board of Directors (NBOD), which operates similarly to other boards of directors. Additionally, AYSO also has a number of National Commissions, and their respective Chairpersons, provide the National President and National Board of Directors with advice and recommendations on coaching, refereeing, management, tournaments, marketing, eAYSO and development. The advice includes analysis of the impact of proposed or actual program changes including cost and financial impact at the national and local levels; on the specific discipline and community of practice; on other disciplines and national programs; on the standing and perception of AYSO as a national organization within the greater soccer and sports communities and on other potential or actual partners and like-minded organizations.<ref>{{cite web|title=AYSO National Commissions|url=http://www.ayso.org/aboutayso/AYSO_Leadership/commissions.htm|publisher=American Youth Soccer Organization|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427152436/http://www.ayso.org/aboutayso/AYSO_Leadership/commissions.htm|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==The AYSO Office ==\nThe AYSO Office is located at 19750 South Vermont Ave. in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], [[California]].\n\n===National Board of Director (NBOD) ===  \n\nMichael Karon : National President of AYSO.\n\nDan Howald: National Vice President , Marketing & Growth of AYSO.\n\nMaurice Miranda: National Vice President , Legal & Risk Management of AYSO.\n\nEileen Tabert: National Vice President , Administration & Management of AYSO.\n\nMargie Close: National Board Secretary of AYSO.\n\nDoug Ryan: National Board Treasurer of AYSO.\n\nDonna Nelson: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nYvette Barrett: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nJeff Ransom: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nRandy Pittman: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nCathy Farless : National Board Member of AYSO.\n\n===National Office Staff ===\n\nMatt Winegar : Transitional Executive Director of AYSO.\n\nAnnette Nastri : Director of Finance & Accounting \n\nYvonne Lara : Director of Marketing & Communications \n \nScott Snyder : Director of Programs & Education \n\nJill Meshekow : Director of Human Resources and Member Relations\n\n===Section Directors (SDs)===\n\nAYSO divides the country into 14 geographic Sections based on player population.

Each Region is managed by a Regional Commissioner in conjunction with a Regional Board. Groups of Regions in close proximity comprise an ''Area'', which is managed by an Area Director in conjunction with an Area Board. Areas are grouped into 14 ''Sections'', each managed by a Section Director in conjunction with a Section Board. In addition, some Regions administered directly by the National Office, particularly [[#Programs outside the United States|those outside the United States]], are part of the so-called \"Section 99.\"\n\nThe governing body of AYSO is its National Board of Directors (NBOD), which operates similarly to other boards of directors. Additionally, AYSO also has a number of National Commissions, and their respective Chairpersons, provide the National President and National Board of Directors with advice and recommendations on coaching, refereeing, management, tournaments, marketing, eAYSO and development. The advice includes analysis of the impact of proposed or actual program changes including cost and financial impact at the national and local levels; on the specific discipline and community of practice; on other disciplines and national programs; on the standing and perception of AYSO as a national organization within the greater soccer and sports communities and on other potential or actual partners and like-minded organizations.<ref>{{cite web|title=AYSO National Commissions|url=http://www.ayso.org/aboutayso/AYSO_Leadership/commissions.htm|publisher=American Youth Soccer Organization|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427152436/http://www.ayso.org/aboutayso/AYSO_Leadership/commissions.htm|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==The AYSO Office ==\nThe AYSO Office is located at 19750 South Vermont Ave. in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], [[California]].\n\n===National Board of Director (NBOD) ===  \n\nMichael Karon : National President of AYSO.\n\nDan Howald: National Vice President , Marketing & Growth of AYSO.\n\nMaurice Miranda: National Vice President , Legal & Risk Management of AYSO.\n\nEileen Tabert: National Vice President , Administration & Management of AYSO.\n\nMargie Close: National Board Secretary of AYSO.\n\nDoug Ryan: National Board Treasurer of AYSO.\n\nDonna Nelson: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nYvette Barrett: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nJeff Ransom: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nRandy Pittman: National Board Member of AYSO.\n\nCathy Farless : National Board Member of AYSO.\n\n===National Office Staff ===\n\nMatt Winegar : Transitional Executive Director of AYSO.\n\nAnnette Nastri : Director of Finance & Accounting \n\nYvonne Lara : Director of Marketing & Communications \n \nScott Snyder : Director of Programs & Education \n\nJill Meshekow : Director of Human Resources and Member Relations\n\n===Section Directors (SDs)===\n\nAYSO divides the country into 14 geographic Sections based on player population.

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within.

The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers. They were then allegedly tortured and executed, before their bodies were returned to the Indian side. General Gurbachan Jagat of India's Border Security Force claimed that the bodies showed signs of multilation, including strangulation, broken bones, as well as evidence of charring and scalding. <ref name=\"bbc1\" /><ref name=\"cnn1\" /><ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref name=\"assamtribune\" /><ref name=wsws /> The attack also left 3 Bangladeshi border guards dead and 5 injured.About 10,000 civilians fled the area after some 24 were wounded in the exchange of fire.<ref name=\"schendel\">van Schendel, Willem;

the third week of April 2001 between troops of the [[Bangladesh Rifles]] (BDR) and the Indian [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) on the <nowiki/>poorly marked [[international border]] between the two countries.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal in 1947]] left a poorly demarcated international border between India and Bangladesh (then-[[East Pakistan]]). Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]]. After its liberation, Bangladesh staked its claim to the area in which the Indian [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) had established a post in since 1971.<ref name=\"fline\" /><ref name=\"Analysis\" /> The village is one of the Indian [[exclaves]] on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]].<ref name=\"Hillary\">{{cite book |last=Kobayashi-Hillary |first=Mark |year=2004 |title=Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcEwts3f26wC&pg=PA61|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |pages=61\u2013 |isbn=978-3-540-20855-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book |title=The Europa World Year Book 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLvU9lroRuUC&pg=PA662 |year=2003 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |pages=662\u2013 |isbn=978-1-85743-227-5}}</ref> There are 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh claimed territory and 50 Bangladeshi ones in Indian claimed territory.

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers. They were then allegedly tortured and executed, before their bodies were returned to the Indian side. General Gurbachan Jagat of India's Border Security Force claimed that the bodies showed signs of multilation, including strangulation, broken bones, as well as evidence of charring and scalding. <ref name=\"bbc1\" /><ref name=\"cnn1\" /><ref name=\"guardian\" /><ref name=\"assamtribune\" /><ref name=wsws /> The attack also left 3 Bangladeshi border guards dead and 5 injured.About 10,000 civilians fled the area after some 24 were wounded in the exchange of fire.<ref name=\"schendel\">van Schendel, Willem;

People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed classes. Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra.\n\n==Early life==\nPhule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the [[Mali_caste|Mali]] caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners, vegetable vendors, and florists, and considered to be [[Shudra]].{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present-day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a ''chaugula'', a lowly village servant, in Katgun but moved to Khanwadi in [[Pune district]]. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved to [[Pune|Poona]] with his family, including three boys, in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist who taught them the secrets of the trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} Their fulfillment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings,  Jotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}}\n\nGovindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger.

He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm. However, a Christian convert from the same Mali caste as Phule recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule's father to allow Phule to attend the local Scottish Mission High School.<ref name=\"RobinsonKujur2010\">{{cite book|author1=Rowena Robinson|author2=Joseph Marianus Kujur|title=Margins of Faith: Dalit and Tribal Christianity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRtBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|date=17 August 2010|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|isbn=978-93-86042-93-4}}</ref>{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|The Scottish Mission school was operated by the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and educated pupils from a wide range of castes.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=105|ps=}}}} Phule completed his English schooling in 1847.

His work extended to many fields, including eradication of [[untouchability]] and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], and women's [[emancipation]]. He is mostly known for his efforts in educating women and lower caste people. He and his wife, [[Savitribai Phule]], were pioneers of women education in India.

People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed classes. Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra.\n\n==Early life==\nPhule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the [[Mali_caste|Mali]] caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners, vegetable vendors, and florists, and considered to be [[Shudra]].{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The original surname of the family had been ''Gorhe'' and had its origins in the village of [[Katgun]], in present-day [[Satara District]], Maharashtra. Phule's great-grandfather worked as a ''chaugula'', a lowly village servant, in Katgun but moved to Khanwadi in [[Pune district]]. He prospered there but his only son, Shetiba, who was of poor intelligence, subsequently squandered what had been gained. Shetiba moved to [[Pune|Poona]] with his family, including three boys, in search of some form of income. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist who taught them the secrets of the trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name of ''Phule'' (flower-man) in place of ''Gorhe''.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} Their fulfillment of commissions from the [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao II]], for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them {{convert|35|acre|ha}} of land on the basis of the ''[[Inamdar (feudal title)|inam]]'' system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=105\u2013106|ps=}} The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings,  Jotirao Phule's father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}}\n\nGovindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the younger. Chimnabai died before he was aged one.{{sfnp|Keer|1974|pp=1\u20133|ps=}} The Mali community did not make room for much by education, and after attending primary school to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, Jyotirao was withdrawn from school. He joined the menfolk of his family at work, both in the shop and the farm. However, a Christian convert from the same Mali caste as Phule recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule's father to allow Phule to attend the local Scottish Mission High School.<ref name=\"RobinsonKujur2010\">{{cite book|author1=Rowena Robinson|author2=Joseph Marianus Kujur|title=Margins of Faith: Dalit and Tribal Christianity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRtBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT54|date=17 August 2010|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|isbn=978-93-86042-93-4}}</ref>{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|The Scottish Mission school was operated by the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and educated pupils from a wide range of castes.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|p=105|ps=}}}} Phule completed his English schooling in 1847.

Phule participated in the customary marriage procession, but was later rebuked and insulted by his friend's parents for doing that. They told him that he being from a lower caste should have had the sense to keep away from that ceremony.

It was also in 1848 that he read [[Thomas Paine]]'s book ''[[Rights of Man]]'' and developed a keen sense of social justice. He realized that lower castes and women were at a disadvantage in Indian society, and also that education of these sections was vital to their emancipation.{{sfnp|O'Hanlon|2002|pp=110\u2013113|ps=}}To this end and in the same year, Phule first taught reading and writing to his wife, Savitribai, and then the couple started the first indigenously-run school for girls in Pune.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jotirao Phule and Low Caste Protest in Nineteenth-Century Western India |first=Rosalind |last=O'Hanlon |edition=Revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52308-0 |page=118}}</ref>{{efn|The American missionary [[Cynthia Farrar]] had started a girl's school in [[Bombay]] in In 1847, the Students' literary and scientific society started the Kamalabai high school for girls in the [[Girgaon]] neighborhood of [[Mumbai|Bombay]].
