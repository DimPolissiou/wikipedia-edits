Yearly demonstrations occur to commemorate historical important days; for example, each year on 20 July, a pro-TRNC organisation arranges a demonstration from [[Trafalgar Square]] to the Turkish Embassy in [[Belgrave Square]].  15 November is another date in which public places are used to voice political issues regarding the Cyprus dispute.<ref name=\"\u00d8stergaard-Nielsen 2003 loc=692\"/>\n\n===Politicians===\nBritish political figures of Turkish descent include [[Boris Johnson]], who has served as [[Mayor of London]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and whose great-grandfather was Turkish; [[Baroness]] [[Meral Ece|Meral Hussein-Ece]], the first woman of Turkish Cypriot origin to be a member of the [[House of Lords]];<ref>{{cite web |author=Liberal Democrat Voice|title=Baroness Meral Hussein-Ece's maiden speech\n| url = http://www.libdemvoice.org/baroness-meral-husseineces-maiden-speech-20346.html|accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> and [[Alp Mehmet]], a diplomat who retired in 2009 as British Ambassador to Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fipra.com/people/alp_mehmet~196/|title=Alp Mehmet|publisher=Fipra International|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Turkish Website Portal===\n* [https://www.britishturks.com/ BritishTurks.com]  - Life in the UK and a guide for living in London\n\n===Turkish television programmes===\n* [[Londra Aktuel]]\n* [[Euro Genc TV]]\n* [[TV Londra]]\n\n=== Turkish magazines ===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121015164517/http://www.adaaktuel.com/ AdaAkt\u00fcel Magazine]\n* [[BN Magazine]]\n* [http://www.t-vine.com/ T-VINE Magazine]\n\n=== Turkish newspapers ===\n* [[Avrupa Gazete]]\n* [[London Turkish Gazette]]\n* [[Olay Gazetesi]]\n\n=== Turkish radio ===\n* [[Bizim FM]]\n* [[London Turkish Radio]]\n* [[DEMRDYO]]\n\n=== Turkish film ===\n*[http://www.ltff.co.uk London Turkish Film Festival]\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also|List of British Turks}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of British Turks]]\n* [[Turks in London]]\n* [[Turkey \u2013 United Kingdom relations]]\n* [[Turks in Ireland]]\n* [[Turks in Europe]]\n* [[Britons in Turkey]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{citation |last=Abu-Haidar|first=Farida|year=1996|chapter=Turkish as a Marker of Ethnic Identity and Religious Affiliation|title=Language and identity in the Middle East and North Africa|editor-last=Suleiman|editor-first=Yasir|place=|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-0410-1}}.\n* {{citation |last=Aksan|first=Virginia H.|year=2007|title= Ottoman Wars 1700-1870: An Empire Besieged|place=|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-582-30807-0}}.\n* {{citation |last=Ansari|first=Humayun|year=2002|title=Muslims in Britain|url=http://www.mywf.org.uk/uploads/projects/borderlines/Archive/2007/muslimsinbritain.pdf|place=|publisher=Minority Rights Group International|isbn=1-897693-64-8}}.\n* {{citation |last=Ansari|first=Humayun|year=2004|title= The infidel within: Muslims in Britain since 1800|place=|publisher=C.

Both groups back up their lobbying by supporting British (and European) politicians.<ref name=\"\u00d8stergaard-Nielsen 2003 loc=688\"/> The general impression is that the majority of British Turkish Cypriots are mainly conservative supporters of a Turkish Cypriot state and lobby for its recognition.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|\u00d8stergaard-Nielsen|2003|loc=690}}</ref> British Turkish Cypriots cannot vote in Cypriot elections; therefore, Turkish Cypriot organisations have tended to take an active role in political affairs by providing economic support for political parties.<ref name=\"\u00d8stergaard-Nielsen 2003 loc=692\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|\u00d8stergaard-Nielsen|2003|loc=692}}</ref>\n\nThere are also campaigns which are directed at the wider British population and politicians.

In 1965 he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven [[home run]]s. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third [[1965 World Series|World Championship]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1968, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and {{frac|58|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings. The latter record was broken by fellow Dodger [[Orel Hershiser]] 20 years later. Hershiser, however,did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts.<ref>[[Orel Hershiser's scoreless innings streak]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}}\n\nDrysdale ended his career with 209 wins, 2,486 [[strikeout]]s, 167 [[complete game]]s and 49 [[Shutouts in baseball|shutouts]]. He was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1984, and had his number 53 retired at [[Dodger Stadium]] on July 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement, Drysdale was the last remaining player on the Dodgers who had played for [[Brooklyn]].\n\nHe won three [[MLB Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month awards]]: June 1959 (6-0 record, 1.71 [[earned run average]], 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6-0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5-1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June).\n\nIn 1965, [[Sandy Koufax]] declined to pitch the first game of the World Series because it was on [[Yom Kippur]], a [[Jewish]] holy day. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. When Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale said, \"I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.\" The Dodgers lost the game to the Minnesota Twins 8-2 but went on to win the Series [[1965 World Series|4 games to 3]].\n\nDrysdale and Koufax took part in a famous salary holdout together in the spring of 1966, with both finally signing contracts just before the season opened. Those contracts made them the first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year.<ref name=NYT1/>\n\n== Broadcasting career ==\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = LAret53.PNG\n|Name   = Donald Drysdale\n|Number = 53\n|Team   = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year   = 1984\n|}}\nA chronically sore shoulder forced Drysdale to retire during the [[1969 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1969]] season. The next year, he started a broadcasting career that continued for the rest of his life: first for the [[Montreal Expos]] ([[1970 Montreal Expos season|1970]]\u2013[[1971 Montreal Expos season|1971]]), then the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ([[1972 Texas Rangers season|1972]]), [[California Angels]] ([[1973 California Angels season|1973]]\u2013[[1979 California Angels season|1979]], [[1981 California Angels season|1981]]), [[Chicago White Sox]] ([[1982 Chicago White Sox season|1982]]\u2013[[1987 Chicago White Sox season|1987]]), [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] (1977), [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] (1978<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classicsportsmedia.blogspot.com/2013/02/history-of-1-analyst-demotions.html |title=History of #1 analyst demotions |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 18, 2013 |work=Classic Sports TV and Media |publisher= |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref>\u20131986), and finally back in Los Angeles with the Dodgers (from [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1988]] until his death in [[1993 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1993]]). He also worked with his Angels' partner [[Dick Enberg]] on [[Los Angeles Rams]] football broadcasts from [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|1973]]\u2013[[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|1976]].\n\nWhile at [[ABC Sports]], Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional [[College Football on ABC|college football]] games as well as ''[[Superstars]]'' and ''[[Wide World of Sports (US television show)|Wide World of Sports]]''. In [[1979 World Series|1979]], Drysdale covered the [[World Series Trophy]] presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, [[Keith Jackson]] called an [[1980 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]&ndash;[[1980 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] [[college football]] game for [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] in the afternoon, then flew to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] to call Game 4 of the [[1980 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] between the [[1980 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] and [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]]. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on [[play-by-play]] for the early innings.\n\nIn 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) for the [[1984 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] between the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] and [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].

Drysdale on the call:\n\n:{{cquote|Deep right field, way back. [[Henry Cotto|Cotto]] going back to the wall...it's gone! Home run [[Steve Garvey|Garvey]]!

LaRussa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to the approval of the [[Comiskey Park]] crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale remarked, ''\"Go get 'em, [[ethnic slur#D|Dago]]!\"''\n\nFor the [[1985 Chicago White Sox season|Sox]], Drysdale broadcast [[Tom Seaver]]'s 300th victory, against the host [[1985 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station [[WPIX]].\n\n===1987===\nDrysdale hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called ''Radio Baseball Cards''. 162 episodes were produced with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to the memory and impact of [[Jackie Robinson]] as told by teammates, opponents and admirers. ''Radio Baseball Cards'' aired on 38 stations, including [[WNBC]] New York, [[KSFO]] San Francisco and [[WEZE|WEEI]] Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector's edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smarterpodcasts.com|title=Smarter Podcasts - Delivering Sound Advice - Podcast Production|website=Smarter Podcasts}}</ref>\n\n===1988===\nDrysdale conducted all of the National League player interviews for the [[Baseball Talk]] series in 1988 ([[Joe Torre]] did the same for the American League).\n\nOn September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger [[Orel Hershiser]] surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark \u2013 meaning not only that he would have to prevent the [[1988 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]' anemic offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2\u20131 in 16 innings. Hershiser almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale came onto the field to hug him, and said, \"Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nDrysdale also called [[Kirk Gibson]]'s [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run|walk-off home run]] in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=Don Drysdale's call of Gibson home run|id=FpsqaSJkovw}}</ref> for the [[Dodgers Radio Network]]:\n\n:{{cquote|Gibson a deep sigh, re-gripping the bat, shoulders just shrugged, now goes to the top of the helmet as he always does, steps in with that left foot.

Drysdale's final broadcast was the night before his death.\n\nDrysdale's broadcasting colleague [[Vin Scully]], who was instructed not to say anything on the air until Drysdale's family was notified, announced the news of his death by saying, \"Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one.

In 1965 he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven [[home run]]s. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third [[1965 World Series|World Championship]] in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1968, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and {{frac|58|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings. The latter record was broken by fellow Dodger [[Orel Hershiser]] 20 years later.

He was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1984, and had his number 53 retired at [[Dodger Stadium]] on July 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement, Drysdale was the last remaining player on the Dodgers who had played for [[Brooklyn]].\n\nHe won three [[MLB Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month awards]]: June 1959 (6-0 record, 1.71 [[earned run average]], 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6-0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5-1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June).\n\nIn 1965, [[Sandy Koufax]] declined to pitch the first game of the World Series because it was on [[Yom Kippur]], a [[Jewish]] holy day. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. When Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale said, \"I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.\" The Dodgers lost the game to the Minnesota Twins 8-2 but went on to win the Series [[1965 World Series|4 games to 3]].\n\nDrysdale and Koufax took part in a famous salary holdout together in the spring of 1966, with both finally signing contracts just before the season opened.

He also worked with his Angels' partner [[Dick Enberg]] on [[Los Angeles Rams]] football broadcasts from [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|1973]]\u2013[[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|1976]].\n\nWhile at [[ABC Sports]], Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional [[College Football on ABC|college football]] games as well as ''[[Superstars]]'' and ''[[Wide World of Sports (US television show)|Wide World of Sports]]''. In [[1979 World Series|1979]], Drysdale covered the [[World Series Trophy]] presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, [[Keith Jackson]] called an [[1980 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]&ndash;[[1980 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] [[college football]] game for [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] in the afternoon, then flew to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] to call Game 4 of the [[1980 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] between the [[1980 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] and [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]]. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on [[play-by-play]] for the early innings.\n\nIn 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) for the [[1984 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] between the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] and [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].

LaRussa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to the approval of the [[Comiskey Park]] crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale remarked, ''\"Go get 'em, [[ethnic slur#D|Dago]]!\"''\n\nFor the [[1985 Chicago White Sox season|Sox]], Drysdale broadcast [[Tom Seaver]]'s 300th victory, against the host [[1985 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station [[WPIX]].\n\n===1987===\nDrysdale hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called ''Radio Baseball Cards''. 162 episodes were produced with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to the memory and impact of [[Jackie Robinson]] as told by teammates, opponents and admirers. ''Radio Baseball Cards'' aired on 38 stations, including [[WNBC]] New York, [[KSFO]] San Francisco and [[WEZE|WEEI]] Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector's edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smarterpodcasts.com|title=Smarter Podcasts - Delivering Sound Advice - Podcast Production|website=Smarter Podcasts}}</ref>\n\n===1988===\nDrysdale conducted all of the National League player interviews for the [[Baseball Talk]] series in 1988 ([[Joe Torre]] did the same for the American League).\n\nOn September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger [[Orel Hershiser]] surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark \u2013 meaning not only that he would have to prevent the [[1988 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]' anemic offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2\u20131 in 16 innings. Hershiser almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale came onto the field to hug him, and said, \"Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nDrysdale also called [[Kirk Gibson]]'s [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run|walk-off home run]] in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=Don Drysdale's call of Gibson home run|id=FpsqaSJkovw}}</ref> for the [[Dodgers Radio Network]]:\n\n:{{cquote|Gibson a deep sigh, re-gripping the bat, shoulders just shrugged, now goes to the top of the helmet as he always does, steps in with that left foot.

The sign reads ''One people, one destiny''.]]\n{{History of Australia}}\nThe '''Federation of Australia''' was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[Colony of Queensland|Queensland]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of Tasmania|Tasmania]], [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia (1836)|South Australia]], and [[History of Western Australia#Colonial era|Western Australia]] agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of [[federalism in Australia]]. [[Fiji]] and [[New Zealand]] were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article908489|title=Fiji and Australian Federation. \u2013 (From the Herald's own Correspondent.) Melbourne, Monday|work=The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser|date=25 October 1883|access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref> Following federation, the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government (and the bicameral legislatures) that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nThe efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir [[Henry Parkes]], Premier of [[New South Wales]], was instrumental in this process. Sir [[Edmund Barton]], second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause, was the caretaker [[Prime Minister of Australia]] at the inaugural [[1901 Australian federal election|national election in 1901]] in March 1901. The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.\n\nThis period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time, known as [[Federation architecture]], or Federation style.\n\n==Federal idea ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 202947 Crowds of people outside the Treasury Building, Queen Street, Brisbane, Queensland, 1901.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Governor of Queensland]] [[Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington|Lord Lamington]] reading the Queen's proclamation on Federation in [[Brisbane]]]]\n\n===Federal Council ===\nA serious movement for Federation of the colonies arose in the late 1880s, a time when there was increasing nationalism amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native-born. The idea of being \"Australian\" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a [[telegraph]] system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations that had emerged around the world, such as the United States and Canada.\n\nSir [[Henry Parkes]], then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867. After it was rejected by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], Parkes brought up the issue again in 1880, this time as the [[Premier of New South Wales]]. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform [[tariff]] rates. The Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade, and [[interstate commerce]] would be unaffected by [[protectionism]] and measurement and transport would be standardised.\n\nThe final (and successful) push for a Federal Council came at an Intercolonial Convention in Sydney in November and December 1883. The trigger was the British rejection of Queensland's unilateral annexation of [[New Guinea]] and the British Government wish to see a federalised Australasia. The convention was called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the [[German Empire|German]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] in New Guinea and in [[New Hebrides]]. Sir [[Samuel Griffith]], the [[Premier of Queensland]], drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] to enact the bill as the ''[[Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885]]''.<ref>note 2, at 18\u201321.</ref>\n\nAs a result, a [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the [[Australasia|South Pacific]] islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the [[crown colony|Crown Colonies]] of Western Australia and [[Fiji]], became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to [[extradition]], regulation of fisheries, and so on, but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value. \n[[File:1886 Anti-Chinese Cartoon from Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|Published in 1888 this cartoon depicts the [[anti-Chinese]] sentiment that was one of the driving forces behind the push for federation.]]\n\nNevertheless, it was the first major form of inter-colonial co-operation. It provided an opportunity for [[Federalist]]s from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia's constitutional structure. In terms of the ''Federal Council of Australia Act'', the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their \"common interest\" which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]].\n\n=== Early opposition ===\nThe individual colonies, Victoria excepted, were somewhat wary of Federation. Politicians from the smaller colonies, in particular, disliked the very idea of delegating power to a national government; they feared that any such government would inevitably be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, for its part, worried that the advent of [[White Australia Policy|race-based]] national legislation would restrict the importing of [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanaka]] labourers, thereby jeopardising its [[sugar cane]] industry.\n\nThese were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation. Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of [[tariff]]s, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier [[James Service]] described [[fiscal union]] as \"the lion in the way\" of the federation.\n\nA further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies, there was the possibility (which never became an actuality) that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nEven without the concerns, there was a debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the United States had experienced the traumatic [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nThe nascent [[Australian labour movement]] was less than wholly committed in its support for federation. On the one hand, nationalist sentiment was strong within the labour movement and there was much support for the idea of [[White Australia]]. On the other hand, labour representatives feared that federation would distract attention from the need for [[reform movement|social]] and [[Labor relations|industrial]] reform, and further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The federal conventions included no representatives of organised labour. In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative. These representatives wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices. They also regarded the proposed senate as much too powerful, with the capacity to block attempts at social and political reform, much as the colonial upper houses were quite openly doing at that time.\n\nReligious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible. As a general rule, pro-federation leaders were Protestants, while Catholics' enthusiasm for federation was much weaker, not least because Parkes had been militantly anti-Catholic for decades (and because the labour movement was disproportionately Catholic in its membership).\n\n== Early constitutional conventions ==\nIn the early 1890s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|National Australasian Convention]], meeting in Sydney in 1891. New Zealand was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although its delegates indicated that it would be unlikely to join the Federation at its foundation, but it would probably be interested in doing so at a later date.\n\n===Conference of 1890 ===\nThe Conference of 1890 was organised at the instigation of Parkes. The account of the calling of the 1890 conference usually begins with [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], goading the ageing Parkes at a luncheon on 15 June 1889. Parkes reportedly boasted that he \"could confederate these colonies in twelve months\". Carrington retorted, \"Then why don't you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life.\"<ref>Martin, ''Henry Parkes'', at 383.</ref> Parkes the next day wrote to the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[Duncan Gillies]], offering to advance the cause of Federation. Gillies's response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring [[New South Wales]] into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir [[Thomas McIlwraith]]. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border, and delivered the historic [[Tenterfield Oration]] on 24 October 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.\n\nThrough the latter part of 1889, the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Parkes (Premier) and [[William McMillan (Australian politician)|William McMillan]] (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and [[Alfred Deakin]] (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] (Leader of the Opposition) and [[John Murtagh Macrossan]] (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr. [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] (Premier) and [[Thomas Playford II|Thomas Playford]] (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] (Attorney-General) and [[Stafford Bird]] (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir [[James George Lee Steere]] (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain [[William Russell (New Zealand politician)|William Russell]] (Colonial Secretary) and Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]].\n[[File:Federal Oak 1890.jpg|thumb|The Federal [[Oak tree|Oak]] in the gardens of the Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne. The tree was planted in 1890 by Sir Henry Parkes to commemorate the meeting of the Australian Federal Conference.]]\nWhen the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on 6 February, the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer maximum temperature of {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C}} in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.\n\nWhile some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was little support for federation in their respective colonies.\n\nA basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition of government. The [[British North America Act, 1867]], which had confederated the [[provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], provided a model with respect to the relations between the federation and the Crown. There was less enthusiasm, however, for the [[centralization|centralism]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]], especially from the smaller states. Following the conference of 1890, the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.<ref>Williams J, \"'With Eyes Open': Andrew Inglis Clark and our Republican Tradition\" (1995) 23(2) ''Federal Law Review'' 149 at 165.</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provided another example, it was inevitable that the delegates should look to the [[Constitution of the United States]] as the other major model of a federation within the English-speaking world. It gave just a few powers to the federal government and left the majority of matters within the legislative competence of the states. It also provided that the Senate should consist of an equal number of members from each State while the Lower House should reflect the national distribution of population. [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the [[US Constitution]] as an example of the protection of States' rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was \"an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation.\"<ref>''Debates of the Australian Federation Conference'', at 25.</ref> The introduction by Deakin of [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]]'s ''The American Commonwealth'' also had far-reaching influence.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Making of the Australian Constitution | last=La Nauze | first=J. A. | isbn=0-522-84016-7 | page=273}}</ref>\n\nThe conference in Melbourne ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.\n\n=== Clark's draft constitution ===\n[[Image:Andrew Inglis Clark.jpg|thumb|right|Andrew Clark, circa 1907]]\n\nA. I. Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia.<ref>As early as 1874, he published a comparative study of the American, Canadian and Swiss constitutions.</ref> In May 1890, he travelled to London to conduct an appeal on behalf of the [[Government of Tasmania]] before the [[Privy Council]]. During this trip, he began writing a draft constitution, taking the main provisions of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] and its supplements up through 1890, the US Constitution, the [[Federal Council of Australasia Act]], and various Australian colonial constitutions. Clark returned from London by way of [[Boston]], Massachusetts, where he held discussions about his draft with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], and [[Moncure Conway]] among others.<ref>Clark, Conway and Holmes were all [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Clark had met Conway when he travelled to [[Hobart, Tasmania]], as part of his speaking tour in 1883. Conway later introduced Clark to Holmes.</ref>\n\nClark's draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:\n\n* The Australian Federation is described as the Commonwealth of Australia\n* There are three separate and equal branches \u2013 the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judicature.\n* The Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate\n* It specified the [[Separation of powers in Australia|separation of powers]] and the [[Federalism in Australia|division of powers]] between the Federal and State governments.\n\nUpon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of [[W. O. Wise]], the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed.<ref>Letter from W. O. Wise to A. P. Canaway dated 29 June 1921. Cover page to First draft of Australian Constitution. Mitchell Library MS, Q342.901</ref> In February 1891, Inglis Clark circulated copies of his draft to Parkes, Barton and probably Playford as well.<ref name=\"neasey\">{{cite book | title=Andrew Inglis Clark | year=2001 | publisher=University of Tasmania Law Press | last=Neasey | first=F. M. | author2=Neasey, L. J. | isbn=0-85901-964-0}}</ref> This draft was always intended to be a private working document, and was never published.<ref>La Nauze, page 24</ref>\n\n=== Convention of 1891 ===\nThe [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] proposed at the Convention of 1891 was to adopt the nomenclature of the [[United States Congress]]. This proposal provided the broad outline of a Federal government. Its lower house was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of their population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each \"province\". This American model was mixed with the [[Westminster system]] by which the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and other ministers would be appointed by the representative of the [[British Crown]] from among the members of the political party holding a majority in the lower House.\n\nGriffith identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the Federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred on the contention of [[Alfred Deakin]], that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the Federal structure.\n\nOver the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark's draft aboard the Queensland Government's steam yacht ''[[Lucinda (steam yacht)|Lucinda]]''. (Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney). Griffith's draft Constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but it lapsed in [[New South Wales]], after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.\n\n=== Griffith or Clark? ===\nThe importance of the draft Constitution of 1891 was recognised by [[John La Nauze]] when he flatly declared that \"The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather.\"<ref>La Nauze, note 11 at 78.</ref> In the Twenty-First Century, however, a lively debate has sprung up as to whether the principal credit for this draft belongs to Queensland's Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] or Tasmania's [[Andrew Inglis Clark]]. The debate began with the publication of Peter Botsman's ''The Great Constitutional Swindle: A Citizen's Guide to the Australian Constitution''<ref name=\"swindle\">{{cite book|title=The Great Constitutional Swindle|last=Botsman|first=Peter|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|year=2000|isbn=1-86403-062-3|page=19}}</ref> in 2000, and a biography of ''Andrew Inglis Clark'' by F.M. Neasey and L.J. Neasey published by the University of Tasmania Law Press in 2001.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andrew Inglis Clark|last=Neasey|first=F.M.|last2=Neasey|first2=L.J.|publisher=University of Tasmania Law Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Hobart|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional view attached almost sole responsibility for the 1891 draft to Griffith. Quick and Garran, for instance, state curtly that Griffith \"had the chief hand in the actual drafting of the Bill.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated constitution of the Australian Commonwealth|last=Quick|first=John|last2=Garran|first2=Robert Randolph|publisher=Angus and Robertson|year=1901|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=130|quote=|via=}}</ref> Given that the authors of this highly respected work were themselves active members of the federal movement, it may be presumed that this view represents - if not the complete truth - then, at least, the consensus opinion amongst Australia's \"founding fathers\".\n\nIn his 1969 entry on \"Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848\u20131907)\" for the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Henry|date=1969|year=|title=Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848 -1907)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clark-andrew-inglis-3211|journal=Australian Dictionary of Biography|volume=|pages=|access-date=31 January 2017|via=}}</ref> Henry Reynolds offers a more nuanced view:<blockquote>Before the National Australasian Convention in Sydney in 1891 he [Clark] circulated his own draft constitution bill. This was practically a transcript of relevant provisions from the British North American Act, the United States Constitution and the Federal Council Act, arranged systematically, but it was to be of great use to the drafting committee at the convention. Parkes received it with reservations, suggesting that 'the structure should be evolved bit by bit'. George Higinbotham admitted the 'acknowledged defects & disadvantages' of responsible government, but criticized Clark's plan to separate the executive and the legislature. Clark's draft also differed from the adopted constitution in his proposal for 'a separate federal judiciary', with the new Supreme Court replacing the Privy Council as the highest court of appeal on all questions of law, which would be 'a wholesome innovation upon the American system'. He became a member of the Constitutional Committee and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Although he took little part in the debates he assisted (Sir) Samuel Griffith, (Sir) Edmund Barton and Charles Cameron Kingston in revising Griffith's original draft of the adopted constitution on the Queensland government's steam yacht, ''Lucinda''; though he was too ill to be present when the main work was done, his own draft had been the basis for most of Griffith's text. </blockquote>Clark's supporters are quick to point out that 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark's draft,<ref name=\"swindle\" /> and that \"only eight of Inglis Clark\u2019s ninety-six clauses failed to find their way into the final Australian Constitution\";<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neasey|first=Frank|year=1991|title=Andrew Inglis Clark and Australian Federation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=C39CAE7B9E4743FA814AD5759747601D&_z=z|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=13|pages=|via=}}</ref> but these are potentially misleading statistics. As Professor John Williams has pointed out:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=John (Professor)|year=2014|title=Andrew Inglis Clark: Our Constitution and His Influence|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=50F3804219D141609BD6887ECDB41E74&_z=z#_ftn28|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=61|pages=|via=}}</ref><blockquote>It is easy to point to the document and dismiss it as a mere \u2018cut and paste\u2019 from known provisions. While there is some validity in such observations it does tend to overlook the fact that there are very few variations to be added once the basic structure is agreed. So for instance, there was always going to be parts dealing with the executive, the parliament and the judiciary in any Australian constitution. The fact that Inglis Clark modelled his on the American Constitution is no surprise once that basic decision was made. Issues of the respective legislative powers, the role of the states, the power of amendment and financial questions were the detail of the debate that the framers were about to address in 1891.</blockquote>As to who was responsible for the actual detailed drafting, as distinct from the broad structure and framework of the 1891 draft, Professor Williams (for one) is in no doubt:<ref name=\":0\" /><blockquote>In terms of style there can be little argument that Inglis Clark\u2019s Constitution is not as crisp or clean as Kingston\u2019s 1891 draft Constitution. This is not so much a reflection on Inglis Clark, but an acknowledgement of the talents of Charles Kingston and Sir Samuel Griffith as drafters. They were direct and economical with words. The same cannot always be said of Inglis Clark.</blockquote>\n\n== Later constitutional conventions ==\nThe revival of the federal movement stemmed from the growth of federal leagues and nationalist organisations that were committed to federation, such as the [[Australian Natives' Association]]. There were two so-called People's Conventions held in [[Corowa]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].\n[[File:Australia Federation Ribbon2.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|A ribbon produced in Sydney]]\nIn 1893 [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]], who had attended the Corowa convention, drew up a bill which became the basis of discussion at the Adelaide Convention (see below) and is considered to have contributed largely to the eventual constitution. Quick with [[Robert Garran]] went on to publish ''The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth'' in 1901, which is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative works on the Australian Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|title=Closer Look: The Australian Constitution|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|access-date=9 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405180301/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|archive-date=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895 a proposal was accepted by the premiers of the Australian colonies to establish a new Convention by popular vote, with the resulting draft of the constitution being submitted to the electors of each colony in a [[referendum]]. The Convention held meetings over the course of a year, beginning first in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, later meeting in Sydney, and culminating in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of [[responsible government]]. There was also a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen by popular vote with the voters in each State acting as one electorate.\n\nA draft bill was drawn up in 1898, and then sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate. Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four of them, however, the enabling legislation in New South Wales required the support of at least 80,000 voters for passage, and this number was not reached.<ref name=ccwa>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/Documents/federation.pdf|title=Celebrating Federation|publisher=Constitutional Centre of Western Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> A meeting of the colonial premiers in early 1899 agreed to a number of amendments to make the constitution more acceptable to New South Wales.  Known as the \"[[Edward Braddon|Braddon Clause]]\", the amendments provided for the return of customs revenue to the states for ten years.  It was also agreed that the new federal capital was to be built in New South Wales provided it was at least a hundred miles (160&nbsp;km) from Sydney.<ref name=ccwa /> In June 1899, the referendum was held again in all the colonies except for [[Western Australia]], where the vote was not held until the following year.

Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.\n\nThe new constitution established a [[bicameral]] Parliament, containing a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The office of [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government. The Constitution also established a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.\n\nThe site of a federal capital was disputed heavily between the two arch-rivals Sydney and [[Melbourne]]; the compromise was that a separate territory (the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) would be established within New South Wales to hold a new capital, while Parliament would sit in Melbourne until the new city was constructed. The site eventually chosen for the city became [[Canberra]].\n\n==Landmarks named after Federation==\n{{see also|Federation architecture}}\nThe significance of Federation for Australia is such that a number of landmarks, natural and man-made, have been named after it.

[[Fiji]] and [[New Zealand]] were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article908489|title=Fiji and Australian Federation. \u2013 (From the Herald's own Correspondent.) Melbourne, Monday|work=The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser|date=25 October 1883|access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref> Following federation, the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government (and the bicameral legislatures) that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nThe efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir [[Henry Parkes]], Premier of [[New South Wales]], was instrumental in this process. Sir [[Edmund Barton]], second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause, was the caretaker [[Prime Minister of Australia]] at the inaugural [[1901 Australian federal election|national election in 1901]] in March 1901. The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.\n\nThis period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time, known as [[Federation architecture]], or Federation style.\n\n==Federal idea ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 202947 Crowds of people outside the Treasury Building, Queen Street, Brisbane, Queensland, 1901.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Governor of Queensland]] [[Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington|Lord Lamington]] reading the Queen's proclamation on Federation in [[Brisbane]]]]\n\n===Federal Council ===\nA serious movement for Federation of the colonies arose in the late 1880s, a time when there was increasing nationalism amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native-born. The idea of being \"Australian\" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a [[telegraph]] system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations that had emerged around the world, such as the United States and Canada.\n\nSir [[Henry Parkes]], then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867. After it was rejected by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], Parkes brought up the issue again in 1880, this time as the [[Premier of New South Wales]]. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform [[tariff]] rates. The Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade, and [[interstate commerce]] would be unaffected by [[protectionism]] and measurement and transport would be standardised.\n\nThe final (and successful) push for a Federal Council came at an Intercolonial Convention in Sydney in November and December 1883. The trigger was the British rejection of Queensland's unilateral annexation of [[New Guinea]] and the British Government wish to see a federalised Australasia. The convention was called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the [[German Empire|German]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] in New Guinea and in [[New Hebrides]]. Sir [[Samuel Griffith]], the [[Premier of Queensland]], drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] to enact the bill as the ''[[Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885]]''.<ref>note 2, at 18\u201321.</ref>\n\nAs a result, a [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the [[Australasia|South Pacific]] islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the [[crown colony|Crown Colonies]] of Western Australia and [[Fiji]], became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to [[extradition]], regulation of fisheries, and so on, but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value. \n[[File:1886 Anti-Chinese Cartoon from Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|Published in 1888 this cartoon depicts the [[anti-Chinese]] sentiment that was one of the driving forces behind the push for federation.]]\n\nNevertheless, it was the first major form of inter-colonial co-operation. It provided an opportunity for [[Federalist]]s from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia's constitutional structure. In terms of the ''Federal Council of Australia Act'', the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their \"common interest\" which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]].\n\n=== Early opposition ===\nThe individual colonies, Victoria excepted, were somewhat wary of Federation. Politicians from the smaller colonies, in particular, disliked the very idea of delegating power to a national government; they feared that any such government would inevitably be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, for its part, worried that the advent of [[White Australia Policy|race-based]] national legislation  would restrict the importing of [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanaka]] labourers, thereby jeopardising its [[sugar cane]] industry.\n\nThese were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation. Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of [[tariff]]s, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier [[James Service]] described [[fiscal union]] as \"the lion in the way\" of federation.\n\nA further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies there was the possibility (which never became an actuality) that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nEven without the concerns, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the United States had experienced the traumatic [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nThe nascent [[Australian labour movement]] was less than wholly committed in its support for federation. On the one hand, nationalist sentiment was strong within the labour movement and there was much support for the idea of [[White Australia]]. On the other hand, labour representatives feared that federation would distract attention from the need for [[reform movement|social]] and [[Labor relations|industrial]] reform, and further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The federal conventions included no representatives of organised labour. In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative. These representatives wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices. They also regarded the proposed senate as much too powerful, with the capacity to block attempts at social and political reform, much as the colonial upper houses were quite openly doing at that time.\n\nReligious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible. As a general rule, pro-federation leaders were Protestants, while Catholics' enthusiasm for federation was much weaker, not least because Parkes had been militantly anti-Catholic for decades (and because the labour movement was disproportionately Catholic in its membership).\n\n== Early constitutional conventions ==\nIn the early 1890s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|National Australasian Convention]], meeting in Sydney in 1891. New Zealand was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although its delegates indicated that it would be unlikely to join the Federation at its foundation, but it would probably be interested in doing so at a later date.\n\n===Conference of 1890 ===\nThe Conference of 1890 was organised at the instigation of Parkes. The account of the calling of the 1890 conference usually begins with [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], goading the ageing Parkes at a luncheon on 15 June 1889. Parkes reportedly boasted that he \"could confederate these colonies in twelve months\". Carrington retorted, \"Then why don't you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life.\"<ref>Martin, ''Henry Parkes'', at 383.</ref> Parkes the next day wrote to the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[Duncan Gillies]], offering to advance the cause of Federation. Gillies's response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring [[New South Wales]] into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir [[Thomas McIlwraith]]. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border, and delivered the historic [[Tenterfield Oration]] on 24 October 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.\n\nThrough the latter part of 1889, the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Parkes (Premier) and [[William McMillan (Australian politician)|William McMillan]] (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and [[Alfred Deakin]] (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] (Leader of the Opposition) and [[John Murtagh Macrossan]] (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr. [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] (Premier) and [[Thomas Playford II|Thomas Playford]] (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] (Attorney-General) and [[Stafford Bird]] (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir [[James George Lee Steere]] (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain [[William Russell (New Zealand politician)|William Russell]] (Colonial Secretary) and Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]].\n[[File:Federal Oak 1890.jpg|thumb|The Federal [[Oak tree|Oak]] in the gardens of the Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne. The tree was planted in 1890 by Sir Henry Parkes to commemorate the meeting of the Australian Federal Conference.]]\nWhen the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on 6 February, the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer maximum temperature of {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C}} in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.\n\nWhile some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was little support for federation in their respective colonies.\n\nA basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition of government. The [[British North America Act, 1867]], which had confederated the [[provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], provided a model with respect to the relations between the federation and the Crown. There was less enthusiasm, however, for the [[centralization|centralism]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]], especially from the smaller states. Following the conference of 1890, the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.<ref>Williams J, \"'With Eyes Open': Andrew Inglis Clark and our Republican Tradition\" (1995) 23(2) ''Federal Law Review'' 149 at 165.</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provided another example, it was inevitable that the delegates should look to the [[Constitution of the United States]] as the other major model of a federation within the English-speaking world. It gave just a few powers to the federal government and left the majority of matters within the legislative competence of the states. It also provided that the Senate should consist of an equal number of members from each State while the Lower House should reflect the national distribution of population. [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the [[US Constitution]] as an example of the protection of States' rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was \"an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation.\"<ref>''Debates of the Australian Federation Conference'', at 25.</ref> The introduction by Deakin of [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]]'s ''The American Commonwealth'' also had far-reaching influence.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Making of the Australian Constitution | last=La Nauze | first=J. A. | isbn=0-522-84016-7 | page=273}}</ref>\n\nThe conference in Melbourne ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.\n\n=== Clark's draft constitution ===\n[[Image:Andrew Inglis Clark.jpg|thumb|right|Andrew Clark, circa 1907]]\n\nA. I. Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia.<ref>As early as 1874, he published a comparative study of the American, Canadian and Swiss constitutions.</ref> In May 1890, he travelled to London to conduct an appeal on behalf of the [[Government of Tasmania]] before the [[Privy Council]]. During this trip, he began writing a draft constitution, taking the main provisions of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] and its supplements up through 1890, the US Constitution, the [[Federal Council of Australasia Act]], and various Australian colonial constitutions. Clark returned from London by way of [[Boston]], Massachusetts, where he held discussions about his draft with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], and [[Moncure Conway]] among others.<ref>Clark, Conway and Holmes were all [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Clark had met Conway when he travelled to [[Hobart, Tasmania]], as part of his speaking tour in 1883. Conway later introduced Clark to Holmes.</ref>\n\nClark's draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:\n\n* The Australian Federation is described as the Commonwealth of Australia\n* There are three separate and equal branches \u2013 the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judicature.\n* The Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate\n* It specified the [[Separation of powers in Australia|separation of powers]] and the [[Federalism in Australia|division of powers]] between the Federal and State governments.\n\nUpon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of [[W. O. Wise]], the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed.<ref>Letter from W. O. Wise to A. P.

This proposal provided the broad outline of a Federal government. Its lower house was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of their population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each \"province\". This American model was mixed with the [[Westminster system]] by which the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and other ministers would be appointed by the representative of the [[British Crown]] from among the members of the political party holding a majority in the lower House.\n\nGriffith identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the Federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred on the contention of [[Alfred Deakin]], that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the Federal structure.\n\nOver the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark's draft aboard the Queensland Government's steam yacht ''[[Lucinda (steam yacht)|Lucinda]]''. (Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney). Griffith's draft Constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but it lapsed in [[New South Wales]], after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.\n\n=== Griffith or Clark? ===\nThe importance of the draft Constitution of 1891 was recognised by [[John La Nauze]] when he flatly declared that \"The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather.\"<ref>La Nauze, note 11 at 78.</ref> In the Twenty-First Century, however, a lively debate has sprung up as to whether the principal credit for this draft belongs to Queensland's Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] or Tasmania's [[Andrew Inglis Clark]]. The debate began with the publication of Peter Botsman's ''The Great Constitutional Swindle: A Citizen's Guide to the Australian Constitution''<ref name=\"swindle\">{{cite book|title=The Great Constitutional Swindle|last=Botsman|first=Peter|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|year=2000|isbn=1-86403-062-3|page=19}}</ref> in 2000, and a biography of ''Andrew Inglis Clark'' by F.M. Neasey and L.J. Neasey published by the University of Tasmania Law Press in 2001.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andrew Inglis Clark|last=Neasey|first=F.M.|last2=Neasey|first2=L.J.|publisher=University of Tasmania Law Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Hobart|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional view attached almost sole responsibility for the 1891 draft to Griffith. Quick and Garran, for instance, state curtly that Griffith \"had the chief hand in the actual drafting of the Bill.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated constitution of the Australian Commonwealth|last=Quick|first=John|last2=Garran|first2=Robert Randolph|publisher=Angus and Robertson|year=1901|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=130|quote=|via=}}</ref> Given that the authors of this highly respected work were themselves active members of the federal movement, it may be presumed that this view represents - if not the complete truth - then, at least, the consensus opinion amongst Australia's \"founding fathers\".\n\nIn his 1969 entry on \"Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848\u20131907)\" for the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Henry|date=1969|year=|title=Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848 -1907)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clark-andrew-inglis-3211|journal=Australian Dictionary of Biography|volume=|pages=|access-date=31 January 2017|via=}}</ref> Henry Reynolds offers a more nuanced view:<blockquote>Before the National Australasian Convention in Sydney in 1891 he [Clark] circulated his own draft constitution bill. This was practically a transcript of relevant provisions from the British North American Act, the United States Constitution and the Federal Council Act, arranged systematically, but it was to be of great use to the drafting committee at the convention. Parkes received it with reservations, suggesting that 'the structure should be evolved bit by bit'. George Higinbotham admitted the 'acknowledged defects & disadvantages' of responsible government, but criticized Clark's plan to separate the executive and the legislature. Clark's draft also differed from the adopted constitution in his proposal for 'a separate federal judiciary', with the new Supreme Court replacing the Privy Council as the highest court of appeal on all questions of law, which would be 'a wholesome innovation upon the American system'. He became a member of the Constitutional Committee and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Although he took little part in the debates he assisted (Sir) Samuel Griffith, (Sir) Edmund Barton and Charles Cameron Kingston in revising Griffith's original draft of the adopted constitution on the Queensland government's steam yacht, ''Lucinda''; though he was too ill to be present when the main work was done, his own draft had been the basis for most of Griffith's text. </blockquote>Clark's supporters are quick to point out that 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark's draft,<ref name=\"swindle\" /> and that \"only eight of Inglis Clark\u2019s ninety-six clauses failed to find their way into the final Australian Constitution\";<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neasey|first=Frank|year=1991|title=Andrew Inglis Clark and Australian Federation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=C39CAE7B9E4743FA814AD5759747601D&_z=z|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=13|pages=|via=}}</ref> but these are potentially misleading statistics. As Professor John Williams has pointed out:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=John (Professor)|year=2014|title=Andrew Inglis Clark: Our Constitution and His Influence|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=50F3804219D141609BD6887ECDB41E74&_z=z#_ftn28|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=61|pages=|via=}}</ref><blockquote>It is easy to point to the document and dismiss it as a mere \u2018cut and paste\u2019 from known provisions. While there is some validity in such observations it does tend to overlook the fact that there are very few variations to be added once the basic structure is agreed. So for instance, there was always going to be parts dealing with the executive, the parliament and the judiciary in any Australian constitution. The fact that Inglis Clark modelled his on the American Constitution is no surprise once that basic decision was made. Issues of the respective legislative powers, the role of the states, the power of amendment and financial questions were the detail of the debate that the framers were about to address in 1891.</blockquote>As to who was responsible for the actual detailed drafting, as distinct from the broad structure and framework of the 1891 draft, Professor Williams (for one) is in no doubt:<ref name=\":0\" /><blockquote>In terms of style there can be little argument that Inglis Clark\u2019s Constitution is not as crisp or clean as Kingston\u2019s 1891 draft Constitution. This is not so much a reflection on Inglis Clark, but an acknowledgement of the talents of Charles Kingston and Sir Samuel Griffith as drafters. They were direct and economical with words. The same cannot always be said of Inglis Clark.</blockquote>\n\n== Later constitutional conventions ==\nThe revival of the federal movement stemmed from the growth of federal leagues and nationalist organisations that were committed to federation, such as the [[Australian Natives' Association]]. There were two so-called People's Conventions held in [[Corowa]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].\n[[File:Australia Federation Ribbon2.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|A ribbon produced in Sydney]]\nIn 1893 [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]], who had attended the Corowa convention, drew up a bill which became the basis of discussion at the Adelaide Convention (see below) and is considered to have contributed largely to the eventual constitution. Quick with [[Robert Garran]] went on to publish ''The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth'' in 1901, which is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative works on the Australian Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|title=Closer Look: The Australian Constitution|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|access-date=9 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405180301/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|archive-date=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895 a proposal was accepted by the premiers of the Australian colonies to establish a new Convention by popular vote, with the resulting draft of the constitution being submitted to the electors of each colony in a [[referendum]]. The Convention held meetings over the course of a year, beginning first in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, later meeting in Sydney, and culminating in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of [[responsible government]]. There was also a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen by popular vote with the voters in each State acting as one electorate.\n\nA draft bill was drawn up in 1898, and then sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate. Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four of them, however, the enabling legislation in New South Wales required the support of at least 80,000 voters for passage, and this number was not reached.<ref name=ccwa>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/Documents/federation.pdf|title=Celebrating Federation|publisher=Constitutional Centre of Western Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> A meeting of the colonial premiers in early 1899 agreed to a number of amendments to make the constitution more acceptable to New South Wales.  Known as the \"[[Edward Braddon|Braddon Clause]]\", the amendments provided for the return of customs revenue to the states for ten years.  It was also agreed that the new federal capital was to be built in New South Wales provided it was at least a hundred miles (160&nbsp;km) from Sydney.<ref name=ccwa /> In June 1899, the referendum was held again in all the colonies except for [[Western Australia]], where the vote was not held until the following year.

It was proclaimed on 1&nbsp;January 1901 in [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], Sydney. Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.\n\nThe new constitution established a [[bicameral]] Parliament, containing a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The office of [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government. The Constitution also established a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.\n\nThe site of a federal capital was disputed heavily between the two arch-rivals Sydney and [[Melbourne]]; the compromise was that a separate territory (the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) would be established within New South Wales to hold a new capital, while Parliament would sit in Melbourne until the new city was constructed. The site eventually chosen for the city became [[Canberra]].\n\n==Landmarks named after Federation==\n{{see also|Federation architecture}}\nThe significance of Federation for Australia is such that a number of landmarks, natural and man-made, have been named after it.

All my friends thought I was crazy to do ''Pet Sounds''.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jacopo|last=Benci|title=Brian Wilson interview|journal=Record Collector|date=January 1995|issue=185|location=UK}}</ref> Asher says \"In many of the other songs, when Brian would express a feeling, I would say, 'Oh, yes, I've had those feelings,' maybe not in the same way or the same degree, but I understood them. But this one I didn't relate to. It was more trying to interpret what he was feeling than having this joint feeling in our various ways.\"<ref name=tracks /> In reviewer Donald A. Guercio's interpretation: \"The lyrics are a first-person chronicle of disillusionment from a narrator who, despite being intelligent, can't find a place where he can comfortably feel like a part of the world.\"<ref name=\"IJWMFTTAllMusic\">{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald A.|title=I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/i-just-wasnt-made-for-thesetimes-t2827571|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509140651/http://www.allmusic.com/song/i-just-wasnt-made-for-thesetimes-t2827571|archivedate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Alternatively, author Charles Granata reads the song as a \"plaintive ballad about coming to terms with one's differences\".<ref name=\"Granata\"/> On the relationship between words and music, Guercio elaborates:\n\n{{quote|The music brings the despair of the lyrics to life with a melody that is lovely and pained all at once: The verses rise and fall in a way that accentuates the yearning tone of the lyrics, and the chorus rapidly accelerates to soaring melodic heights before crashing back down to perfectly capture the song's churning emotions. ... Wilson's pained lead vocal is contrasted with layers of anguished harmonies on the chorus. Its instrumentation is similarly powerful, weaving harpsichord and theremin into a spooky orchestral tapestry, and powerful drumming wrings the maximum dramatic punch from each chorus.<ref name=\"IJWMFTTAllMusic\" />}}\n\nLike other songs on ''Pet Sounds'', there is no [[drum kit]] until the chorus.<ref name=\"Hickey2012\"/> Its chorus features background vocals sung in Spanish: \"''Oh, \u00bfcu\u00e1ndo ser\u00e9? Un d\u00eda ser\u00e9''\" (\"When will I be? One day I will be\")<ref name=\"Studio Q\" /> while Wilson leads with the lyric \"''sometimes I feel very sad''\". Each musical bar that follows within the chorus introduces a new contrapuntal melody, where Wilson further adds \"''ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into''\" and \"''people I know don't wanna be where I'm at''\".<ref name=\"Hickey2012\">{{cite book|pp=114\u2013115|last=Hickey|first=Andrew|title=The Beach Boys On CD: Volume 1 1961-1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnMoAwAAQBAJ|year=2011|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4475-4233-9}}</ref> [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] of [[indie pop]] outfit [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] wrote: \"Although he was only twenty-three, there was something incredibly old and incredibly melancholy within Brian Wilson.
