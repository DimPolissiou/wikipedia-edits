Although that river lies a short way outside R\u00fcdesheim, the municipality still styles itself \u201can der Nahe\u201d (\u201con the Nahe\u201d) and claims that it lies ''im Herzen des wundersch\u00f6nen Nahetals'' (\u201cin the heart of the wonderfully lovely Nahe valley\u201d).<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=979 Geographical claims]</ref> The village is found some 4&nbsp;km west of the district seat of [[Bad Kreuznach]], with which it has all but grown together into one built-up area.

There is disagreement over where the village\u2019s current name comes from, with suggestions such as ''Rudersheim'' or ''Rodersheim'' (the former an apparent reference to rowing, and the latter to land clearing). Also in contention as the namesake is a knight of the House of R\u00fcdesheim. Whoever is right, the name does come from Frankish times, like all placenames that end in ''\u2014heim'', ''\u2014hausen'', ''\u2014weiler'' and so on. The wine was brought here by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] legionaries, who could call this place home even before the Franks came. For the epithet \u201cwine village\u201d, R\u00fcdesheim still has the Romans to thank, even now, in the third millennium. In the years 1125 and 1126, the villagers found themselves in a fight against [[famine]] and the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. In 1334, R\u00fcdesheim, along with [[Bockenau]], [[Weinsheim, Bad Kreuznach|Weinsheim]] and [[Sponheim]], was burnt to the ground in the [[feud]] between [[Archbishop of Trier]] [[Baldwin of Luxembourg]] and the [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the village had to deal with military requisitions, plundering and deliberately set blazes. In the wake of all this, the village\u2019s population sank to roughly half what it had been by the time the war ended. The first sewerage was laid in R\u00fcdesheim at the early date of 1661. The [[French Revolution]], too, left its mark on R\u00fcdesheim. In 1794, the village was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary troops]]. On 1 October 1795, the German lands on the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank were [[Annexation|annexed]] to the [[French First Republic]], [[French language|French]] became the official language and the operative constitution was the [[Constitution of the Year III|French one]]. [[Schinderhannes]] (or Johannes B\u00fcckler, to use his true name) supposedly amused himself at the [[inn]] \u201cZum Kr\u00f6nchen\u201d during this time. After [[Napoleon]]\u2019s defeat and the delivery of the terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]], R\u00fcdesheim passed in 1814 or 1815 to joint [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]]-[[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] rule. In 1853, the seat of the ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeisterei'' (\u201c''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' mayoralty\u201d) was established. The ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeistereien'' of R\u00fcdesheim, Wallhausen, Winterburg and Waldb\u00f6ckelheim all took part in 1893 in the planning for the [[Narrow gauge|narrow-gauge]] [[railway]]. Besides passengers, this railway also transported wood from the Soonwald, ore, brownstone and material from the Bockenau [[Quarry|quarries]]. The narrow-gauge railway ran through R\u00fcdesheim along the Ellerbach. The right-of-way is now a street called \u201cIm Wiesengrunde\u201d. The [[railway station]] stood at \u201cAm Kesselberg 8\u201d (at the corner of \u201cIm Wiesengrunde\u201d). At the beginning of the [[First World War]], this report came from R\u00fcdesheim:<blockquote>It was a sweltering August day in the year 1914. In the evening, the whole village gathered in the street. A celebratory calm prevailed. The chairmen of the clubs spoke and all enthusiastically agreed to the ''Kaiserhoch'' (a cheer). There was a parting celebration taking place for the men who were going off to the war. The next morning, one could see at the narrow-gauge railway station parting scenes.</blockquote> In the years that followed, 254 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were assigned to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] work in the R\u00fcdesheim ''B\u00fcrgermeisterei'' (\u201cmayoralty\u201d) region. The time that followed generally brought social and economic hardship, currency devaluation, sometimes [[famine]] and [[coal]] shortages, and [[barter]]ing flourished. In the [[Second World War]], many evacuees came from the Saar to R\u00fcdesheim. Other things that locals had to deal with throughout the war were aerial defence measures, collecting drives, receiving ration cards, standing in queues for groceries and other everyday needs, air-raid alerts, searching for potato beetles, collecting scrap, news from the war, funeral services for the fallen and so on. The [[swimming pool]] was opened in 1939. During the approach to an [[Strategic bombing|air raid]] on [[Bad Kreuznach]], bombs were accidentally dropped on R\u00fcdesheim. When [[United States|American]] [[tank]]s rolled through R\u00fcdesheim on 16 March 1945, the village found itself under [[Allied-occupied Germany|American occupation]]. The [[Wirtschaftswunder|\u201cEconomic Miracle\u201d]] that set in after the war also made itself felt in R\u00fcdesheim: In 1963, sewerage was laid throughout the village. Also that year, a new [[school]] building was dedicated on Schulstra\u00dfe. A [[kindergarten]], too, was opened. New building zones were laid out as well. On 7 June 1969, in the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], R\u00fcdesheim was amalgamated with the town of Bad Kreuznach. The town wanted to expand its industrial park, but R\u00fcdesheimers were mostly against this proposal. R\u00fcdesheim therefore took the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to court. The Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') found in R\u00fcdesheim\u2019s favour on 17 December 1969, and the amalgamation was overturned, splitting the village away from the town once again. In 1970, the old ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeisterei'' became the [[R\u00fcdesheim (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of R\u00fcdesheim]].<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=189 History]</ref> In 1994, the ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 41 bypass was dedicated.\n\n===Population development===\nR\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s population development since [[Napoleon]]ic times is shown in the table below.

Indeed, R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s arms are not even the only ones in the [[Bad Kreuznach (district)|Bad Kreuznach]] [[Districts of Germany|district]] to bear this image, with [[Meddersheim]] and [[Norheim]] likewise bearing arms depicting Martin cutting off a piece of his cloak for a beggar. The arms have been borne since the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] Ministry of the Interior approved them on 5 October 1950, and are based on a court seal from 1569. In villages in this region back in Frankish times, the village court or the ''[[Schulthei\u00df]]'' bore a seal beginning about the 14th century. The main state archive in [[Koblenz]] has two stamps made by R\u00fcdesheim court seals, one on a document from 31 December 1569, and the other from 1731. Depicted on both is Saint Martin, who was [[Sponheim#Sponheim Abbey|Sponheim Abbey\u2019s]] patron saint. The circumscriptions on each, however, are different, namely \u201cGER.SIG.RUEDESHEIM BEI XNACH\u201d and \u201cGER.SIG RIDESHEIM BEY XNACH\u201d respectively, although both mean \u201ccourt seal R\u00fcdesheim near Kreuznach\u201d (\u201cXnach\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cKreuznach\u201d because the first syllable of that name is [[German language|German]] for \u201ccross\u201d, hence the X). Saint Martin, also patron saint of the Sponheim [[church (building)|church]], was adopted as the main [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the coat of arms in 1950. Nevertheless, nobody thought much about what [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] should be applied. The [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]] bore arms chequy azure and Or (a chequered field of alternating blue and gold squares), and although this pattern does appear in many local civic coats of arms ([[Hargesheim]] and [[Roxheim]], for instance), it does not appear in R\u00fcdesheim\u2019s arms, even though the Counts were the local lords in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=1090 Description and explanation of R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s arms]</ref>\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:<ref>[http://denkmallisten.gdke-rlp.de/Bad_Kreuznach.pdf Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district]</ref>\n[[File:Ruedesheim nahe1.jpg|thumb|Roxheimer Stra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 former school]]\n[[File:Ruedesheim nahe3.jpg|thumb|House in R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe]]\n* [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] [[church (building)|church]], Nahestra\u00dfe 36 \u2013 formerly [[Saint George]]\u2019s (''St. Georg''), [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] [[aisleless church]], made over in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], marked 1743 and 1898 (repair work), [[bell tower]] after 1945\n* Kurt-Schumacher-Stra\u00dfe 1 \u2013 Baroque [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house, from the earlier half of the 18th century\n* Nahestra\u00dfe \u2013 warriors\u2019 memorial 1914-1918, display wall with [[relief]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionist]] style elements, 1922, sculptor Arthur Zimmermann, [[Bad Kreuznach]]\n* Nahestra\u00dfe 30 \u2013 Baroque timber-frame house, marked 1699\n* Nahestra\u00dfe 58 \u2013 [[villa]], partly timber-frame, [[Art Nouveau]] 1906, architect Zimmermann\n* Roxheimer Stra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 former [[school]]; Heimatstil, wall fountain, about 1920/1930\n* Sch\u00e4ferstra\u00dfe 1 \u2013 Baroque timber-frame house, plastered, early 18th century\n* Sch\u00e4ferstra\u00dfe 15 \u2013 Baroque estate complex with [[Forge|smithy]], 18th and 19th centuries\n\n===Clubs===\nThe following clubs are active in R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe:<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=972 Clubs]</ref>\n*''Classic Automobile R\u00fcdesheim/Nahe'' (C.A.R.) \u2014 \u201coldtimers\u2019 club\u201d\n*''Gesangverein 1888 R\u00fcdesheim [[Eingetragener Verein|e.V.]]'' \u2014 singing club\n*''R\u00fcdesheimer Freizeitclub e.V.''

Although that river lies a short way outside R\u00fcdesheim, the municipality still styles itself \u201can der Nahe\u201d (\u201con the Nahe\u201d) and claims that it lies ''im Herzen des wundersch\u00f6nen Nahetals'' (\u201cin the heart of the wonderfully lovely Nahe valley\u201d).<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=979 Geographical claims]</ref> The village is found some 4&nbsp;km west of the district seat of [[Bad Kreuznach]], with which it has all but grown together into one built-up area.

There is disagreement over where the village\u2019s current name comes from, with suggestions such as ''Rudersheim'' or ''Rodersheim'' (the former an apparent reference to rowing, and the latter to land clearing). Also in contention as the namesake is a knight of the House of R\u00fcdesheim. Whoever is right, the name does come from Frankish times, like all placenames that end in ''\u2014heim'', ''\u2014hausen'', ''\u2014weiler'' and so on. The wine was brought here by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] legionaries, who could call this place home even before the Franks came. For the epithet \u201cwine village\u201d, R\u00fcdesheim still has the Romans to thank, even now, in the third millennium. In the years 1125 and 1126, the villagers found themselves in a fight against [[famine]] and the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]]. In 1334, R\u00fcdesheim, along with [[Bockenau]], [[Weinsheim, Bad Kreuznach|Weinsheim]] and [[Sponheim]], was burnt to the ground in the [[feud]] between [[Archbishop of Trier]] [[Baldwin of Luxembourg]] and the [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the village had to deal with military requisitions, plundering and deliberately set blazes. In the wake of all this, the village\u2019s population sank to roughly half what it had been by the time the war ended. The first sewerage was laid in R\u00fcdesheim at the early date of 1661. The [[French Revolution]], too, left its mark on R\u00fcdesheim. In 1794, the village was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary troops]]. On 1 October 1795, the German lands on the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank were [[Annexation|annexed]] to the [[French First Republic]], [[French language|French]] became the official language and the operative constitution was the [[Constitution of the Year III|French one]]. [[Schinderhannes]] (or Johannes B\u00fcckler, to use his true name) supposedly amused himself at the [[inn]] \u201cZum Kr\u00f6nchen\u201d during this time. After [[Napoleon]]\u2019s defeat and the delivery of the terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]], R\u00fcdesheim passed in 1814 or 1815 to joint [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]]-[[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] rule. In 1853, the seat of the ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeisterei'' (\u201c''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' mayoralty\u201d) was established. The ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeistereien'' of R\u00fcdesheim, Wallhausen, Winterburg and Waldb\u00f6ckelheim all took part in 1893 in the planning for the [[Narrow gauge|narrow-gauge]] [[railway]]. Besides passengers, this railway also transported wood from the Soonwald, ore, brownstone and material from the Bockenau [[Quarry|quarries]]. The narrow-gauge railway ran through R\u00fcdesheim along the Ellerbach. The right-of-way is now a street called \u201cIm Wiesengrunde\u201d. The [[railway station]] stood at \u201cAm Kesselberg 8\u201d (at the corner of \u201cIm Wiesengrunde\u201d). At the beginning of the [[First World War]], this report came from R\u00fcdesheim:<blockquote>It was a sweltering August day in the year 1914. In the evening, the whole village gathered in the street. A celebratory calm prevailed. The chairmen of the clubs spoke and all enthusiastically agreed to the ''Kaiserhoch'' (a cheer). There was a parting celebration taking place for the men who were going off to the war. The next morning, one could see at the narrow-gauge railway station parting scenes.</blockquote> In the years that followed, 254 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were assigned to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] work in the R\u00fcdesheim ''B\u00fcrgermeisterei'' (\u201cmayoralty\u201d) region. The time that followed generally brought social and economic hardship, currency devaluation, sometimes [[famine]] and [[coal]] shortages, and [[barter]]ing flourished. In the [[Second World War]], many evacuees came from the Saar to R\u00fcdesheim. Other things that locals had to deal with throughout the war were aerial defence measures, collecting drives, receiving ration cards, standing in queues for groceries and other everyday needs, air-raid alerts, searching for potato beetles, collecting scrap, news from the war, funeral services for the fallen and so on. The [[swimming pool]] was opened in 1939. During the approach to an [[Strategic bombing|air raid]] on [[Bad Kreuznach]], bombs were accidentally dropped on R\u00fcdesheim. When [[United States|American]] [[tank]]s rolled through R\u00fcdesheim on 16 March 1945, the village found itself under [[Allied-occupied Germany|American occupation]]. The [[Wirtschaftswunder|\u201cEconomic Miracle\u201d]] that set in after the war also made itself felt in R\u00fcdesheim: In 1963, sewerage was laid throughout the village. Also that year, a new [[school]] building was dedicated on Schulstra\u00dfe. A [[kindergarten]], too, was opened. New building zones were laid out as well. On 7 June 1969, in the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], R\u00fcdesheim was amalgamated with the town of Bad Kreuznach. The town wanted to expand its industrial park, but R\u00fcdesheimers were mostly against this proposal. R\u00fcdesheim therefore took the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to court. The Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') found in R\u00fcdesheim\u2019s favour on 17 December 1969, and the amalgamation was overturned, splitting the village away from the town once again. In 1970, the old ''Amtsb\u00fcrgermeisterei'' became the [[R\u00fcdesheim (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of R\u00fcdesheim]].<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=189 History]</ref> In 1994, the ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 41 bypass was dedicated.\n\n===Population development===\nR\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s population development since [[Napoleon]]ic times is shown in the table below.

Indeed, R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s arms are not even the only ones in the [[Bad Kreuznach (district)|Bad Kreuznach]] [[Districts of Germany|district]] to bear this image, with [[Meddersheim]] and [[Norheim]] likewise bearing arms depicting Martin cutting off a piece of his cloak for a beggar. The arms have been borne since the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] Ministry of the Interior approved them on 5 October 1950, and are based on a court seal from 1569. In villages in this region back in Frankish times, the village court or the ''[[Schulthei\u00df]]'' bore a seal beginning about the 14th century. The main state archive in [[Koblenz]] has two stamps made by R\u00fcdesheim court seals, one on a document from 31 December 1569, and the other from 1731. Depicted on both is Saint Martin, who was [[Sponheim#Sponheim Abbey|Sponheim Abbey\u2019s]] patron saint. The circumscriptions on each, however, are different, namely \u201cGER.SIG.RUEDESHEIM BEI XNACH\u201d and \u201cGER.SIG RIDESHEIM BEY XNACH\u201d respectively, although both mean \u201ccourt seal R\u00fcdesheim near Kreuznach\u201d (\u201cXnach\u201d was an abbreviation for \u201cKreuznach\u201d because the first syllable of that name is [[German language|German]] for \u201ccross\u201d, hence the X). Saint Martin, also patron saint of the Sponheim [[church (building)|church]], was adopted as the main [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the coat of arms in 1950. Nevertheless, nobody thought much about what [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] should be applied. The [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]] bore arms chequy azure and Or (a chequered field of alternating blue and gold squares), and although this pattern does appear in many local civic coats of arms ([[Hargesheim]] and [[Roxheim]], for instance), it does not appear in R\u00fcdesheim\u2019s arms, even though the Counts were the local lords in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=1090 Description and explanation of R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe\u2019s arms]</ref>\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:<ref>[http://denkmallisten.gdke-rlp.de/Bad_Kreuznach.pdf Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district]</ref>\n[[File:Ruedesheim nahe1.jpg|thumb|Roxheimer Stra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 former school]]\n[[File:Ruedesheim nahe3.jpg|thumb|House in R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe]]\n* [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] [[church (building)|church]], Nahestra\u00dfe 36 \u2013 formerly [[Saint George]]\u2019s (''St. Georg''), [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] [[aisleless church]], made over in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], marked 1743 and 1898 (repair work), [[bell tower]] after 1945\n* Kurt-Schumacher-Stra\u00dfe 1 \u2013 Baroque [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house, from the earlier half of the 18th century\n* Nahestra\u00dfe \u2013 warriors\u2019 memorial 1914-1918, display wall with [[relief]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionist]] style elements, 1922, sculptor Arthur Zimmermann, [[Bad Kreuznach]]\n* Nahestra\u00dfe 30 \u2013 Baroque timber-frame house, marked 1699\n* Nahestra\u00dfe 58 \u2013 [[villa]], partly timber-frame, [[Art Nouveau]] 1906, architect Zimmermann\n* Roxheimer Stra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 former [[school]]; Heimatstil, wall fountain, about 1920/1930\n* Sch\u00e4ferstra\u00dfe 1 \u2013 Baroque timber-frame house, plastered, early 18th century\n* Sch\u00e4ferstra\u00dfe 15 \u2013 Baroque estate complex with [[Forge|smithy]], 18th and 19th centuries\n\n===Clubs===\nThe following clubs are active in R\u00fcdesheim an der Nahe:<ref>[http://www.ruedesheim-nahe.de/wp/?page_id=972 Clubs]</ref>\n*''Classic Automobile R\u00fcdesheim/Nahe'' (C.A.R.) \u2014 \u201coldtimers\u2019 club\u201d\n*''Gesangverein 1888 R\u00fcdesheim [[Eingetragener Verein|e.V.]]'' \u2014 singing club\n*''R\u00fcdesheimer Freizeitclub e.V.''

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C.

Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-a-horror-game-for-cowards-415904.phtml |last=Cosimano |first=Mike |title=Hello Neighbor is a horror game for cowards |website=Destructoid |date=1 February 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> However, the player can use the game settings to turn on friendly neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/m126j/hello-neighbor-friendly-mode-changes|title=Hello Neighbor Friendly Mode Changes|last=Arthur|first=Ty|date=2017-12-11|website=www.gameskinny.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played in a [[first-person (gaming)|first-person perspective]], and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them). Up to four items can be kept in an inventory space.

Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his [[basement]]. Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground [[dungeon]], but finds no signiifyihuiuhtohuuthufihvf of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Rhnjlirjjglibjirgjfriguufguubudkuytorghdfufdegoggwcuo iwrfufu\nNicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase.  \n\nThroughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt.\n\nNicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small house, locking a much smaller shadow man in another room. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was released as an [[alpha build]] on Dynamic Pixels' website in 2015. It was later approved for sale as an [[early access]] game by the [[Steam Greenlight]] program and a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to fund further development. The studio signed a deal with [[tinyBuild]] to publish the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |title=Hello Neighbor...Not Exactly Welcome Wagon |last=Munger |first=Karla |website=www.justadventure.com |date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010004/http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |archive-date=29 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first pre-alpha version of the game was released in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/29/13112994/hello-neighbor-trailer-home-invasion-simulator-pc-2017 |last=Frank |first=Allegra |title=Hello Neighbor is a voyeuristic indie home invasion simulator |date=29 September 2016 |website=Polygon |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-unexpectedly-terrifying-315677.phtml |last=Devorre |first=Jordan |title=Hello, Neighbor! is unexpectedly terrifying |website=Destructoid |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiegames.com/2015/06/hello_neighbour_encourages_bre.html |last=Flint |first=Sean |title=IndieGames.com Hello, Neighbour!

The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-a-horror-game-for-cowards-415904.phtml |last=Cosimano |first=Mike |title=Hello Neighbor is a horror game for cowards |website=Destructoid |date=1 February 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> However, the player can use the game settings to turn on friendly neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/m126j/hello-neighbor-friendly-mode-changes|title=Hello Neighbor Friendly Mode Changes|last=Arthur|first=Ty|date=2017-12-11|website=www.gameskinny.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played in a [[first-person (gaming)|first-person perspective]], and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them). Up to four items can be kept in an inventory space. Items of the same kind cannot be stacked together in one slot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/10/11/test-chamber-trespassing-into-a-strangers-home-in-hello-neighbor.aspx |last=Favis |first=Elise |title=Test Chamber \u2013 Trespassing Into A Stranger's Home In Hello Neighbor |website=Game Informer |date=11 October 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Hello Neighbor Screenshot.png|thumb|The neighbor's house as it appears at the beginning of the game.]]\nA child named Nicky Roth is playing in the street when he hears a scream from his neighbor's house. Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his [[basement]]. Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground [[dungeon]], but finds no sign of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Nicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase.  \n\nThroughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt.\n\nNicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small house, locking a much smaller shadow man in another room. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was released as an [[alpha build]] on Dynamic Pixels' website in 2015. It was later approved for sale as an [[early access]] game by the [[Steam Greenlight]] program and a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to fund further development. The studio signed a deal with [[tinyBuild]] to publish the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |title=Hello Neighbor...Not Exactly Welcome Wagon |last=Munger |first=Karla |website=www.justadventure.com |date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010004/http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |archive-date=29 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first pre-alpha version of the game was released in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/29/13112994/hello-neighbor-trailer-home-invasion-simulator-pc-2017 |last=Frank |first=Allegra |title=Hello Neighbor is a voyeuristic indie home invasion simulator |date=29 September 2016 |website=Polygon |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-unexpectedly-terrifying-315677.phtml |last=Devorre |first=Jordan |title=Hello, Neighbor! is unexpectedly terrifying |website=Destructoid |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiegames.com/2015/06/hello_neighbour_encourages_bre.html |last=Flint |first=Sean |title=IndieGames.com Hello, Neighbour!

Spinoza's French school and the supporters of deism were but two sects disputing over the true meaning of his system....\"\n\nIn [[George Henry Lewes]]'s words (1846), \"Pantheism is as old as philosophy.

Indeed, one may say that Pantheism, under one of its various shapes, is the necessary consequence of all metaphysical inquiry, when pushed to its logical limits; and from this reason do we find it in every age and nation. The dreamy contemplative Indian, the quick versatile Greek, the practical Roman, the quibbling Scholastic, the ardent Italian, the lively Frenchman, and the bold Englishman, have all pronounced it as the final truth of philosophy. Wherein consists Spinoza's originality? \u2014 what is his merit? \u2014 are natural questions, when we see him only lead to the same result as others had before proclaimed. His merit and originality consist in the systematic exposition and development of that doctrine \u2014 in his hands, for the first time, it assumes the aspect of a science. The Greek and Indian Pantheism is a vague fanciful doctrine, carrying with it no scientific conviction; it may be true \u2014 it looks true \u2014 but the proof is wanting. But with Spinoza there is no choice: if you understand his terms, admit the possibility of his science, and seize his meaning; you can no more doubt his conclusions than you can doubt [[Euclid]]; no mere opinion is possible, conviction only is possible.\"<ref>Lewes, George Henry: ''A Biographical History of Philosophy, Volumes III & IV''.

Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that pantheism shares more characteristics of [[theism]] than of atheism.

Moreover, they do not define the meaning of \"real\".\n\n===Other===\nIn 1896, J. H. Worman, a theologian, identified seven categories of pantheism: Mechanical or materialistic (God the mechanical unity of existence); Ontological (fundamental unity, Spinoza); Dynamic; Psychical (God is the soul of the world); Ethical (God is the universal moral order, Fichte; Logical (Hegel); and Pure (absorption of God into nature, which Worman equates with atheism).<ref name=Worman/>\n\nMore recently, [[Paul D. Feinberg]], professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, also identified seven: Hylozoistic; Immanentistic; Absolutistic monistic; Relativistic monistic; Acosmic; Identity of opposites; and Neoplatonic or emanationistic.<ref>''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'', edited by Walter A. Elwell, p. 887</ref>\n\n== Related concepts ==\n[[Nature worship]] or nature mysticism is often conflated and confused with pantheism. It is pointed out by at least one expert, Harold Wood, founder of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]], that in pantheist philosophy Spinoza's identification of God with nature is very different from a recent idea of a self identifying pantheist with environmental ethical concerns. His use of the word [[nature]] to describe his worldview may be vastly different from the \"nature\" of modern sciences. He and other nature mystics who also identify as pantheists use \"nature\" to refer to the limited [[natural environment]] (as opposed to man-made [[built environment]]). This use of \"nature\" is different from the broader use from Spinoza and other pantheists describing natural laws and the overall phenomena of the physical world. Nature mysticism may be compatible with pantheism but it may also be compatible with theism and other views.<ref name=\"LevineDetailed\">Levine, Michael, Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Psychology Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780415070645}}, pgs 44, 274-275.\n* \"The idea that Unity that is rooted in nature is what types of nature mysticism (e.g. Wordsworth, Robinson Jeffers, Gary Snyder) have in common with more philosophically robust versions of pantheism.

Spinoza's French school and the supporters of deism were but two sects disputing over the true meaning of his system....\"\n\nIn [[George Henry Lewes]]'s words (1846), \"Pantheism is as old as philosophy. It was taught in the old Greek schools \u2014 by [[Plato]], by [[St. Augustine]], and by the [[Jew]]s. Indeed, one may say that Pantheism, under one of its various shapes, is the necessary consequence of all metaphysical inquiry, when pushed to its logical limits; and from this reason do we find it in every age and nation. The dreamy contemplative Indian, the quick versatile Greek, the practical Roman, the quibbling Scholastic, the ardent Italian, the lively Frenchman, and the bold Englishman, have all pronounced it as the final truth of philosophy. Wherein consists Spinoza's originality? \u2014 what is his merit? \u2014 are natural questions, when we see him only lead to the same result as others had before proclaimed. His merit and originality consist in the systematic exposition and development of that doctrine \u2014 in his hands, for the first time, it assumes the aspect of a science. The Greek and Indian Pantheism is a vague fanciful doctrine, carrying with it no scientific conviction; it may be true \u2014 it looks true \u2014 but the proof is wanting. But with Spinoza there is no choice: if you understand his terms, admit the possibility of his science, and seize his meaning; you can no more doubt his conclusions than you can doubt [[Euclid]]; no mere opinion is possible, conviction only is possible.\"<ref>Lewes, George Henry: ''A Biographical History of Philosophy, Volumes III & IV''.

A generation before him Bruno conveyed a similar message to humanity. Yet Bruno is merely a beautiful episode in the history of the human mind, while Spinoza is one of its most potent forces.

Lessing stated that he knew no other philosophy than Spinozism.\nJacobi's ''\u00dcber die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the enmity of the Berlin group, led by Mendelssohn. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]].

Elwell, p. 887</ref>\n\n== Related concepts ==\n[[Nature worship]] or nature mysticism is often conflated and confused with pantheism. It is pointed out by at least one expert, Harold Wood, founder of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]], that in pantheist philosophy Spinoza's identification of God with nature is very different from a recent idea of a self identifying pantheist with environmental ethical concerns. His use of the word [[nature]] to describe his worldview may be vastly different from the \"nature\" of modern sciences. He and other nature mystics who also identify as pantheists use \"nature\" to refer to the limited [[natural environment]] (as opposed to man-made [[built environment]]). This use of \"nature\" is different from the broader use from Spinoza and other pantheists describing natural laws and the overall phenomena of the physical world. Nature mysticism may be compatible with pantheism but it may also be compatible with theism and other views.<ref name=\"LevineDetailed\">Levine, Michael, Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Psychology Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780415070645}}, pgs 44, 274-275.\n* \"The idea that Unity that is rooted in nature is what types of nature mysticism (e.g. Wordsworth, Robinson Jeffers, Gary Snyder) have in common with more philosophically robust versions of pantheism.

The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events. Dioceses with large Vietnamese populations set up large tents to sell traditional [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese food]]. Proceeds go to the parishes, orphanages, or a diocese in Vietnam such as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phu Cuong|Ph\u00fa C\u01b0\u1eddng]].

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events.

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the procession, the Pontifical Mass is celebrated in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These two celebrations are the central point of Marian Days every year. On Sunday, the closing Pontifical Mass is celebrated. Before Mass ends, the director for that year's Marian Days announces when the next Marian Days are, and then he officially closes Marian Days.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/ Chi D\u00f2ng \u0110\u1ed3ng C\u00f4ng Hoa K\u1ef3]&nbsp;\u2013 organizer website\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/NTM/NTM2012/7-4-12/07-04-2012.htm 2012]&nbsp;\u2013 event history\n<!-- *{{in lang|vi}} [http://dongcong.net/Indexntm05.htm Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu 2005]\u00a0\u2013 2005 event website -->\n*[http://www.carthagepd.org/citizens-academy/marian-days/ Marian Days \u2013 Carthage Police Department]\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church in the United States]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American history]]\n[[Category:Overseas Vietnamese religious buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:Asian-American culture in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Catholic Mariology]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1978]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Missouri]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Cooltravis778", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Days"}
