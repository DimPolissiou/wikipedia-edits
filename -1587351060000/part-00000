He and his family rebelled against the Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582\u2013602). The main source about him is [[John of Niki\u00fb]].<ref name=\"PLRE\">{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=1\u20132}}.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nAbaskiron was reportedly a native of Aykilah (Zawiya), a town in the vicinity of [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]]. He was born to a wealthy family, the eldest of three brothers. His younger brothers were Menas and Iacobus ([[Jacob (name)|Jacob]], [[James (name)|James]]). He also had a son, Isaac.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/><ref name=\"Butcher\">{{harvnb|Butcher|1897|loc=Chapter XXIX: \"The Revolt of the Brothers\"}}.</ref>\n\nAbaskiron is first mentioned as a [[scribe]]. He might have been a [[school|scholastic]] (schoolman) and/or [[Philologist|grammarian]].<ref name=\"PLRE\"/> John, the praefectus augustalis (Augustal Prefect, [[List of rulers of Egypt|governor of Egypt]]) appointed Abaskiron, Menas, Iacobus and Isaac as overseers over areas of Egypt. They used their position to perform unauthorized attacks on the local representatives of the Blue faction of [[Chariot racing]], going as far as sacking the towns of Bana and Bousir. They set fire on the [[Thermae]] of Bousir.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/><ref name=\"Butcher\"/>\n\nThe local prefect of Bousir managed to escape to [[Constantinople]], reporting the situation to Emperor Maurice (r. 582\u2013602).<ref name=\"Butcher\"/> Maurice directed John to dismiss Abaskiron and his family from service. They reacted by openly rebelling against Maurice. They led armed followers in seizing the grain ships heading to Alexandria, resulting in a [[famine]] within the capital of Egypt.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/> The population of Alexandria rose against John, blaming him for the famine. His life was reportedly rescued by loyal members of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].<ref name=\"Butcher\"/> John was briefly replaced by Paul, but then was reinstated and tasked with ending the rebellion.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/>\n\nThe activities of the rebels extended throughout Egypt. They continued to seize grain ships and confiscate imperial revenues with Isaac managing to form a naval fleet and raid [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]]. His ships patrolled the Egyptian coast and attacked all ships still in imperial service.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/><ref name=\"Butcher\"/> [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] (term 581-607) was sent to negotiate with the insurgents, to no real effect.<ref name=\"Butcher\"/>\n\nJohn finally moved against them, alongside the general Theodore. By then, Abaskiron and his family controlled most of [[Lower Egypt]].<ref name=\"PLRE\"/><ref name=\"Butcher\"/> Theodore deduced that supporters of the rebellion were partly motivated by the recent arrest and imprisonment of two highly respected figures: Cosmas, son of Samuel and Banon, son of Ammon.

He was born to a wealthy family, the eldest of three brothers. His younger brothers were Menas and Iacobus ([[Jacob (name)|Jacob]], [[James (name)|James]]).

He might have been a [[school|scholastic]] (schoolman) and/or [[Philologist|grammarian]].<ref name=\"PLRE\"/> John, the praefectus augustalis (Augustal Prefect, [[List of rulers of Egypt|governor of Egypt]]) appointed Abaskiron, Menas, Iacobus and Isaac as overseers over areas of Egypt. They used their position to perform unauthorized attacks on the local representatives of the Blue faction of [[Chariot racing]], going as far as sacking the towns of Bana and Bousir. They set fire on the [[Thermae]] of Bousir.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/><ref name=\"Butcher\"/>\n\nThe local prefect of Bousir managed to escape to [[Constantinople]], reporting the situation to Emperor Maurice (r. 582\u2013602).<ref name=\"Butcher\"/> Maurice directed John to dismiss Abaskiron and his family from service. They reacted by openly rebelling against Maurice. They led armed followers in seizing the grain ships heading to Alexandria, resulting in a [[famine]] within the capital of Egypt.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/> The population of Alexandria rose against John, blaming him for the famine. His life was reportedly rescued by loyal members of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].<ref name=\"Butcher\"/> John was briefly replaced by Paul, but then was reinstated and tasked with ending the rebellion.<ref name=\"PLRE\"/>\n\nThe activities of the rebels extended throughout Egypt.

Indeed, the first settlement of the town predates the county by 11 years. In 1850 the village incorporated into a borough. As one of the three original towns of Clarion County, it was once in consideration for the county seat. Due to the political turmoil of the time, it was elected to erect a new, separate municipality to hold the county offices in Clarion, Pennsylvania only three miles away. Strattanville still has many auspices of this age in its history. The old school house now houses the local American Legion. The original store owned by Mr. Strattan still stands at the southeastern corner of Market St. and Main St. However, only the drug and furniture store are easily identifiable of the \"four dry goods and grocery stores, a postoffice, one drug store, one hardware store, one foundry, two boot and shoe shops, two millinery establishments, one blacksmith shop, one tannery, one furniture store and undertaking establishment, one barber shop, a Western Union telegraph office, two hotels, one livery stable, and a lumber office\" <ref>http://history.rays-place.com/pa/clar-strittanville.htm</ref> that once populated the borough.\n\n==Geography==\nStrattanville is located in eastern Clarion County at {{coord|41|12|9|N|79|19|44|W|type:city}} (41.202482, -79.328934).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> [[U.S. Route 322]] passes through the borough, leading west {{convert|3|mi|0}} to [[Clarion, Pennsylvania|Clarion]], the [[county seat]], and east {{convert|4.5|mi}} to [[Interstate 80]].

Indeed, the first settlement of the town predates the county by 11 years. In 1850 the village incorporated into a borough. As one of the three original towns of Clarion County, it was once in consideration for the county seat. Due to the political turmoil of the time, it was elected to erect a new, separate municipality to hold the county offices in Clarion, Pennsylvania only three miles away. Strattanville still has many auspices of this age in its history. The old school house now houses the local American Legion. The original store owned by Mr. Strattan still stands at the southeastern corner of Market St. and Main St. However, only the drug and furniture store are easily identifiable of the \"four dry goods and grocery stores, a postoffice, one drug store, one hardware store, one foundry, two boot and shoe shops, two millinery establishments, one blacksmith shop, one tannery, one furniture store and undertaking establishment, one barber shop, a Western Union telegraph office, two hotels, one livery stable, and a lumber office\" <ref>http://history.rays-place.com/pa/clar-strittanville.htm</ref> that once populated the borough.\n\n==Geography==\nStrattanville is located in eastern Clarion County at {{coord|41|12|9|N|79|19|44|W|type:city}} (41.202482, -79.328934).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> [[U.S. Route 322]] passes through the borough, leading west {{convert|3|mi|0}} to [[Clarion, Pennsylvania|Clarion]], the [[county seat]], and east {{convert|4.5|mi}} to [[Interstate 80]].
