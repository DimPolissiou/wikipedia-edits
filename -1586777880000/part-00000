It was written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9 herself and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Conceived by the latter following an infuriating meeting with a record label, the song was presented to Beyonc\u00e9 who decided to record it following similar experiences in the [[music industry]]. The song was inspired by the works of English musician [[Aphex Twin]] and contains a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] [[rapping|rap]].\n\nMusically, it consists of two parts titled \"'''Ghost'''\" and \"'''Haunted'''\". A predominantly [[trip hop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, it contains a minimalistic sound with keyboards, [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and percussion. Beyonc\u00e9 raps the [[spoken word]] segment of \"Ghost\" with robotic and [[Reverberation|reverbed]] vocals. Lyrically, \"Haunted\" contains sexually explicit and frank lyrics talking about desire. Many [[music journalism|music critics]] compared its sound with various artists and noted different influences and elements explored in its composition. Upon its release, the song was met with positive reviews, with critics praising its experimentalistic sound and the minimalistic approach.\n\nTwo accompanying music videos were filmed for both parts of the song and placed separately on the visual album. The clip for \"Ghost\" was directed by Pierre Debusschere while [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] served as the director for the second part, \"Haunted\". The former visual shows various close-up shots of Beyonc\u00e9 lip-syncing the lyrics, while the latter features her walking in the corridor of a big [[mansion]] meeting various actors seen inside the rooms. Critics compared the video of \"Haunted\" and the singer's look with works by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], most notably with her song \"[[Justify My Love]]\" (1990). The song was performed live during the last European leg of [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and at the [[On the Run Tour (Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] in 2014. Beyonc\u00e9 also performed it at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] as part of a medley consisting of songs from her fifth studio album.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The things people say in those meetings would take your breath away.

Beyonc\u00e9 liked the song upon hearing it, leaving Boots confused as he felt the song was only showcasing his sad vocals, with a piano recorded on his [[iPhone]] as a voice memo.<ref name=\"boots\" />\n\nHe also played her the [[rap]] of [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] of \"Ghost\" during one of their early meetings inspired by an infuriating meeting with a record label. Beyonc\u00e9 could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about the sound of her music. For the music of \"Ghost\", Boots created a beat from a \"dreamlike, hypnotic place\" working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Boots said, \"[Aphex Twin's] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling.\"<ref name=\"boots\" /> He also elaborated about its concept, \"It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going.

The video's set and the singer's style were compared to that of Madonna in her video \"Justify My Love\" (1990)]]\nThe video opens with a three-second film [[countdown]] and proceeds with shots of several empty rooms and televisions in a big [[mansion]]. Most of the scenes were shot at the Villa de Leon. Beyonc\u00e9 is seen driving a car and eventually arriving at the mansion while a song is played in the background. She enters inside the building with two luggages embellished with the letter \"B\" and throws her coat on the ground while a servant is seen lighting a cigarette she had previously taken from her hair. He hands her a key and the singer is seen climbing up the stairs. As she arrives in the hallway on the second floor, the song starts playing in the background and Beyonc\u00e9 starts a journey, looking from room to room as she goes forward in the corridor.\n\nIn the various rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes staring at her as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being surrounded by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four [[mannequin]]s in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyonc\u00e9 is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyonc\u00e9 performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent.<ref name=\"fashionista\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/12/19/fashion/BEYONCE-FASHION-ALBUM-7.html|title=Beyonc\u00e9's 'Visual Album' Fashions|work=The New York Times|page=7|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer [[Ulyana Sergeenko]].<ref name=\"Russian\" /> Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is [[Marcelling|marcelled]] and blonde.<ref name=\"Cochrane\" />\n\n====Reception====\nAnupa Mistry from ''Spin'' wrote that the location where the video was filmed was filled with \"freaks and weirdos\" to channel Madonna during the 1990s in a better way.<ref name=\"Mistry\" /> Lauren Cochrane of ''The Guardian'' wrote in her review of the video that it was a \"homage\" to Madonna with the suit and [[marcel wave]] Beyonc\u00e9 had.

It was written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9 herself and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Conceived by the latter following an infuriating meeting with a record label, the song was presented to Beyonc\u00e9 who decided to record it following similar experiences in the [[music industry]]. The song was inspired by the works of English musician [[Aphex Twin]] and contains a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] [[rapping|rap]].\n\nMusically, it consists of two parts titled \"'''Ghost'''\" and \"'''Haunted'''\". A predominantly [[trip hop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, it contains a minimalistic sound with keyboards, [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and percussion. Beyonc\u00e9 raps the [[spoken word]] segment of \"Ghost\" with robotic and [[Reverberation|reverbed]] vocals. Lyrically, \"Haunted\" contains sexually explicit and frank lyrics talking about desire. Many [[music journalism|music critics]] compared its sound with various artists and noted different influences and elements explored in its composition. Upon its release, the song was met with positive reviews, with critics praising its experimentalistic sound and the minimalistic approach.\n\nTwo accompanying music videos were filmed for both parts of the song and placed separately on the visual album. The clip for \"Ghost\" was directed by Pierre Debusschere while [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] served as the director for the second part, \"Haunted\". The former visual shows various close-up shots of Beyonc\u00e9 lip-syncing the lyrics, while the latter features her walking in the corridor of a big [[mansion]] meeting various actors seen inside the rooms. Critics compared the video of \"Haunted\" and the singer's look with works by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], most notably with her song \"[[Justify My Love]]\" (1990). The song was performed live during the last European leg of [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and at the [[On the Run Tour (Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] in 2014. Beyonc\u00e9 also performed it at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] as part of a medley consisting of songs from her fifth studio album.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The things people say in those meetings would take your breath away.

Beyonc\u00e9 liked the song upon hearing it, leaving Boots confused as he felt the song was only showcasing his sad vocals, with a piano recorded on his [[iPhone]] as a voice memo.<ref name=\"boots\" />\n\nHe also played her the [[rap]] of [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] of \"Ghost\" during one of their early meetings inspired by an infuriating meeting with a record label. Beyonc\u00e9 could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about the sound of her music. For the music of \"Ghost\", Boots created a beat from a \"dreamlike, hypnotic place\" working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Boots said, \"[Aphex Twin's] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling.\"<ref name=\"boots\" /> He also elaborated about its concept, \"It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going.

The video's set and the singer's style were compared to that of Madonna in her video \"Justify My Love\" (1990)]]\nThe video opens with a three-second film [[countdown]] and proceeds with shots of several empty rooms and televisions in a big [[mansion]]. Most of the scenes were shot at the Villa de Leon. Beyonc\u00e9 is seen driving a car and eventually arriving at the mansion while a song is played in the background. She enters inside the building with two luggages embellished with the letter \"B\" and throws her coat on the ground while a servant is seen lighting a cigarette she had previously taken from her hair. He hands her a key and the singer is seen climbing up the stairs. As she arrives in the hallway on the second floor, the song starts playing in the background and Beyonc\u00e9 starts a journey, looking from room to room as she goes forward in the corridor.\n\nIn the various rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes staring at her as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being surrounded by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four [[mannequin]]s in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyonc\u00e9 is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyonc\u00e9 performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent.<ref name=\"fashionista\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/12/19/fashion/BEYONCE-FASHION-ALBUM-7.html|title=Beyonc\u00e9's 'Visual Album' Fashions|work=The New York Times|page=7|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer [[Ulyana Sergeenko]].<ref name=\"Russian\" /> Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is [[Marcelling|marcelled]] and blonde.<ref name=\"Cochrane\" />\n\n====Reception====\nAnupa Mistry from ''Spin'' wrote that the location where the video was filmed was filled with \"freaks and weirdos\" to channel Madonna during the 1990s in a better way.<ref name=\"Mistry\" /> Lauren Cochrane of ''The Guardian'' wrote in her review of the video that it was a \"homage\" to Madonna with the suit and [[marcel wave]] Beyonc\u00e9 had.

{"title_page": "Cathy's Key", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{notability|date=June 2011}}\n'''''Cathy\u2019s Key''''' (2008) is a novel continuing the storyline established in the first part of its series, ''[[Cathy's Book]]'' (2006).  The story is written by [[Sean Stewart]] and [[Jordan Weisman]], and illustrated by [[Cathy Briggs]].\n\nAs did its predecessor, the book takes the form of a 216-page journal written by the protagonist, Cathy Vickers.  The book immediately picks up after book one of the series concludes, and follows Cathy in her quest to discover more about the mysterious and dangerous world of the immortals.  Although many of the same characters (Emma, Cathy\u2019s best friend, and Victor, Cathy\u2019s boyfriend) are involved in the plot, there are also new characters introduced that complicate the storyline.  For instance, a stranger met on a bus trip has developed by the end of the book into a major character, and new relatives such as Tsao, Victor\u2019s father, appear in surprising and sometimes disturbing ways.  At its most basic level, the plot involves Cathy attempting to navigate the treacherous world that the immortals inhabit while not imperiling herself or those she loves.  Although high school graduation has come and passed and Cathy still doesn't have a job, she manages to keep busy by avoiding lovestruck immortals, trying to help her boyfriend discover the key to immortality, and in her free time delving into the mystery surrounding her father\u2019s death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koelling|first=Holly|title=Cathy's Key: If Found Call (650) 266-8202|journal=Booklist|date=July 2008|volume=104|issue=21}}</ref> Although the story ends in another dramatic cliffhanger that leaves much to be resolved, Cathy\u2019s saga continues in the third installation of the series, ''[[Cathy\u2019s Ring]]'' (2010).\n\n==Form==\n''Cathy\u2019s Key'' follows the tradition established by its predecessor in presenting the story in a radically innovative way.
