The city is also part of the Tulsa [[Combined Statistical Area]], with a population of 1,151,172 in 2015.\n\nBartlesville is notable as the longtime home of [[Phillips Petroleum Company]]. [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]] founded Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville in 1905 when the area was still an [[Indian Territory]]. The company merged with [[Conoco]] as [[ConocoPhillips]] and later split into the two independent companies, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips.

He settled first at Silver Lake, a natural lake south of the present city of Bartlesville. In 1874, he opened a trading post and post office on Turkey Creek, in what is now East Bartlesville. In the following year, he bought a grist mill on the [[Caney River]] and modified it to produce flour. Bartles then built a two-story general store and residence, and added a rooming house, a blacksmith shop and a livery stable. Other settlers soon moved into the immediate area, which was then called Bartles Town. In 1880, Bartles moved his Turkey Creek post office to this town. Bartles then provided the community with electricity, a  telephone system and a water distribution system.<ref name = \"EOHC-Bartlesville\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BA026 May, Jon D. \"Bartlesville.\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.] Retrieved January 15, 2012.</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the present city began after William Johnstone and George B. Keeler opened a general store on the south side of the Caney River in 1884. The first newspaper, ''The Weekly Magnet'', began publication in March 1895. The town was incorporated in [[Indian Territory]] in January 1897. The town was surveyed and platted in 1898, and eighty acres were offered to the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] for a depot. The railroad reached the town in 1899. The post office was moved from \"North Bartlesville\" in 1899. Bypassed by the railroad, Jacob Bartles moved his store to [[Dewey, Oklahoma]].<ref name = \"EOHC-Bartlesville\"/>\n\nBartlesville was originally a [[sundown town]] where African Americans were not allowed to live.

The original Kress Building has been taken over by Bartlesville Monthly Magazine and restored with the Frank Phillips Club on the first floor. The original Jane Phillips Memorial Hospital is about to undergo historic preservation for reuse as lofts, as downtown is so full of young professionals that the many developed historic lofts all have a long waiting list, and nearly 20 new retail and restaurant businesses have recently opened downtown, including Indian Coffee, Lubella's Boutique, and Hideaway Pizza.<ref name=\"Downtown Bartlesville Inc\"/> Downtown Bartlesville Inc., the Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority, the Bartlesville Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Bartlesville Development Authority work in tandem to promote this thriving \"Next City\".<ref>Angelou Economics Study, new, and Downtown Bartlesville, Inc.</ref>\n\nFrank Phillips's former home is a museum maintained by the Oklahoma Historical Society. His ranch and retreat about {{convert|10|mi|km}} southwest of Bartlesville is called  [[Woolaroc]] (a [[portmanteau]] of the words '''''woo'''ds'', '''''la'''kes'', '''''roc'''ks''). A working ranch of {{convert|3,700|acre}}, Woolaroc houses a museum exhibiting Phillips's extensive collections of Native American, western, and fine art. It holds one of the most complete private collections of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] [[firearms]] in the world.

Some students also attend Tulsa-area private high schools.\n\n==Transportation==\nBartlesville is served by two US Highways and one Oklahoma state highway: \n\n*[[U.S. Route 75 in Oklahoma|US-75]] is the primary north-south US highway through Bartlesville and Washington County. It follows Washington Boulevard from Minnesota Street as it comes out of the nearby city of [[Dewey, Oklahoma|Dewey]] to the north and Washington County Road W. 2400 to the south. The city limits stretch just to the south of the Walmart Distribution Center on US-75/Washington County Road W. 3000, east of the town of Ochelata. US-75 continues south into [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].\n*[[U.S. Route 60 in Oklahoma|US-60]] is the primary east-west US highway in Bartlesville and Washington County. It follows Nowata Road, east of SE Bison Road on the city's east side to Washington Boulevard (US-75). The highway continues north, where it follows Washington Boulevard (US-75) to the Washington Boulevard/Adams Road interchange. From the Washington Boulevard/Adams Road interchange, US-60 departs US-75 and continues west, where it follows Adams Road to Western Street. From Adams Road, it continues north on Western Street (OK-123) to the Western Street/Frank Phillips Boulevard/Hensley Boulevard intersection, where the highway exits to the west, toward [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma|Pawhuska]]. Western Street rests on the Washington/Osage County Line.\n*[[Oklahoma State Highway 123|SH-123]] follows Bartles Road coming from the west side of Dewey as it crosses the Caney River Bridge just north of Hensley Boulevard. The highway turns west and runs along Hensley Boulevard for approximately {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} to the Hensley Boulevard/Frank Phillips Boulevard/Western Street intersection. The highway runs a brief distance along US-60, departing at Adams Road. SH-123 then departs Bartlesville to the southwest toward [[Barnsdall, Oklahoma|Barnsdall]] in Osage County.\n\n===Airport and aviation===\nBartlesville Municipal Airport sits on the city's west side on US-60 in Osage County.<ref>[https://www.cityofbartlesville.org/city-services/municipal-airport/ Bartlesville Municipal Airport]</ref> It is a single-runway airport. Runway 17/35 is a concrete runway that is 6,850' by 100'. It has terminal and fixed based operations, and is owned by the City of Bartlesville. \n\n===Railroad===\n\nBartlesville is served by SKOL Railroad, a shortline railroad of WATCO headquartered in Pittsburg, Kansas. The line comes into Bartlesville from the north, crossing the trestle over the Caney River. It continues southwest to the west of downtown, and exits Bartlesville at the trestle to the south near East 23rd Street. \n\nThis line was the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe until it merged with Burlington Northern to form the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe. The line was to be abandoned, leaving Bartlesville and Washington County without rail service. The line comes into Washington County to the north from the nearby town of Caney, Kansas, then runs through Copan, Dewey, Bartlesville, Ochelata, Ramona, and Vera into Collinsville, Owasso, and Tulsa. The switch to the BNSF Cherokee Subdivision is just west of North Greenwood Avenue in Tulsa. There are no Class 1 Railroads in Bartlesville or Washington County. The line at one time had passenger service, and the depot downtown on SW. Keeler Avenue at 2nd Street was a full-time passenger and freight depot.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe [[Bartlesville Barflies]] Barbershop Quartet were the inaugural champions of [[Barbershop Harmony Society|SPEBSQSA]].\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- people with existing Wikipedia articles, maintain alphabetical order-->\n* [[Boots Adams]], business executive and civic philanthropist of Bartlesville, Oklahoma.\n* [[Bud Adams]], owner of the [[Tennessee Titans]]; enrolled [[Cherokee]], grew up in Bartlesville.\n* [[Nancy Barrett]], actress\n* [[Omar Browning]], basketball player, [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] head coach\n* [[Mark Costello (Oklahoma politician)|Mark Costello]], Oklahoma politician\n* [[Patrick Cranshaw]], actor\n* [[Ree Drummond]], blogger and TV cook\n* [[Lyle Goodhue]], scientist \n* [[Meredith Howard Harless]], performer\n* [[Becky Hobbs]], singer\n* [[Sven Erik Holmes]], United States district judge\n* [[Ted Hsu]], retired Member of Canadian Parliament for the riding of Kingston and the Islands.\n* [[Todd Ames Hunter]], Texas politician, born in Bartlesville in 1953\n* [[Bob Kurland]], basketball player\n* [[Tyson Meade]], rock singer\n* [[Emeka Okafor]], basketball player\n* [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]], founder of Phillips Petroleum\n* [[Kinga Philipps]], actress/producer\n* [[Everett Piper]], former President of [[Oklahoma Wesleyan University]]\n* [[Mark Price]], basketball player\n* [[Tim Pugh]], baseball player\n* [[Allen Rucker]], writer\n* [[William Salyers]], stage, screen and voice actor\n* [[Louis_Skurcenski|Louis Skurcenski]], basketball player\n* [[Greater Tuna|Joe Sears]], actor\n* [[Gretchen Wyler]], actress\n* [[Kathleen Zellner]], attorney\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Oklahoma}}\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Oklahoma]]\n* [[Pathfinder Parkway]] -

He settled first at Silver Lake, a natural lake south of the present city of Bartlesville. In 1874, he opened a trading post and post office on Turkey Creek, in what is now East Bartlesville. In the following year, he bought a grist mill on the [[Caney River]] and modified it to produce flour. Bartles then built a two-story general store and residence, and added a rooming house, a blacksmith shop and a livery stable. Other settlers soon moved into the immediate area, which was then called Bartles Town. In 1880, Bartles moved his Turkey Creek post office to this town. Bartles then provided the community with electricity, a  telephone system and a water distribution system.<ref name = \"EOHC-Bartlesville\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BA026 May, Jon D. \"Bartlesville.\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.] Retrieved January 15, 2012.</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the present city began after William Johnstone and George B.

It follows Washington Boulevard from Minnesota Street as it comes out of the nearby city of [[Dewey, Oklahoma|Dewey]] to the north and Washington County Road W. 2400 to the south. The city limits stretch just to the south of the Walmart Distribution Center on US-75/Washington County Road W. 3000, east of the town of Ochelata. US-75 continues south into [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].\n*[[U.S. Route 60 in Oklahoma|US-60]] is the primary east-west US highway in Bartlesville and Washington County. It follows Nowata Road, east of SE Bison Road on the city's east side to Washington Boulevard (US-75). The highway continues north, where it follows Washington Boulevard (US-75) to the Washington Boulevard/Adams Road interchange. From the Washington Boulevard/Adams Road interchange, US-60 departs US-75 and continues west, where it follows Adams Road to Western Street. From Adams Road, it continues north on Western Street (OK-123) to the Western Street/Frank Phillips Boulevard/Hensley Boulevard intersection, where the highway exits to the west, toward [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma|Pawhuska]]. Western Street rests on the Washington/Osage County Line.\n*[[Oklahoma State Highway 123|SH-123]] follows Bartles Road coming from the west side of Dewey as it crosses the Caney River Bridge just north of Hensley Boulevard. The highway turns west and runs along Hensley Boulevard for approximately {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} to the Hensley Boulevard/Frank Phillips Boulevard/Western Street intersection. The highway runs a brief distance along US-60, departing at Adams Road. SH-123 then departs Bartlesville to the southwest toward [[Barnsdall, Oklahoma|Barnsdall]] in Osage County.\n\n===Airport and aviation===\nBartlesville Municipal Airport sits on the city's west side on US-60 in Osage County.<ref>[https://www.cityofbartlesville.org/city-services/municipal-airport/ Bartlesville Municipal Airport]</ref> It is a single-runway airport. Runway 17/35 is a concrete runway that is 6,850' by 100'. It has terminal and fixed based operations, and is owned by the City of Bartlesville. \n\n===Railroad===\n\nBartlesville is served by SKOL Railroad, a shortline railroad of WATCO headquartered in Pittsburg, Kansas. The line comes into Bartlesville from the north, crossing the trestle over the Caney River. It continues southwest to the west of downtown, and exits Bartlesville at the trestle to the south near East 23rd Street. \n\nThis line was the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe until it merged with Burlington Northern to form the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe. The line was to be abandoned, leaving Bartlesville and Washington County without rail service. The line comes into Washington County to the north from the nearby town of Caney, Kansas, then runs through Copan, Dewey, Bartlesville, Ochelata, Ramona, and Vera into Collinsville, Owasso, and Tulsa. The switch to the BNSF Cherokee Subdivision is just west of North Greenwood Avenue in Tulsa. There are no Class 1 Railroads in Bartlesville or Washington County. The line at one time had passenger service, and the depot downtown on SW.

The church is still used today.\n\nIn 1889 a [[Point Barrow Refuge Station|whaling supply and rescue station]] was built. It is the oldest wood-frame building in Utqia\u0121vik and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The rescue station was converted for use in 1896 as the retail Cape Smythe Whaling and Trading Station.

They wrote a constitution and by-laws, under the provisions of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.\n\nUtqia\u0121vik was incorporated as a 1st Class City under the name Barrow in 1958.\n\nResidents of the North Slope were the only Native people to vote on acceptance of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]; they rejected it. The Act was passed in December 1971 and, despite their opposition, became law. The [[Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation]] (UIC) is the for-profit village corporation established under the Act.\n\nIn 1972, the [[North Slope Borough]] was established. With millions of dollars in new revenues from the settlement and later oil revenues, the borough has created sanitation facilities, water and electrical utilities, roads, fire departments, and health and educational services in Utqia\u0121vik and the villages of the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]].\n\nIn 1986, the North Slope Borough created the North Slope Higher Education Center.

The church is still used today.\n\nIn 1889 a [[Point Barrow Refuge Station|whaling supply and rescue station]] was built. It is the oldest wood-frame building in Utqia\u0121vik and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The rescue station was converted for use in 1896 as the retail Cape Smythe Whaling and Trading Station.

They wrote a constitution and by-laws, under the provisions of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.\n\nUtqia\u0121vik was incorporated as a 1st Class City under the name Barrow in 1958.\n\nResidents of the North Slope were the only Native people to vote on acceptance of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]; they rejected it. The Act was passed in December 1971 and, despite their opposition, became law. The [[Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation]] (UIC) is the for-profit village corporation established under the Act.\n\nIn 1972, the [[North Slope Borough]] was established. With millions of dollars in new revenues from the settlement and later oil revenues, the borough has created sanitation facilities, water and electrical utilities, roads, fire departments, and health and educational services in Utqia\u0121vik and the villages of the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]].\n\nIn 1986, the North Slope Borough created the North Slope Higher Education Center.
