He further asserted that the poem referred to European immigrants, though these assertions were disputed by Lazarus's biographer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Immigration Chief: 'Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor Who Can Stand On Their Own 2 Feet' |date=August 13, 2019 |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |first=Sasha |last=Ingber |agency=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750726795/immigration-chief-give-me-your-tired-your-poor-who-can-stand-on-their-own-2-feet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Who can stand on their own two feet': Ken Cuccinelli edits famous Statue of Liberty poem |first=Colby |last=Itkowitz |date=August 13, 2019 |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/who-can-stand-on-their-own-two-feet-ken-cuccinelli-edits-famous-statue-of-liberty-poem/2019/08/13/4cdddf62-bdcc-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Trump official: Statue of Liberty poem should mean 'poor who can stand on own two feet' |first=Edward |last=Helmore |date=August 13, 2019 |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/13/statue-of-liberty-poem-trump-official-immigration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=August 13, 2019 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/13/ken-cuccinelli-statue-liberty-poem-refers-migrants-europe/2004455001/|title=Immigration official Ken Cuccinelli: Statue of Liberty poem refers to immigrants from Europe|last=Morin|first=Rebecca|newspaper=USA Today|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, Ken Cuccinelli testified to a Congressional investigation that he alone had made the decision to end the medical deferred action program, a decision which he reversed after public outcry, and complaints from some patients in the U.S. for medical care that they would die if deported to their home countries.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dooling |first=Shannon |date=October 30, 2019 |url=https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/10/30/uscis-ice-cuccinelli-medical-deferred-action-immigration |title='I Made This Decision, Alone'; Months Later, Clarity Around The End Of Medical Deferred Action |publisher=WBUR |language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 2020, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] ruled that Cuccinelli's appointment as USCIS director was illegal because the newly created principal deputy director role did not count as a \"first assistant\" under the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]] because he had never served in a subordinate role to any other USCIS official.

He was also the first Attorney-General of [[Alberta]]. Born in [[Ontario]], he studied law at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] before coming west to practice in [[Edmonton]]. He became active with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and when Alberta was created in 1905 he was chosen by Premier [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] to be its first Attorney-General. Implicated in the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], he resigned in 1910 along with the rest of Rutherford's government.\n\nAs a [[backbencher]], he became the leader of Liberals opposed to the government of Rutherford's successor, [[Arthur Sifton]], until Sifton re-appointed him Attorney-General in 1912. Cross served in this capacity under Sifton and his successor [[Charles Stewart (premier)|Charles Stewart]] until 1918, when Stewart fired him after receiving no response to his request for Cross's resignation. Cross remained in provincial politics until 1925, but in a radically diminished role. After leaving provincial politics, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, only to be defeated in his 1926 re-election bid. He died in 1928.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nCross was born in [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]], [[Ontario]] to merchant Thomas Cross and his wife, Marie Mouncey. He studied at [[Upper Canada College]], the [[University of Toronto]], and [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]. He moved west to [[Edmonton]] in 1897,<ref name=\"DCB\">{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cross_charles_wilson_15E.html| last=Finkel| first=Alvin| title=Cross, Charles Wilson|volume=15}}</ref> where he opened a law practice with [[William Short (Alberta politician)|William Short]]; it exists today as Duncan Craig LLP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duncanandcraig.com/ |title=Duncan & Craig LLP |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}</ref> When the idea of creating one or more new provinces out of the [[Northwest Territories]] gained currency, Cross was one of three people selected by [[Edmonton City Council]] to travel to [[Ottawa]] and ensure that Edmonton's interests were respected.<ref name=\"DCB\" />\n\n== Provincial politics ==\n\n=== Early provincial career ===\n\nCross was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and fast established himself was one of the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], the owner of the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' and local Member of Parliament.<ref name=\"DCB\" /><ref name=\"Thomas 21\">Thomas 21</ref> Once the decision was made to create the province of [[Alberta]], the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier [[Frederick W. A. G. Haultain]], who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]], were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first [[Premier of Alberta]], either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a [[coalition government|coalition]] of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.<ref>Thomas 15</ref>\n\nCross's view prevailed, and Alberta's first [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], Liberal [[George Bulyea]], invited [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] to form a government. Haultain went to [[Saskatchewan]], created from a portion of the Northwest Territories at the same time as Alberta was, to lead the [[Provincial Rights Party]].<ref>Thomas 18\u201320</ref> Though Cross was only 32, Rutherford named him Alberta's first Attorney-General.<ref name=\"Thomas 21\" />  In consequence, he was required to contest the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 election]]. He did so in the district of [[Edmonton (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton]], against [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[William Antrobus Griesbach]]. Griesbach fought his campaign on the Liberal federal government's imposition on Alberta of a requirement to fund [[separate schools]], an imposition to which older provinces were not subject.<ref>Thomas 24</ref> Cross won the election with such a margin that Griesbach lost his [[deposit (politics)|deposit]].<ref>Thomas 28</ref>\n\nOne of the first questions considered by the new [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, but there was a movement to make [[Calgary]] the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works [[William Henry Cushing]], Cross's cabinet colleague, who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the [[North American fur trade|Canadian fur trade]] and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8.<ref>Thomas 38</ref> It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.\n\nAs Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for overseeing prosecutions. He was especially aggressive in his enforcement of the ''Sabbath Observance Act'', which prohibited most business activities on Sundays.<ref>Thomas 68</ref> He also introduced new [[workers' compensation]] legislation, the highlight of which was making compensation automatic, rather than the result of a lawsuit by the injured worker.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> Though the bill addressed some of the labour movement's concerns,<ref name=\"DCB\" /> there remained many criticisms: it failed to fine employers responsible for workplace hazards, did not apply to injuries sustained while building or repairing buildings of less than {{convert|40|ft|m}} in height, did not protect casual labourers, and limited compensation to a maximum of [[C$]]1,500. In response to these concerns, Cross lowered the minimum building height to {{convert|30|ft|m}} and raised the maximum compensation to $1,800. To assuage farm leaders, he also included an exemption for farm labour.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\" />\n\n=== Railway scandal ===\n{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}\n\nCross was re-elected in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]] as one of two members elected in the newly expanded Edmonton district.<ref name=\"1909 results\" />  Soon after, in February 1910, Cushing resigned from cabinet, stating that he disagreed with Rutherford's approach to railway policy and specifically with his actions regarding the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway]] (A&GW). The A&GW was one of several new railways to take advantage of the government's offer, made under considerable public pressure, of [[loan guarantee]]s. Cushing and [[John R. Boyle]] attacked Rutherford's government, with the latter charging that the Deputy Attorney-General, S. B. Woods, had removed papers from the government's files on the A&GW. Cross denied these charges on his deputy's behalf.<ref>Thomas 72</ref> Boyle followed with a motion that the assets of the A&GW, which he believed was taking advantage of the government's guarantees to build a sub-standard railway at government expense, be [[Nationalization|expropriated]].<ref>Thomas 74</ref> Cross led the government's opposition to the motion.<ref>Thomas 75</ref>\n\nOn March 9, Cross abruptly resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford had told him that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: he said that he had been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier had told him that if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General.<ref>Thomas 82\u201383</ref> Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.<ref>Thomas 85</ref>\n\nThe crisis divided the Liberal Party into two camps: the pro-government Liberals, led by Cross and Rutherford, and the insurgent Liberals, led by Cushing and Boyle. The insurgents' objective was to replace Rutherford with Cushing. Though most important Liberals outside the legislature, including Bulyea and Oliver, lacked confidence in Rutherford, they had little more in Cushing.<ref>Thomas 87</ref> Some newspapers characterized the struggle as the visible element of a battle for influence between Oliver, long Alberta's most prominent Liberal, and Cross, seen as its rising star.<ref name=\"Thomas 91\">Thomas 91</ref> Though Rutherford never actually lost a [[confidence motion]], Bulyea pressured him to resign in favour of [[Arthur Sifton]], the province's chief justice. Several of Cross's supporters attempted to extract a promise to keep Cross as Attorney-General in exchange for their support of Sifton's government, but Sifton was unwilling to agree. Rutherford eventually and reluctantly complied with Bulyea's wishes, and the rest of his government, including Cross, followed suit.<ref>Thomas 89\u201390</ref> Subsequent rumours suggested that Cross and his followers had agreed to resign only because of a belief that Sifton would be appointed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] after approximately a year as Premier, with Cross then being asked to form a government.<ref name=\"Thomas 92\">Thomas 92</ref> A subsequent commission declined to find Cross guilty of wrongdoing in relation to the A&GW incident, but criticized him and Rutherford for granting over-generous terms to the railway.<ref>Thomas 104</ref>\n\n=== Backbenches and return to cabinet ===\n\nIn keeping with Sifton's policy of excluding all prominent players in the A&GW affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out).<ref name=\"Thomas 91\" /> Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's.<ref name=\"Thomas 92\" /> In response to the A&GW's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A&GW had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A&GW and concerned that the bill did not include a commitment to use the money to do so, opposed it.<ref>Thomas 110</ref> The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction.<ref>Thomas 121</ref> At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A&GW affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]]. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy \"made it proper for me to support and join his government\".<ref>Thomas 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nIn keeping with custom at the time, once appointed to cabinet Cross resigned his seat in the legislature and contested it in a by-election. His by-election was held at the same time as four others, and while Liberal papers were unhesitant about endorsing the Liberal candidates in those, in Edmonton they gave Cross a somewhat bumpier ride. The ''Calgary Albertan'', in an editorial advocating the return of Liberal candidates in all five by-elections, criticized Cross as \"disloyal to [Sifton] in the beginning, and doubtless will be to the end.\" The ''Edmonton Bulletin'', still owned by Oliver, complained that while in the other four by-elections voters were being asked to judge Sifton's government, in Edmonton it appeared that they were being asked to judge Rutherford's.<ref>Thomas 126</ref> Cross defeated his main opponent, Conservative [[Albert Ewing]], but by a much smaller margin than he had managed in 1905 and 1909.<ref name=\"Results 1912\" /> Ewing claimed electoral fraud and appealed the outcome to the courts, but the 1913 election pre-empted his appeal.<ref>Thomas 127</ref> In that election, perhaps recalling the narrowness of his by-election win, Cross ran in two ridings, Edmonton and [[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]]. He won both (Ewing was the second victor from the two-member Edmonton district), making him the only person in Alberta history to represent two constituencies at the same time (though not the only one to try: Sifton also did so in 1913, and Boyle would in 1921).<ref>Thomas 144</ref>\n\n[[Prohibition in Canada|Prohibition]] was gaining currency in Alberta: the Conservatives had included it in their 1913 platform, and it was supported by the increasingly powerful [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA).<ref>Thomas 136, 138\u2013139</ref> The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up [[Manitoba]] as example of its failures.<ref>Thomas 139</ref> But the government had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced [[direct democracy]] measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate [[plebiscite]]s. The well-organized [[temperance movement]] did so on prohibition, which was endorsed in the [[1916 Alberta prohibition plebiscite|ensuing plebiscite]]; the legislature passed the ''Prohibition Act'' in the spring of 1916.<ref>Thomas 157\u2013160</ref> As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.<ref>Thomas 161</ref>\n\n=== Conscription and the Stewart cabinet ===\n\nIn 1917, the Alberta Liberal Party, held delicately together since 1910, burst once again into conflict with the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription crisis]]. The Conservative federal government of [[Robert Borden]] supported imposing [[conscription]] to help win [[World War I]], and most of [[English Canada]] supported him. The Liberal leader, [[Wilfrid Laurier]], opposed conscription, but many of the party's English-speaking members supported it and defected to a Borden-led [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union government]]. This dispute had repercussions in the Alberta party: Sifton supported conscription, and shortly after winning the [[1917 Alberta general election|1917 election]] (in which Cross was re-elected in Edson but did not run in Edmonton) resigned as Premier to move to federal politics and a ministry in Borden's government.<ref>Thomas 179</ref> Cross opposed conscription. In this he was joined by Oliver, and the two put aside years of animosity to campaign together for Laurier in the [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 federal election]]. Cross regarded Laurier as something of a hero, and proclaimed that he was \"fairly convinced that the first duty of Canadians to their country is to get rid of the crowd of profiteers at Ottawa who have brought the country to its present condition.\"<ref>Thomas 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nSifton's successor as Premier was [[Charles Stewart (premier)|Charles Stewart]], the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet. Stewart, who supported conscription but did not actively campaign for it or the Unionists, kept Cross as Attorney-General, despite rumours that he would not.<ref>Thomas 180\u2013181</ref> Cross's major challenge was enforcing prohibition, which was proving challenging. The Conservatives, and in particular [[George Douglas Stanley]], were unreluctant to accuse Cross of mismanagement.<ref>Thomas 168</ref> In the meantime, a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart (whom the Conservatives accused, somewhat ironically, of being unduly influenced by his Attorney-General). Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties, and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the [[Alberta Provincial Police]], Stewart requested his resignation. When twelve days passed without a reply from Cross, Stewart fired him August 26, 1918. His replacement as Attorney-General was Boyle, his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era.<ref name=\"Thomas 194\">Thomas 194</ref>\n\nCross remained in the legislature for several more years, but took no active role in its proceedings, and soon ceased to be regarded as a major force.<ref name=\"Thomas 194\" />  He was re-elected in the [[1921 Alberta general election|1921 election]], making him and Boyle the only veterans of the first legislature still in office. The UFA, fielding candidates for the first time, won a majority of seats in the election, and Stewart resigned as Premier.<ref>Thomas 204</ref> Cross continued his indifferent performance as MLA until May 1925, when he resigned to enter federal politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=28f68fcb-ba1b-4bb2-8f3b-89b7d48a8f07&Language=E&Section=ALL |title=Parliamentarian file \u2013 Complete file \u2013 Cross, Charles Wilson |publisher=Parliament of Canada |accessdate=October 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Federal career and later life ==\n\nCross ran as a Liberal in the [[1925 Canadian federal election|1925 federal election]] in the riding of [[Athabaska (electoral district)|Athabaska]], and defeated [[Donald Ferdinand Kellner]], the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] incumbent from [[Edmonton East]]. Stewart, who had also left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent [[Edmonton West]]. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross sat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] throughout the [[King-Byng Affair]]. In the ensuing [[1926 Canadian federal election|1926 election]], Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner. Charles Wilson Cross died of a heart attack June 2, 1928, in Calgary.<ref name=\"DCB\" />\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n{{Canadian federal election, 1926/Athabaska}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 1925/Athabaska}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=center|'''[[1921 Alberta general election]] results ([[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]])'''<ref name=\"results 1921\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/administration/maps_choice.php?Year=1921&Constit=Edson |title=Election results for Edson, 1921 |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"|<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">'''Turnout N.A.'''</span>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | '''Affiliation'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Candidate'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Votes'''\n| valign=\"top\" align=\"right\"|'''%'''\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Liberal/row}}\n|[[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]]\n|Charles Wilson Cross\n|align=\"right\"|1,321\n|align=\"right\"|57.94%\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Labour/row}}\n|[[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Labour]]\n|John Diamond\n|align=\"right\"|959\n|align=\"right\"|42.06%\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=center|'''[[1917 Alberta general election]] results ([[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]])'''<ref name=\"results 1917\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/administration/maps_choice.php?Year=1917&Constit=Edson |title=Election results for Edson, 1917 |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"|<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">'''Turnout N.A.'''</span>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | '''Affiliation'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Candidate'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Votes'''\n| valign=\"top\" align=\"right\"|'''%'''\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Liberal/row}}\n|[[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]]\n|Charles Wilson Cross\n|align=\"right\"|1,116\n|align=\"right\"|62.91%\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Progressive Conservatives/row}}\n|[[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]]\n|J.

He was also the first Attorney-General of [[Alberta]]. Born in [[Ontario]], he studied law at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] before coming west to practice in [[Edmonton]]. He became active with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and when Alberta was created in 1905 he was chosen by Premier [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] to be its first Attorney-General. Implicated in the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], he resigned in 1910 along with the rest of Rutherford's government.\n\nAs a [[backbencher]], he became the leader of Liberals opposed to the government of Rutherford's successor, [[Arthur Sifton]], until Sifton re-appointed him Attorney-General in 1912. Cross served in this capacity under Sifton and his successor [[Charles Stewart (premier)|Charles Stewart]] until 1918, when Stewart fired him after receiving no response to his request for Cross's resignation. Cross remained in provincial politics until 1925, but in a radically diminished role. After leaving provincial politics, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, only to be defeated in his 1926 re-election bid. He died in 1928.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nCross was born in [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]], [[Ontario]] to merchant Thomas Cross and his wife, Marie Mouncey. He studied at [[Upper Canada College]], the [[University of Toronto]], and [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]. He moved west to [[Edmonton]] in 1897,<ref name=\"DCB\">{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cross_charles_wilson_15E.html| last=Finkel| first=Alvin| title=Cross, Charles Wilson|volume=15}}</ref> where he opened a law practice with [[William Short (Alberta politician)|William Short]]; it exists today as Duncan Craig LLP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duncanandcraig.com/ |title=Duncan & Craig LLP |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}</ref> When the idea of creating one or more new provinces out of the [[Northwest Territories]] gained currency, Cross was one of three people selected by [[Edmonton City Council]] to travel to [[Ottawa]] and ensure that Edmonton's interests were respected.<ref name=\"DCB\" />\n\n== Provincial politics ==\n\n=== Early provincial career ===\n\nCross was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and fast established himself was one of the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], the owner of the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' and local Member of Parliament.<ref name=\"DCB\" /><ref name=\"Thomas 21\">Thomas 21</ref> Once the decision was made to create the province of [[Alberta]], the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier [[Frederick W. A. G. Haultain]], who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]], were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first [[Premier of Alberta]], either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a [[coalition government|coalition]] of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.<ref>Thomas 15</ref>\n\nCross's view prevailed, and Alberta's first [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], Liberal [[George Bulyea]], invited [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] to form a government. Haultain went to [[Saskatchewan]], created from a portion of the Northwest Territories at the same time as Alberta was, to lead the [[Provincial Rights Party]].<ref>Thomas 18\u201320</ref> Though Cross was only 32, Rutherford named him Alberta's first Attorney-General.<ref name=\"Thomas 21\" />  In consequence, he was required to contest the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 election]]. He did so in the district of [[Edmonton (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton]], against [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[William Antrobus Griesbach]]. Griesbach fought his campaign on the Liberal federal government's imposition on Alberta of a requirement to fund [[separate schools]], an imposition to which older provinces were not subject.<ref>Thomas 24</ref> Cross won the election with such a margin that Griesbach lost his [[deposit (politics)|deposit]].<ref>Thomas 28</ref>\n\nOne of the first questions considered by the new [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, but there was a movement to make [[Calgary]] the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works [[William Henry Cushing]], Cross's cabinet colleague, who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the [[North American fur trade|Canadian fur trade]] and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8.<ref>Thomas 38</ref> It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.\n\nAs Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for overseeing prosecutions. He was especially aggressive in his enforcement of the ''Sabbath Observance Act'', which prohibited most business activities on Sundays.<ref>Thomas 68</ref> He also introduced new [[workers' compensation]] legislation, the highlight of which was making compensation automatic, rather than the result of a lawsuit by the injured worker.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> Though the bill addressed some of the labour movement's concerns,<ref name=\"DCB\" /> there remained many criticisms: it failed to fine employers responsible for workplace hazards, did not apply to injuries sustained while building or repairing buildings of less than {{convert|40|ft|m}} in height, did not protect casual labourers, and limited compensation to a maximum of [[C$]]1,500. In response to these concerns, Cross lowered the minimum building height to {{convert|30|ft|m}} and raised the maximum compensation to $1,800. To assuage farm leaders, he also included an exemption for farm labour.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\" />\n\n=== Railway scandal ===\n{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}\n\nCross was re-elected in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]] as one of two members elected in the newly expanded Edmonton district.<ref name=\"1909 results\" />  Soon after, in February 1910, Cushing resigned from cabinet, stating that he disagreed with Rutherford's approach to railway policy and specifically with his actions regarding the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway]] (A&GW). The A&GW was one of several new railways to take advantage of the government's offer, made under considerable public pressure, of [[loan guarantee]]s. Cushing and [[John R. Boyle]] attacked Rutherford's government, with the latter charging that the Deputy Attorney-General, S. B. Woods, had removed papers from the government's files on the A&GW. Cross denied these charges on his deputy's behalf.<ref>Thomas 72</ref> Boyle followed with a motion that the assets of the A&GW, which he believed was taking advantage of the government's guarantees to build a sub-standard railway at government expense, be [[Nationalization|expropriated]].<ref>Thomas 74</ref> Cross led the government's opposition to the motion.<ref>Thomas 75</ref>\n\nOn March 9, Cross abruptly resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford had told him that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: he said that he had been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier had told him that if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General.<ref>Thomas 82\u201383</ref> Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.<ref>Thomas 85</ref>\n\nThe crisis divided the Liberal Party into two camps: the pro-government Liberals, led by Cross and Rutherford, and the insurgent Liberals, led by Cushing and Boyle. The insurgents' objective was to replace Rutherford with Cushing. Though most important Liberals outside the legislature, including Bulyea and Oliver, lacked confidence in Rutherford, they had little more in Cushing.<ref>Thomas 87</ref> Some newspapers characterized the struggle as the visible element of a battle for influence between Oliver, long Alberta's most prominent Liberal, and Cross, seen as its rising star.<ref name=\"Thomas 91\">Thomas 91</ref> Though Rutherford never actually lost a [[confidence motion]], Bulyea pressured him to resign in favour of [[Arthur Sifton]], the province's chief justice. Several of Cross's supporters attempted to extract a promise to keep Cross as Attorney-General in exchange for their support of Sifton's government, but Sifton was unwilling to agree. Rutherford eventually and reluctantly complied with Bulyea's wishes, and the rest of his government, including Cross, followed suit.<ref>Thomas 89\u201390</ref> Subsequent rumours suggested that Cross and his followers had agreed to resign only because of a belief that Sifton would be appointed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] after approximately a year as Premier, with Cross then being asked to form a government.<ref name=\"Thomas 92\">Thomas 92</ref> A subsequent commission declined to find Cross guilty of wrongdoing in relation to the A&GW incident, but criticized him and Rutherford for granting over-generous terms to the railway.<ref>Thomas 104</ref>\n\n=== Backbenches and return to cabinet ===\n\nIn keeping with Sifton's policy of excluding all prominent players in the A&GW affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out).<ref name=\"Thomas 91\" /> Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's.<ref name=\"Thomas 92\" /> In response to the A&GW's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A&GW had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A&GW and concerned that the bill did not include a commitment to use the money to do so, opposed it.<ref>Thomas 110</ref> The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction.<ref>Thomas 121</ref> At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A&GW affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]]. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy \"made it proper for me to support and join his government\".<ref>Thomas 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nIn keeping with custom at the time, once appointed to cabinet Cross resigned his seat in the legislature and contested it in a by-election. His by-election was held at the same time as four others, and while Liberal papers were unhesitant about endorsing the Liberal candidates in those, in Edmonton they gave Cross a somewhat bumpier ride. The ''Calgary Albertan'', in an editorial advocating the return of Liberal candidates in all five by-elections, criticized Cross as \"disloyal to [Sifton] in the beginning, and doubtless will be to the end.\" The ''Edmonton Bulletin'', still owned by Oliver, complained that while in the other four by-elections voters were being asked to judge Sifton's government, in Edmonton it appeared that they were being asked to judge Rutherford's.<ref>Thomas 126</ref> Cross defeated his main opponent, Conservative [[Albert Ewing]], but by a much smaller margin than he had managed in 1905 and 1909.<ref name=\"Results 1912\" /> Ewing claimed electoral fraud and appealed the outcome to the courts, but the 1913 election pre-empted his appeal.<ref>Thomas 127</ref> In that election, perhaps recalling the narrowness of his by-election win, Cross ran in two ridings, Edmonton and [[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]]. He won both (Ewing was the second victor from the two-member Edmonton district), making him the only person in Alberta history to represent two constituencies at the same time (though not the only one to try: Sifton also did so in 1913, and Boyle would in 1921).<ref>Thomas 144</ref>\n\n[[Prohibition in Canada|Prohibition]] was gaining currency in Alberta: the Conservatives had included it in their 1913 platform, and it was supported by the increasingly powerful [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA).<ref>Thomas 136, 138\u2013139</ref> The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up [[Manitoba]] as example of its failures.<ref>Thomas 139</ref> But the government had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced [[direct democracy]] measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate [[plebiscite]]s. The well-organized [[temperance movement]] did so on prohibition, which was endorsed in the [[1916 Alberta prohibition plebiscite|ensuing plebiscite]]; the legislature passed the ''Prohibition Act'' in the spring of 1916.<ref>Thomas 157\u2013160</ref> As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.<ref>Thomas 161</ref>\n\n=== Conscription and the Stewart cabinet ===\n\nIn 1917, the Alberta Liberal Party, held delicately together since 1910, burst once again into conflict with the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription crisis]]. The Conservative federal government of [[Robert Borden]] supported imposing [[conscription]] to help win [[World War I]], and most of [[English Canada]] supported him. The Liberal leader, [[Wilfrid Laurier]], opposed conscription, but many of the party's English-speaking members supported it and defected to a Borden-led [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union government]]. This dispute had repercussions in the Alberta party: Sifton supported conscription, and shortly after winning the [[1917 Alberta general election|1917 election]] (in which Cross was re-elected in Edson but did not run in Edmonton) resigned as Premier to move to federal politics and a ministry in Borden's government.<ref>Thomas 179</ref> Cross opposed conscription. In this he was joined by Oliver, and the two put aside years of animosity to campaign together for Laurier in the [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 federal election]]. Cross regarded Laurier as something of a hero, and proclaimed that he was \"fairly convinced that the first duty of Canadians to their country is to get rid of the crowd of profiteers at Ottawa who have brought the country to its present condition.\"<ref>Thomas 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nSifton's successor as Premier was [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]], the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet. Stewart, who supported conscription but did not actively campaign for it or the Unionists, kept Cross as Attorney-General, despite rumours that he would not.<ref>Thomas 180\u2013181</ref> Cross's major challenge was enforcing prohibition, which was proving challenging. The Conservatives, and in particular [[George Douglas Stanley]], were unreluctant to accuse Cross of mismanagement.<ref>Thomas 168</ref> In the meantime, a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart (whom the Conservatives accused, somewhat ironically, of being unduly influenced by his Attorney-General). Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties, and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the [[Alberta Provincial Police]], Stewart requested his resignation. When twelve days passed without a reply from Cross, Stewart fired him August 26, 1918. His replacement as Attorney-General was Boyle, his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era.<ref name=\"Thomas 194\">Thomas 194</ref>\n\nCross remained in the legislature for several more years, but took no active role in its proceedings, and soon ceased to be regarded as a major force.<ref name=\"Thomas 194\" />  He was re-elected in the [[1921 Alberta general election|1921 election]], making him and Boyle the only veterans of the first legislature still in office. The UFA, fielding candidates for the first time, won a majority of seats in the election, and Stewart resigned as Premier.<ref>Thomas 204</ref> Cross continued his indifferent performance as MLA until May 1925, when he resigned to enter federal politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=28f68fcb-ba1b-4bb2-8f3b-89b7d48a8f07&Language=E&Section=ALL |title=Parliamentarian file \u2013 Complete file \u2013 Cross, Charles Wilson |publisher=Parliament of Canada |accessdate=October 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Federal career and later life ==\n\nCross ran as a Liberal in the [[1925 Canadian federal election|1925 federal election]] in the riding of [[Athabaska (electoral district)|Athabaska]], and defeated [[Donald Ferdinand Kellner]], the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] incumbent from [[Edmonton East]]. Stewart, who had also left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent [[Edmonton West]]. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross sat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] throughout the [[King-Byng Affair]]. In the ensuing [[1926 Canadian federal election|1926 election]], Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner. Charles Wilson Cross died of a heart attack June 2, 1928, in Calgary.<ref name=\"DCB\" />\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n{{Canadian federal election, 1926/Athabaska}}\n{{Canadian federal election, 1925/Athabaska}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=center|'''[[1921 Alberta general election]] results ([[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]])'''<ref name=\"results 1921\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/administration/maps_choice.php?Year=1921&Constit=Edson |title=Election results for Edson, 1921 |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"|<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">'''Turnout N.A.'''</span>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | '''Affiliation'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Candidate'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Votes'''\n| valign=\"top\" align=\"right\"|'''%'''\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Liberal/row}}\n|[[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]]\n|Charles Wilson Cross\n|align=\"right\"|1,321\n|align=\"right\"|57.94%\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Labour/row}}\n|[[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Labour]]\n|John Diamond\n|align=\"right\"|959\n|align=\"right\"|42.06%\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=center|'''[[1917 Alberta general election]] results ([[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]])'''<ref name=\"results 1917\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/administration/maps_choice.php?Year=1917&Constit=Edson |title=Election results for Edson, 1917 |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"|<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">'''Turnout N.A.'''</span>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | '''Affiliation'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Candidate'''\n| valign=\"top\" |'''Votes'''\n| valign=\"top\" align=\"right\"|'''%'''\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Liberal/row}}\n|[[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]]\n|Charles Wilson Cross\n|align=\"right\"|1,116\n|align=\"right\"|62.91%\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Progressive Conservatives/row}}\n|[[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]]\n|J.

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewardsfor captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref>\n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use. Prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded was for the capture of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482\u2013485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger 522\u2013524\">Rodger 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders.

A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76.

Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. From 1861, US Navy ships engaged [[Confederate privateer]]s and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]], it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewardsfor captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref>\n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use. Prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder.

The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger 522\u2013524\">Rodger 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned. Most of these engaged in Atlantic trade had to sail around the north of Scotland to avoid the English Channel in wartime, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers, who were particularly successful in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.<ref name = \"Graham, 69-70\"> Graham 69-70</ref> The owners of privateering vessels, were entitled to the greater part of the value of their prizes, as their ordinary seamen usually served for wages rather than a share of prize money.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 177\"> Murdoch 177</ref> \n\n===Ireland===\nAdmirals of Ireland were appointed in the later middle ages and from the late 16th century, these admirals became the Irish representatives of the Lord Admiral of England, and were sometimes referred to as the Vice-Admiral of Ireland, but had no control over the royal fleet in Irish waters. Ireland also had its own Admiralty Court, mainly staffed by English admiralty officials and with a jurisdiction was broadly similar to that of its English counterpart.<ref name = \"Appleby & O'Dowd, 229-300\"> Appleby & O'Dowd 229-300</ref> Much of its activities concerned the many pirates operating off the coast of Ireland during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76. The Prize Council only functioned in times of war until 1861: it then became permanent until its dissolution in 1965.<ref>Archives du Conseil des Prises 1854 to 1965//https://francearchives.fr/fr/findingaid/f0164f7014d16d2cb68bc56607a6700eebf6c874</ref>\n\nAlthough officers and men of the French Navy were, in principle, entitled to prize money, and depriving men of prize money due to them was an established disciplinary measure, awards were relatively rare.<ref name = \"Cormack, 27\"> Cormack 27</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries, French naval strategy alternated between that of ''Guerre d\u2019Escadre'', maintaining a fully-equipped battle fleet for control of the sea, and ''Guerre de Course'', sometimes using naval ships but more often privateers, including smaller naval warships leased to private individuals, to destroy an enemy\u2019s maritime commerce. Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. From 1861, US Navy ships engaged [[Confederate privateer]]s and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]], it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

She was born and raised in [[Lucknow]]. She always aspired to pursue a career in singing, but she married businessman Raj Chandok in 1997 and moved to London, where she gave birth to three children. After getting a divorce from Raj in 2012, she relocated to [[Mumbai]] to become a singer. Kapoor's first song \"[[Alif Allah (Jugni)|Jugni Ji]]\" (2012) was for a music video{{ndash}}which became a commercial success. In 2014, she began her Bollywood playback singing career with the song \"[[Baby Doll (Kanika Kapoor song)|Baby Doll]]\" for the film ''[[Ragini MMS 2]]''. Upon its release, \"Baby Doll\" went viral and topped the charts and Kapoor received wide critical acclaim and several accolades for her singing style, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer]].\n\nKapoor subsequently earned widespread recognition and success for singing one of the Hindi cinema's top charted songs, including \"Lovely\" and \"Kamlee\" for the film ''[[Happy New Year (2014 film)|Happy New Year]]'' (2014), \"[[Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan]]\" for the film  ''[[Roy (film)|Roy]]'' (2015),  \"Desi Look\" for the film ''[[Ek Paheli Leela]]'' (2015), \"Nachan Farrate\" for the film ''[[All Is Well (2015 film)|All Is Well]]'' (2015), \"Jugni Peeke Tight Hai\" for the film ''[[Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon]]'' (2015), \"Jab Chaye Tera Jadoo\" for the film ''[[Main Aur Charles]]'' (2015), \"Neendein Khul Jaati Hain\" for the film ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"premika\" for the film ''[[Dilwale (2015 film)|Dilwale]]'' (2015), the later of these rank among one of the [[List of Bollywood highest-grossing films in overseas markets|highest-grossing Bollywood film]]. The song \"Da Da Dasse\" from the film ''[[Udta Punjab]]'' (2016), earned her several Best Playback Singer awards and nominations{{mdash}}following which she sang the songs, \"Hug Me\" from ''[[Beiimaan Love]]'' (2016), \"Luv Letter\" from the film ''[[The Legend of Michael Mishra]]'' (2016) and \"Beat Pe Booty\" from the film ''[[A Flying Jatt]]'' (2016), all of which earned her further success.\n\nIn March 2020 after returning from London, she attended few parties with Indian politicians and VIPs at Hotel Taj, Lucknow, against Government of India \u2013 Ministry of Health's home quarantine advisory against Coronavirus at the time. Subsequently, she was tested positive<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kanika-kapoor-tests-positive-3rd-time-friend-is-negative/articleshow/74804161.cms|title=Kanika Kapoor tests positive 3rd time, friend is negative &#124; India News|website=The Times of India}}</ref> for Covid-19.

Annual electricity generation in 2015 was 87&nbsp;TWh, which is 20 times more than the Hoover Dam.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-08 | url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2006/06/china-three-gorges-dam-how-big/ | title=China's Three Gorges Dam, by the Numbers | date=2006-06-09 | website=Science}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher=hb.xinhuanet.com | date=December 4, 2008 | access-date=December 6, 2008 | language=Chinese | archivedate=December 7, 2008 | script-title=zh:\u4e09\u5ce1\u673a\u7ec4\u56fd\u4ea7\u5316\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f | url=http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhibo/2008-12/04/content_15097047.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207035144/http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhibo/2008-12/04/content_15097047.htm | df=mdy-all | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Generators ===\nThe main generators weigh about 6,000&nbsp;tonnes each and are designed to produce more than 700&nbsp;MW of power. The designed [[Hydraulic head|head]] of the generator is {{convert|80.6|m|ft|sp=us}}. The flow rate varies between {{convert|600|-|950|m3/s|ft3/s}}  depending on the head available. The greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses [[Francis turbine]]s. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4&nbsp;m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75&nbsp;revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0[[Hertz|Hz]], the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 [[Volt ampere|MVA]], with a maximum of 840&nbsp;MVA and a [[power factor]] of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20&nbsp;[[Volt|kV]]. The electricity generated is then stepped-up to 500 [[Kilovolt|kV]] for transmission at 50&nbsp;Hz. The outer diameter of the generator [[stator]] is 21.4/20.9&nbsp;m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8&nbsp;m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3&nbsp;m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, and reaches 96.5%.<ref>{{cite news | date=August 28, 2008 | agency=Xinhua News Agency | access-date=December 6, 2008 | language=Chinese | archivedate=December 7, 2008 | script-title=zh:\u674e\u6c38\u5b89:\u6211\u6c34\u8f6e\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\u5df2\u5177\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5236\u9020\u80fd\u529b_\u8d22\u7ecf\u9891\u9053_\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2008-08/28/content_9723523_2.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207040501/http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2008-08/28/content_9723523_2.htm | df=mdy-all | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | archive-date=March 7, 2012 | first1=Matthew | last1=Morioka | url=http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/~panos/444_09_4_9.pdf | title=THREE GORGES DAM | access-date=February 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307101739/http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/~panos/444_09_4_9.pdf | last2=Abrishamkar | first2=Alireza | last3=Kay CEE 491 | first3=Yve | url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Sanxia Runner04 300.jpg|thumb|Three Gorges Dam [[Francis turbine]]]]\n\nThe generators were manufactured by two joint ventures: one of them [[Alstom]], [[ABB Group]], [[Kvaerner]], and the Chinese company Harbin Motor; the other [[Voith]], [[General Electric]], [[Siemens]] (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor.

The greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses [[Francis turbine]]s. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4&nbsp;m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75&nbsp;revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0[[Hertz|Hz]], the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 [[Volt ampere|MVA]], with a maximum of 840&nbsp;MVA and a [[power factor]] of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20&nbsp;[[Volt|kV]]. The electricity generated is then stepped-up to 500 [[Kilovolt|kV]] for transmission at 50&nbsp;Hz. The outer diameter of the generator [[stator]] is 21.4/20.9&nbsp;m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8&nbsp;m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3&nbsp;m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes.
