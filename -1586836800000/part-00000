With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.''<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|86}}\n\nOne of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:\n\n: <math>\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3 \\sqrt{1+\\cdots}}}.</math>\n\nHe waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.\n\n: <math>x+n+a = \\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\sqrt{\\cdots}}}</math>\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,\n# {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,\n# the denominator of {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,\n# {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1){{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1)''B<sub>n</sub>''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.\n\nIn his 17-page paper \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|91}} His writing initially had many flaws. As ''Journal'' editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:\n<blockquote>\nMr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seshu Iyer |first=P. V. |date=June 1920 |title=The Late Mr. S. Ramanujan, B.A., F.R.S.|journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society|volume=12 |issue=3 |page=83|ref=harv }}</ref></blockquote>\nRamanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the ''Journal''.<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> In early 1912 he got a temporary job in the Madras [[Accountant General]]'s office, with a monthly salary of 20 rupees. He lasted only a few weeks.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.</ref> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSir,<br>\n{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from [[E. W. Middlemast]], a mathematics professor at the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], who wrote that Ramanujan was \"a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics\".<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 49.</ref> Three weeks after he applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|96}} At his office Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given and spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.\n\n===Contacting British mathematicians===\nIn the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and [[E. W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability\", he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.<ref>Letter from M. J. M. Hill to a C. L. T. Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.</ref> Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he gave thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nThe first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|170\u2013171}} On 16 January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]]. Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snow|first=C.

Bauer]] in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called [[hypergeometric series]], which had first been researched by Euler and Gauss. Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers\u2013Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy said the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\",<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} and that they \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J. E. Littlewood]], to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were \"certainly the most remarkable I have received\" and that Ramanujan was \"a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power\".<ref name=\"Hardy1920\" />{{rp|494\u2013495}} One colleague, [[Eric Harold Neville|E.

Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip.<ref>Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 22 January 1914.</ref> In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to \"go to a foreign land\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|185}} Meanwhile, he sent Hardy a letter packed with theorems, writing, \"I have found a friend in you who views my labour sympathetically.\"<ref>Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 27 February 1913, [[Cambridge University Library]].</ref>\n\nTo supplement Hardy's endorsement, [[Gilbert Walker]], a former mathematical lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging the young man to spend time at Cambridge.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|175}} As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to a meeting of the Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss \"what we can do for S. Ramanujan\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ram|first=Suresh |title= Srinivasa Ramanujan |year= 1972|publisher= National Book Trust |location=New Delhi| page=29}}</ref> The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a monthly research scholarship of 75 rupees for the next two years at the [[University of Madras]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.'' In one instance Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, \"The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.\" Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}</ref> In his quarterly papers Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|183}}\n\nHardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; Neville said, \"Ramanujan needed no converting\" and \"his parents' opposition had been withdrawn\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Apparently Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her \"to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.\n\n==Life in England==\n[[File:RamanujanCambridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ramanujan (centre) and his colleague [[G.

''Nevasa'' on 17 March 1914.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|196}} When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|202}} [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G. H. |title= Ramanujan|year= 1940 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge| page=10}}</ref> Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood.

Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration\u2014a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917 Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.

His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in 1914\u201318. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency, and confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and in 1920 he died at the age of 32. After his death his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions.<ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nRamanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950 she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C. Berndt]] and [[B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s]] made it a point to visit her while in India.

Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most intriguing of these formulae include infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt 2}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.</math>\n\nThis result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = \u22124 \u00d7 58 = \u2212232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 \u00d7 9801 = 396<sup>2</sup>}}, which is related to the fact that\n\n:<math display=\"inline\"> e^{\\pi\\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\\dots. </math>\n\nThis might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan\u2013Sato series]].\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:\n\n{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&pg=PA185&dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref>}}\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left ( 1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} + \\left (1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cosh(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac {2 \\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac34 \\right )} \\pi = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{\\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac14 \\right )}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|\u0393(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]]. Expanding into series of powers and equating coefficients of {{math|''\u03b8''<sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|''\u03b8''<sup>4</sup>}}, and {{math|''\u03b8''<sup>8</sup>}} gives some deep identities for the [[hyperbolic secant]].\n\nIn 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan studied the [[Partition function (number theory)#Partition function|partition function]] {{math|''P''(''n'')}} extensively. They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. In 1937 [[Hans Rademacher]] refined their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method|circle method]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].\n\n===The Ramanujan conjecture===\n{{Main|Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjecture}}\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' one was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form \u0394(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.<ref name=ono/>\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function, whose coefficients are called {{math|''\u03c4''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= 9 |year= 1916 |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194\u2013197.</ref> He proved many congruences for these numbers, such as {{math|''\u03c4''(''p'') \u2261 1 + ''p''<sup>11</sup> mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of [[Galois module|Galois representations]] that \"explains\" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. {{math|\u0394(''z'')}} is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Ono |first1= Ken |authorlink1= Ken Ono |last2= Aczel|first2= Amir D. |authorlink2= Amir Aczel |title= My Search for Ramanujan: How I Learned to Count |date= 13 April 2016 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages= 236\u2013237 |isbn= 978-3319255668 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JZkFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=%22ideas+that+were+critical+to+the+proof+of+Fermat's+last+theorem%22#v=onepage&q=%22ideas%20that%20were%20critical%20to%20the%20proof%20of%20Fermat's%20last%20theorem%22&f=false |quote= ideas that were critical to the proof of Fermat's last theorem}}</ref>\n\n===Ramanujan's notebooks===\n{{Further|Ramanujan's lost notebook}}\n\nWhile still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of [[loose leaf|looseleaf]] paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his work to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\">{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0387949413 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks|last1 = Berndt|first1 = Bruce C.|date = 12 December 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, and the third 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself wrote papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\"/> in 1976 [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] rediscovered a fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|\"lost notebook\"]].<ref name=\"lostnotebook\"/>\n\n==Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number 1729==\n{{Main|1729 (number)}}\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.

It is perhaps useless to speculate as to his history had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six.

At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.\n\n: <math>x+n+a = \\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\sqrt{\\cdots}}}</math>\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,\n# {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,\n# the denominator of {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,\n# {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1){{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1)''B<sub>n</sub>''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.\n\nIn his 17-page paper \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|91}} His writing initially had many flaws.

He lasted only a few weeks.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.</ref> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSir,<br>\n{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances.

I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from [[E.

Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S.

W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability\", he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.<ref>Letter from M.

Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.</ref> Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he gave thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nThe first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|170\u2013171}} On 16 January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]]. Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snow|first=C.

Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers\u2013Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy said the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\",<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} and that they \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.

In one instance Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, \"The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.\" Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}</ref> In his quarterly papers Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|183}}\n\nHardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; Neville said, \"Ramanujan needed no converting\" and \"his parents' opposition had been withdrawn\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Apparently Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her \"to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.\n\n==Life in England==\n[[File:RamanujanCambridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ramanujan (centre) and his colleague [[G.

Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy.

Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G.

Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration\u2014a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917 Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.

His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in 1914\u201318. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency, and confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and in 1920 he died at the age of 32. After his death his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions.<ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nRamanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950 she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C. Berndt]] and [[B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s]] made it a point to visit her while in India.

Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most intriguing of these formulae include infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt 2}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.</math>\n\nThis result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = \u22124 \u00d7 58 = \u2212232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 \u00d7 9801 = 396<sup>2</sup>}}, which is related to the fact that\n\n:<math display=\"inline\"> e^{\\pi\\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\\dots. </math>\n\nThis might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan\u2013Sato series]].\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:\n\n{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&pg=PA185&dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref>}}\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left ( 1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} + \\left (1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cosh(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac {2 \\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac34 \\right )} \\pi = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{\\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac14 \\right )}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|\u0393(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]].

They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. In 1937 [[Hans Rademacher]] refined their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method|circle method]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].\n\n===The Ramanujan conjecture===\n{{Main|Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjecture}}\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' one was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form \u0394(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.<ref name=ono/>\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function, whose coefficients are called {{math|''\u03c4''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= 9 |year= 1916 |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194\u2013197.</ref> He proved many congruences for these numbers, such as {{math|''\u03c4''(''p'') \u2261 1 + ''p''<sup>11</sup> mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of [[Galois module|Galois representations]] that \"explains\" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. {{math|\u0394(''z'')}} is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations.

They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his work to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\">{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0387949413 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks|last1 = Berndt|first1 = Bruce C.|date = 12 December 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, and the third 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself wrote papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\"/> in 1976 [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] rediscovered a fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|\"lost notebook\"]].<ref name=\"lostnotebook\"/>\n\n==Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number 1729==\n{{Main|1729 (number)}}\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.

It is perhaps useless to speculate as to his history had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six. It is not extravagant to suppose that he might have become the greatest mathematician of his time. What he actually did is wonderful enough...when the researches which his work has suggested have been completed, it will probably seem a good deal more wonderful than it does to-day.<ref name=\"Hardy1920\"/>}}\n\nHardy further said:\n\n{{quote|He combined a power of generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out [[modular equation]]s and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a [[doubly periodic function]] or of [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy's theorem]], and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a [[complex variable]] was...\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |title = Ramanujan quote |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610103616/https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |archivedate = 10 June 2007 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said they were \"arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account.\"<ref name=\"cola1\">[https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html Srinivasa Ramanujan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325041218/https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html |date=25 March 2005 }}.

The paper published its first issue as ''The Daily Dispatch'' on July 1, 1871, as a four-page paper which cost 4\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|4|1871}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}) per copy. The paper was originally an afternoon paper for the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]], which at the time had a population of 32,000. For its first few years, the paper rented a headquarters on North High Street and Lynn Alley in Columbus. It began with 800 subscribers.<ref name=\"AboutUs\">{{citation|last=Deitch |first=Linda |title=Memorable milestones in Columbus Dispatch history |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/sections/services/about-history.html# |publisher=The Columbus Dispatch |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 1888, the paper published its first full-page advertisement, for the Columbus Buggy Company. In 1895, the paper moved its headquarters to the northeast corner of Gay and High streets, a larger building on a site which was previously a grocer. On April 10, the paper published a 72-page edition to mark the move. On December 17, 1899, the paper published its first Sunday edition, a 36-page paper which cost 3\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|3|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}), and the daily editions were reduced in price to 2\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|2|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Two years later on March 3, 1901, the paper published its first color [[comic strip]]s.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper, renamed ''The Columbus Evening Dispatch'', changed hands several times in its early years. In 1905, it was purchased by brothers Harry Preston Wolfe and Robert Frederick Wolfe, who originally ran a shoe company. It was not the Wolfes' first entry into journalism; they had purchased the ''[[Ohio State Journal]]'' two years before. The ''Dispatch'' would remain in the hands of the Wolfe family for 110 years. On December 16, 1906, the paper published its first color ad, for Beggs Store. On April 9, 1907, the ''Dispatch'' offices were destroyed in a fire, and the building was demolished and rebuilt. In the interlude, the paper ran its offices out of 34/36 North High Street.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper's editorial staff traditionally has had a [[conservatism|conservative]] slant.<ref name = \"Bwk\">Lucia Moses, ''\"The Columbus Dispatch\"'', ''[[Brandweek]]'', April 30, 2001</ref><ref name = \"CNN\">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/24/sm.02.html \"CNN Sunday Morning\" <nowiki>[transcript]</nowiki>], ''[[CNN]]'', October 24, 2004</ref><ref name = \"AN\">Terry Smith, [http://www.athensnews.com/component/content/article/4-letters/19092-wearing_thin_thanks_for_your_letters_without \"Wearing Thin: Thanks for your letters!

The paper published its first issue as ''The Daily Dispatch'' on July 1, 1871, as a four-page paper which cost 4\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|4|1871}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}) per copy. The paper was originally an afternoon paper for the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]], which at the time had a population of 32,000. For its first few years, the paper rented a headquarters on North High Street and Lynn Alley in Columbus. It began with 800 subscribers.<ref name=\"AboutUs\">{{citation|last=Deitch |first=Linda |title=Memorable milestones in Columbus Dispatch history |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/sections/services/about-history.html# |publisher=The Columbus Dispatch |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 1888, the paper published its first full-page advertisement, for the Columbus Buggy Company. In 1895, the paper moved its headquarters to the northeast corner of Gay and High streets, a larger building on a site which was previously a grocer. On April 10, the paper published a 72-page edition to mark the move. On December 17, 1899, the paper published its first Sunday edition, a 36-page paper which cost 3\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|3|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}), and the daily editions were reduced in price to 2\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|2|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Two years later on March 3, 1901, the paper published its first color [[comic strip]]s.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper, renamed ''The Columbus Evening Dispatch'', changed hands several times in its early years. In 1905, it was purchased by brothers Harry Preston Wolfe and Robert Frederick Wolfe, who originally ran a shoe company. It was not the Wolfes' first entry into journalism; they had purchased the ''[[Ohio State Journal]]'' two years before. The ''Dispatch'' would remain in the hands of the Wolfe family for 110 years. On December 16, 1906, the paper published its first color ad, for Beggs Store. On April 9, 1907, the ''Dispatch'' offices were destroyed in a fire, and the building was demolished and rebuilt. In the interlude, the paper ran its offices out of 34/36 North High Street.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper's editorial staff traditionally has had a [[conservatism|conservative]] slant.<ref name = \"Bwk\">Lucia Moses, ''\"The Columbus Dispatch\"'', ''[[Brandweek]]'', April 30, 2001</ref><ref name = \"CNN\">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/24/sm.02.html \"CNN Sunday Morning\" <nowiki>[transcript]</nowiki>], ''[[CNN]]'', October 24, 2004</ref><ref name = \"AN\">Terry Smith, [http://www.athensnews.com/component/content/article/4-letters/19092-wearing_thin_thanks_for_your_letters_without \"Wearing Thin: Thanks for your letters!

Dr. Chynn has been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, on CNN and Discovery Channel, in Time Magazine online, as well as on ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox News for LASEK as well as platinum  \"Eye Jewelry\" and corneal tattoos.  Dr. Chynn has also appeared on the Howard Stern Show as one of NYC's most eligible bachelors, as well on \"Millionaire Matchmaker\" with abrasive reality TV matchmaker [[Patti Stanger]].<ref>{{cite web | first =| title = 'Millionaire Matchmaker' Patti Stanger 'Set Me Up To Fail!'

He received his MD with honors in numerous rotations, including General Surgery from [[Columbia University]] College of Physicians & Surgeons in 1992. He completed his transitional internship at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center]] in [[Greenwich Village]], where he helped treat the victims of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. Chynn completed his residency in [[ophthalmology]] at [[Harvard University]]\u2019s [[Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary]] in 1996, and his fellowship in Corneal Transplantation and Refractive Surgery at [[Emory University]] in 1997 under the surgeons George Waring III, MD, the \"father of American refractive surgery\" who headed the influential PERK study, the 1st [[FDA]]-sponsored study about laser vision correction, and Doyle Stulting, MD, PhD, a future President of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS). He received his [[MBA]] in management with a Certificate in Entrepreneurship from [[New York University]]'s Stern School of Business in 2004.\n\n==Career==\nChynn was Director of Refractive Surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and then Director of Refractive Surgery and an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at SUNY Brooklyn/Long Island College Hospital. In the late 1990s he worked as a LASIK surgeon for TLC Manhattan, part of the TLC Laser Eye Centers, which was then the largest laser chain in North America, and listed in [[NASDAQ]].  In 1999, he became the 1st LASIK surgeon in [[New York City]] to get [[LASIK]] himself.<ref>{{cite web|first= |title=Dr. Chynn's story |url=http://www.parkavenuesafesight.com/about-dr-chynn/dr-chynns-story/ |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142611/http://www.parkavenuesafesight.com/about-dr-chynn/dr-chynns-story/ |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df= }}</ref> In 2000, he opened his own laser vision correction center, IWANT2020.com, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|first= |title=mol.net |url=http://www.mol.net/md/drchynn/ |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144538/http://www.mol.net/md/drchynn/ |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df= }}</ref>  He was a Resident Instructor and on the clinical faculty of [[Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital]], and [[New York Eye & Ear Infirmary]].\n\nHe served as an expert in [[ophthalmology]], [[cornea]], and [[visual science]] for Coleman Research Group and Gerson Lehrman Group, which are \"[[expert network]]s\" and as an [[equities analyst]] for various Wall Street firms.  He hosted his own cable TV show about refractive surgery on [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]], as well as a live call-in [[AM radio]] show on [[WEVD]] in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Chynn was the first physician to arrive at [[Ground Zero]] on [[9/11]], where he set up the first emergency room and [[triage]] center at a [[Burger King]] across the street from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].<ref>{{cite web|first= |title=My WTC Story, Emil Chynn |url=http://www.chynn911wtc.com/story.html |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413143444/http://www.chynn911wtc.com/story.html |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Chynn became the first laser vision correction surgeon in the New York Tri-State area to adopt exclusively Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA), which is an advancement on the older [[photorefractive keratectomy]] or PRK procedure, involving the non-cutting techniques LASEK and epi-LASEK, which have faster healing and recovery than PRK, but by avoiding cutting into the cornea, are safer than [[LASIK]]. In 2010, Dr. Chynn successfully performed the highest ASA procedure ever performed in the US, -22.00, on a patient from China.<ref>{{cite web|first=|title=SafeSight|url=http://www.parkavenuesafesight.com/safesight/|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017 Dr. Chynn has given several lectures in Ukraine to ophthalmologists in order to share the experience and provide a scholarship.

In 2016, Chynn was featured on [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Fox News]] as the first eye surgeon in the [[Americas]] to insert a cosmetic platinum implant into the eye, known as \"[[eye jewelry]]\".\n\n==Authorship and research==\nChynn is the co-author of over a dozen papers in [[peer reviewed journal]]s about laser vision correction, including first-author articles in Ophthalmology, Archives of Ophthalmology, the American Journal of Ophthalmology, and the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

In past times they were also famous for their ironworking skills, as the country and its neighbors possess rich deposits of iron.  Kissi smiths produced the famous \"[[Kissi penny]],\" iron money that was used widely in West and even Central Africa.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Kissi are primarily farmers. Rice, their staple crop, is grown on most hillsides and in low, [[swamp]]y areas. Other crops include peanuts, cotton, corn, bananas, potatoes, and melons. Beans, tomatoes, onions, and peppers are grown in small vegetable gardens, and coffee raised as a cash crop. Most of the farmers also raise some livestock.\n\nAgricultural work, such as sowing, weeding, and harvesting, is shared equally by the men and women. Additional responsibilities for the men include [[hunting]], fishing, and clearing land. The women's duties involve caring for the small vegetable gardens, tending to the chickens, trading in the local markets, and doing some fishing. Boys tend to livestock, which is usually cattle and goats. Cows are considered valuable animals, not for their milk, but as religious sacrifices.\n\n==Resistance to French conquest by Kissi Kaba Keita==\nIn Guinea, the Kissi warrior [[Kissi Kaba Keita]] managed to unite many Kissi chiefdoms under his reign and resist French conquest for many years. Before French attacks, he had rallied the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko's]] of Morige and the [[Lele language (Guinea)|Lele's]] of [[Yombiro]]. When the French arrived in 1892, he had to let the relatively autonomous chiefs of the respective areas defend themselves. Due to the French's technological superiority, Kissi Kaba resorted mainly to guerilla tactics, thus delaying their conquest of his kingdom. Still, by 1893 he realized that his resistance would fail and subjected himself to the French, who then recognized him as chief of the northern Kissi territory. However, his relationship with the French gradually worsened, which led to them appointing his rivals in a number of his chiefdoms, and eventually to his execution in [[Siguiri]].\n\n==Social systems==\nFor many generations, Kissi are well known as hard-working people. They are very age-oriented, dominated and led by the [[Tribal chief|chief]] and the elderly people. The Kissi live in small, self-governing [[villages]] that are tucked inside groves of mango or kola trees. Each village is compact, containing no more than about 150 people. Houses are usually raised slightly above the ground and are round with mud walls, cone-shaped thatch roofs, and verandahs. In the center of the village is a public square with a dwelling place for the village headman. He offers sacrifices at the village shrine and acts as judge over the community.\n\nTo the Kissi, a child is not considered \"complete\" and is thought of as dirty and impure. Therefore, when a boy or girl reaches [[puberty]], a [[Ritual purification| purification]] ritual is held. This ceremony, called a biriye, \"cleanses\" the child and ushers them into adulthood. Afterwards, the young adult is expected to take on adult responsibilities.\n\nMusic plays a unique role in the Kissi culture. Sometimes, it is used for certain types of communication. The music does not necessarily have a melody, but rather a rhythmic sound with much drumming and whistling.\n\n==Religion and spiritual beliefs==\nAlthough many Kissi have converted to Christianity, most of them continue to practice their traditional ethnic religion. [[Ancestor worship]] or praying to deceased relatives is a common practice among the Kissi. The Kissi believe that ancestral spirits act as mediators between them and the creator, god. Small stone statues are used to represent the spirits. They are worshipped and offered sacrifices by the village headmen.  Many carved [[soapstone]] figures and heads were produced by the Kissi people in the past prior to colonial contact with the Europeans. It is not clear why they were made; some scholars argue that they form part of ancestor worship while others say they may represent gods to increase agricultural yields. A large number can be seen in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Sierra+Leone+soapstone British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Kissi constantly live in fear of the [[supernatural]]. They wear charms in order to protect themselves from the evil spirits. [[Witchcraft]] is also practiced by sorcerers and witches. Some of the elders and religious leaders communicate with spirits through trances and hypnosis. The biriye and other rituals are held in the forest since this is thought to be a sacred setting.\n\nThe Kissi reside in an area affected by the [[Ebola virus]], and the customs of the people are a substantial contributing factor to the spread of [[Ebola virus disease]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/health/ebola-outbreak-west-africa/ Ebola outbreak: 11 African nations agree to plan to tackle deadly epidemic]</ref>\n\n==Kissi people== \n*[[Kissi Kaba Keita]], a warrior who resisted French conquest from 1892 on.\n*[[Kai Londo]], great Kissi warrior from Sierra Leone who conquered a large territory and ruled with wisdom in Southern Sierra Leone.\n*[[Pascal Feindouno]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Tamba Hali]], defensive end for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]\n*[[Simon Feindouno]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Joseph Boakai]], former vice president of Liberia\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Kamano]], Guinean footballer\n*[[Tom Nyuma]], a retired colonel in the Sierra Leonean Armed Forces, and the current council chairman of [[Kailahun]] District\n*[[Jusu Sawie]], member of Sierra Leone's parliament representing Kailahun District\n*[[Kai Abdul Foday]], member of Sierra Leone's parliament representing [[Kono District]]\n*[[Augustine Kortu]], Sierra Leonean politician   \n*[[Tamba Borbor-Sawyer]], [[Sierra Leonean]] politician and a retired officer in the [[Sierra Leone Police]].\n*[[King James Cleveland]], [[:wiki: Euro-african|Euro-african]] son of Ndamba and [[William Clevland (king)|William Clevland]].\n*Daniel N.
