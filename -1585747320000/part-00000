His wardship and marriage were sold by the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to her kinsman, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham]], for \u00a31000. According to Akrigg, Howard then \"entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands\", and late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age, came to live at [[Cecil House]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=21\u20133}}.</ref>\n\nIn October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]],<ref>Cokayne states that he matriculated 11 December 1585.</ref> graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589.<ref>{{acad|id=WRTY585H|name=Wriothesley, Henry, 4th Earl of Southampton}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=28, 30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.</ref> His name was entered at the [[Gray's Inn]] legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.</ref>\n\nOn Southampton's 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton's age in his diary, and by 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and Southampton's mother, [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary]], for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth Vere]], daughter of Burghley's daughter, [[Anne Cecil]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].{{sfn|Honan|2012}} However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]] reported the rumour that \"The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth \u00a35000 of present payment\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=31\u20132, 39}}; {{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|pp=35\u20138, 86}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1591 Lord Burghley's Clerk in Chancery, [[John Clapham (historian and poet)|John Clapham]], dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, ''Narcissus'', recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in late September 1592, and was praised fulsomely in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen's visit. In October 1592 Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu|Viscount Montague]], died. Montague had been a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 May 1593 [[Philip Gawdy]] of [[Clifford's Inn]] (a law school and [[Inn of Chancery]]) wrote to his brother, [[Bassingbourne Gawdy (died 1606)|Bassingbourne Gawdy]], that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the [[John Puckering|Lord Keeper]], [[Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh|Lord Burgh]], and [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby de Eresby]]. Shortly thereafter, in his ''Honour of the Garter'' dated 26 June 1593, [[George Peele]] referred to him as \"Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton's star\", claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=33\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Romilly|1879|pp=521\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Dyce|1829|p=233}}.</ref> However it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under [[James VI and I|King James]].\n\n==Southampton and Shakespeare==\n[[File:Miniature of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, 1594. (Fitzwilliam Museum) cropped.png|thumb|160px|right|Henry Wriothesley at 21]]\n[[File:Dedication page of The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare 1594.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Dedication (publishing)|dedication]] to Southampton of ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', 1594]]\nIn 1593 [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] dedicated his narrative poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' to Southampton, followed in 1594 by ''The Rape of Lucrece''. Although the dedication to ''Venus and Adonis'' is more restrained, the dedication to ''The Rape of Lucrece'' is couched in extravagant terms:\n<blockquote>\nThe love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours.\n</blockquote>\nThis type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual though, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author's work \u2013 mainly for political and, above all, financial reasons.\n\n[[Nathan Drake (essayist and physician)|Nathan Drake]], in ''Shakespeare and his Times'', was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare's two long narrative poems, but also the \"Fair Youth\" of the ''Sonnets''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|p=62}}.</ref> The title page refers to the \"onlie begetter of these {{Not a typo|in|suing}} [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|sonnets]] Mr W.H.,\" and it had earlier been inferred that the ''Sonnets'' were addressed to \"Mr. W.H.\". Drake, however, adopting [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|Chalmers']] suggestion that one meaning of \"beget\" is \"bring forth\", argued that Mr. W.H. was merely the procurer of the manuscript rather than the \"Fair Youth\" addressed in the poems.<ref>{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|pp=58\u20139}}.</ref> Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the ''Sonnets'' have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity.{{sfn|Honan|1998|p=361}} However, Honan argues that although Southampton\n<blockquote>\nmay be involved in Shakespeare's sonnets ... there is no real likelihood that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly \"lascivious\" (sonnet 95), \"sensual\" to a \"fault\" or to his \"shame\" (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with vices.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}\n</blockquote>\nDespite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare's two long narrative poems. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], on the authority of poet and playwright [[William Davenant]] (1606 \u2013 7&nbsp;April 1668), stated in his ''Life of Shakespeare'' that Southampton once gave Shakespeare \u00a31,000 to \"go through with a purchase,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Nicholas|title=Some Account of the Life, &c. of Mr. William Shakespear|date=1709|publisher=Jacob Tonson|location=London|page=x [i.e., Roman numeral 10]}}</ref> but Honan terms this a myth.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}\n\n==The 1590s==\nSouthampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s. On 27 June 1593 [[Thomas Nashe]] completed his [[picaresque novel]], ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'', and dedicated it to Southampton,<ref>The dedication was withdrawn from the second edition.</ref> terming him \"a dere lover and cherisher ... as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves\",<ref>{{Harvnb|McKerrow|1958|pp=252, 255}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=37\u20138}}.</ref> and in 1593 [[Barnabe Barnes]] published ''Parthenophil and Parthenope'' with a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=38}}.</ref> In 1595 [[Gervase Markham]] included a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton in ''The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steggle|2004}}.</ref> On 2 March 1596 [[Giovanni Florio|John Florio's]] Italian/English dictionary was entered in the Stationers' Register.<ref>It was not published until 1598.</ref> In his dedication, Florio, who was for some years in the Earl's \"pay and patronage\", complimented Southampton on his fluency in Italian, saying he \"had become so complete a master of Italian as to have no need of travel abroad to perfect his mastery of that tongue\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=53}}.</ref> In 1597 [[Henry Lok]] included a sonnet to Southampton among the sixty dedicatory sonnets in his ''Sundry Christian Passions''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=53\u20134}}.</ref> In the same year [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]] dedicated to him a translation of [[Achilles Tatius]]'s, ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon|Clitophon and Leucippe]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=54}}.</ref>\n\nOn 4 October 1594 Southampton's friend, [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], shot Henry Long, brother of Sir Walter Long, in the course of a local feud between the Danvers and Long families. Sir Henry and his elder brother, [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]], fled to [[Titchfield]], where Southampton sheltered them. The brothers were outlawed, and eventually escaped to the continent where they took refuge at the court of [[Henri IV of France|King Henri IV]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41\u20135}}.</ref>\n\nOn 17 November 1595, Southampton [[jousting|jousted]] in Queen Elizabeth's [[Accession Day tilt|accession day tournament]], earning a mention in George Peele's ''Anglorum Feriae'' as \"gentle and debonaire\". However, according to Akrigg, \"Gentle and debonair he may have been, but we never again hear of Southampton being high in the graces of Queen Elizabeth\".<ref>{{harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=48}}.</ref>\n\nOn 13 April 1596 the Queen specifically instructed [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], not to take either Southampton or the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]],<ref>According to Akrigg, Southampton and Derby were \"rather close friends at this period\"; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=56}}.</ref> with him on an expedition for the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|Relief of Calais]], and it also appears that Southampton did not accompany Essex on the [[Capture of C\u00e1diz|Cadiz Expedition]] that summer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=56\u20139}}; Honan states that Southampton did go with Essex to Cadiz; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.</ref> In February 1597 Southampton challenged the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] to a duel with rapiers, requiring intervention by the Queen and Privy Council, and on 1 March stood godfather at the christening of [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sidney's]] daughter, Bridget. Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his \"inglorious\" [[Islands Voyage|Voyage to the Azores]], where according to Rowland Whyte, \"My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the [[Philip II of Spain|Kings]] great Men of Warre, and suncke her\". On his return he made his first appearance in the [[House of Lords]] on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a \"chronic absentee\". By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=58, 67}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with [[Ambrose Willoughby]],<ref>Ambrose Willoughby, second son of [[Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham]], is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] to [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Sir Dudley Carleton]]: \"[[Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos|Gray Bridges]] hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges\"; {{Harvnb|McClure|1939|p=150}}.</ref> one of the Queen's [[esquires of the body]], who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at [[primero]] after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and \"Willoughby puld of some of his locke\", for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying \"he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.</ref> There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], one of the Queen's [[Maid of Honour|Maids of Honour]]. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that \"My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym\". Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen's disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] on an embassy to [[Henri IV of France]]. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in [[Angers]], where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=68\u20139}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]] and [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]]. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the [[Fleet Prison]] for marrying without royal permission.\n\nThe Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Dowager Countess]], over her prospective marriage to [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Henry Howard]] was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41\u20136, 69\u201374}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1599, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595\u20131603), Southampton went to [[Essex in Ireland|Ireland with Essex]], who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at [[Arklow]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Shortly after the [[Essex's Rebellion]] in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]]. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=181\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=484\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nI do mervell also what becam of pearse edmones, the earle of Essex man, borne in strand neare me, and which has had many rewards & preferments by the earle essex, his villany I have often complained of, he dweles in London, he was corporall generall of the horse in Ierland under the earle of Sowthamton, he eate & drank at his table and lay in his tente, the earle of Sowthamton gave him a horse, which edmones refused a 100 markes for him, the earle Sowthamton would cole and huge him in his armes and play wantonly with him. This pearse began to fawne and flatter me in Ierland offering me great curtesie, telling me what pay grases & giftes they earles bestowed uppon him, therby seming to move and anymate me to desiar and looke for the like favour, But I coeld never love & afecte them to make them my frends, esspecially essex whoes mynd I ever mistrusted....\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Duncan-Jones, Reynolds' letter hints that 'rewards could be obtained from either or both of the two Earls in return for sexual favours'. On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had \"complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones & sodometicall sines over flowing this land\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=481, 482, 484}}.</ref>\n\nOn his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. \"My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland,\" wrote [[Rowland Whyte]] to [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sydney]] in 1599, \"come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1844|p=clxxiii}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=96}}.</ref>\n\nSouthampton was deeply involved in the [[Essex's Rebellion]] of 1601, and in February of that year he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency,  obtained the [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of his penalty to [[life imprisonment]].\n\n==Life under King James==\n[[Image:HenryWriothesley 1594.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton c. 1600]]\n[[File:Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|Southampton]]\nOn the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex he had induced the players at the [[Globe Theatre]] to revive ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and on his release from prison in 1603 he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605 he entertained [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] with a performance of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' by [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged, at Southampton House.<ref>HMC: ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', vol. 16, p. 415, letter of Walter Cope to Robert Cecil about Burbage.</ref>\n\nHe seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. He was a volunteer on the [[Protestant]] side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the [[Barbary pirates]].\n\nSouthampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices{{snd}}\"in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization.\"<ref>Margot Heinemann, \"Rebel Lords, Popular Playwrights, and Political Culture: Notes on the Jacobean Patronage of the Earl of Southampton,\" in Brown;  p.  139.</ref> He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at [[Titchfield]]. He developed his properties in London, in [[Bloomsbury]] and [[Holborn]]; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[New England Company]], and backed [[Henry Hudson]]'s search for the [[Northwest Passage]].\n\nA significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of [[George Chapman]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Thomas Heywood]], and the composer [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]]. Heywood's popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton's maritime and colonial interests.<ref>Consider Heywood's ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', ''[[Fortune by Land and Sea]]'', and ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]''; Heinemann, pp. 142\u201347.</ref>\n\n==Virginia Company==\n[[File:Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton after Daniel Mytens.jpg|left|thumb|The Earl of Southampton c.1618, after a portrait by [[Daniel Mytens]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]\nHenry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the [[New World Tapestry]], took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company]]'s governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Edwin Sandys]], who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton's faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished.\n\nHis name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of [[Hampton Roads]], and the [[Hampton River]]. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of [[Hampton, Virginia]], as well as [[Southampton County, Virginia]] and [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]]. However, the name [[Southampton]] was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of [[Hampshire]]. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London's efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable.\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn 1624, Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the [[Low Countries]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]]. Shortly after their arrival, the earl's eldest son, [[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley|James Wriothesley]], succumbed to a fever at Rosendael. Five days later, on 10&nbsp;November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at [[Bergen-op-Zoom]], aged&nbsp;51. Both were buried in the parish church of [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2019}}\n[[Image:Elizabeth Vernon Countess of Southampton c 1618.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth, Countess of Southampton c.&nbsp;1618]]\nIn August&nbsp;1598, Southampton secretly married [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], the daughter of John Vernon of [[Hodnet]], Shropshire, by his wife Elizabeth Devereux. Elizabeth Devereux's grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon; on her father John's side, Elizabeth's family were more obscure.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was pregnant she wrote to her husband asking him to buy her a stomacher of scarlet cloth lined with plush to keep her warm while riding, and bring his portrait 'very finely done'.<ref>''HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury'', vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 203-4.</ref>\n\nThey had several children, including:\n*Penelope Wriothesley, who married [[William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton]].\n*[[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley]] (1&nbsp;March 1605 &ndash; 5 November 1624), who died five days before his father, of the same illness.\n*[[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton]] (10&nbsp;March 1607 &ndash; 16&nbsp;May 1667).\n*Anne Wriothesley, who married [[Robert Wallop]] (20&nbsp;July 1601 &ndash; 19&nbsp;November 1667) of Farley Wallop.\n\n==Portraits==\nThere exist numerous portraits of Southampton, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare's description of \"a man right fair.\" [[John Beaumont (poet)|Sir John Beaumont]] wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled ''Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex'' (1624).\n\nIn 2002, a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Showing him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe [[Cobbe portrait#Cobbe portrait of Southampton|portrait of Southampton]].<ref name = \"sou\">{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation| author=Anthony Holden| title= That's no lady, that's...| publisher=[[The Observer]]| date=21 April 2002| accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, a further portrait believed to be of Southampton, hidden beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, was discovered when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition.<ref>{{Cite book  | title = X-rays uncover 'hidden portrait'  | publisher = BBC News  | date = 29 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7372629.stm}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Earl has been played on screen by several different actors:\n*[[Peter Egan]] in the [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', 1971.\n*[[Nicholas Clay]] in the TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Life of Shakespeare]]'', 1978.\n*[[Eddie Redmayne]] in the [[Channel 4]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'', 2005.\n*[[Shaun Evans]] in the mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', 2006.\n*[[Xavier Samuel]] in the feature film ''[[Anonymous (2011 film)|Anonymous]]'', 2011.\n*Adam Harley in the sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', 2016.\n*[[Ian McKellen]] in the feature film ''[[All Is True]]'', 2018.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |last=Akrigg |first=G.P.V. |year=1968 |title=Shakespeare and the Earl of Southampton |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Rowse |first=A.L. |year=1965 |title=Shakespeare's Southampton: Patron of Virginia |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Cokayne |first=G.E. |year=1953 |title=The Complete Peerage edited by Geoffrey H.

His wardship and marriage were sold by the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to her kinsman, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham]], for \u00a31000. According to Akrigg, Howard then \"entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands\", and late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age, came to live at [[Cecil House]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=21\u20133}}.</ref>\n\nIn October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]],<ref>Cokayne states that he matriculated 11 December 1585.</ref> graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589.<ref>{{acad|id=WRTY585H|name=Wriothesley, Henry, 4th Earl of Southampton}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=28, 30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.</ref> His name was entered at the [[Gray's Inn]] legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.</ref>\n\nOn Southampton's 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton's age in his diary, and by 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and Southampton's mother, [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary]], for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth Vere]], daughter of Burghley's daughter, [[Anne Cecil]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].{{sfn|Honan|2012}} However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]] reported the rumour that \"The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth \u00a35000 of present payment\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=31\u20132, 39}}; {{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|pp=35\u20138, 86}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1591 Lord Burghley's Clerk in Chancery, [[John Clapham (historian and poet)|John Clapham]], dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, ''Narcissus'', recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in late September 1592, and was praised fulsomely in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen's visit. In October 1592 Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu|Viscount Montague]], died. Montague had been a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 May 1593 Philip Gawdy of [[Clifford's Inn]] (a law school and [[Inn of Chancery]]) wrote to his brother, [[Bassingbourne Gawdy (died 1606)|Bassingbourne Gawdy]], that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the [[John Puckering|Lord Keeper]], [[Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh|Lord Burgh]], and [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby de Eresby]]. Shortly thereafter, in his ''Honour of the Garter'' dated 26 June 1593, [[George Peele]] referred to him as \"Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton's star\", claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=33\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Romilly|1879|pp=521\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Dyce|1829|p=233}}.</ref> However it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under [[James VI and I|King James]].\n\n==Southampton and Shakespeare==\n[[File:Miniature of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, 1594.

Although the dedication to ''Venus and Adonis'' is more restrained, the dedication to ''The Rape of Lucrece'' is couched in extravagant terms:\n<blockquote>\nThe love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours.\n</blockquote>\nThis type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual though, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author's work \u2013 mainly for political and, above all, financial reasons.\n\n[[Nathan Drake (essayist and physician)|Nathan Drake]], in ''Shakespeare and his Times'', was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare's two long narrative poems, but also the \"Fair Youth\" of the ''Sonnets''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|p=62}}.</ref> The title page refers to the \"onlie begetter of these {{Not a typo|in|suing}} [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|sonnets]] Mr W.H.,\" and it had earlier been inferred that the ''Sonnets'' were addressed to \"Mr. W.H.\". Drake, however, adopting [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|Chalmers']] suggestion that one meaning of \"beget\" is \"bring forth\", argued that Mr. W.H. was merely the procurer of the manuscript rather than the \"Fair Youth\" addressed in the poems.<ref>{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|pp=58\u20139}}.</ref> Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the ''Sonnets'' have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity.{{sfn|Honan|1998|p=361}} However, Honan argues that although Southampton\n<blockquote>\nmay be involved in Shakespeare's sonnets ... there is no real likelihood that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly \"lascivious\" (sonnet 95), \"sensual\" to a \"fault\" or to his \"shame\" (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with vices.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}\n</blockquote>\nDespite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare's two long narrative poems. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], on the authority of poet and playwright [[William Davenant]] (1606 \u2013 7&nbsp;April 1668), stated in his ''Life of Shakespeare'' that Southampton once gave Shakespeare \u00a31,000 to \"go through with a purchase,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Nicholas|title=Some Account of the Life, &c. of Mr. William Shakespear|date=1709|publisher=Jacob Tonson|location=London|page=x [i.e., Roman numeral 10]}}</ref> but Honan terms this a myth.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}\n\n==The 1590s==\nSouthampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s.

Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his \"inglorious\" [[Islands Voyage|Voyage to the Azores]], where according to Rowland Whyte, \"My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the [[Philip II of Spain|Kings]] great Men of Warre, and suncke her\". On his return he made his first appearance in the [[House of Lords]] on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a \"chronic absentee\". By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=58, 67}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with [[Ambrose Willoughby]],<ref>Ambrose Willoughby, second son of [[Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham]], is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] to [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Sir Dudley Carleton]]: \"[[Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos|Gray Bridges]] hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges\"; {{Harvnb|McClure|1939|p=150}}.</ref> one of the Queen's [[esquires of the body]], who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at [[primero]] after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and \"Willoughby puld of some of his locke\", for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying \"he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.</ref> There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], one of the Queen's [[Maid of Honour|Maids of Honour]]. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that \"My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym\". Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen's disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] on an embassy to [[Henri IV of France]]. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in [[Angers]], where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=68\u20139}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]] and [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]]. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the [[Fleet Prison]] for marrying without royal permission.\n\nThe Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Dowager Countess]], over her prospective marriage to [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Henry Howard]] was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41\u20136, 69\u201374}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1599, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595\u20131603), Southampton went to [[Essex in Ireland|Ireland with Essex]], who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at [[Arklow]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Shortly after the [[Essex's Rebellion]] in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]]. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:<ref>{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=181\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=484\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nI do mervell also what becam of pearse edmones, the earle of Essex man, borne in strand neare me, and which has had many rewards & preferments by the earle essex, his villany I have often complained of, he dweles in London, he was corporall generall of the horse in Ierland under the earle of Sowthamton, he eate & drank at his table and lay in his tente, the earle of Sowthamton gave him a horse, which edmones refused a 100 markes for him, the earle Sowthamton would cole and huge him in his armes and play wantonly with him.

On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had \"complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones & sodometicall sines over flowing this land\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=481, 482, 484}}.</ref>\n\nOn his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. \"My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland,\" wrote [[Rowland Whyte]] to [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sydney]] in 1599, \"come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Collier|1844|p=clxxiii}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=96}}.</ref>\n\nSouthampton was deeply involved in the [[Essex's Rebellion]] of 1601, and in February of that year he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency,  obtained the [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of his penalty to [[life imprisonment]].\n\n==Life under King James==\n[[Image:HenryWriothesley 1594.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton c. 1600]]\n[[File:Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|Southampton]]\nOn the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex he had induced the players at the [[Globe Theatre]] to revive ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and on his release from prison in 1603 he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605 he entertained [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] with a performance of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' by [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged, at Southampton House.<ref>HMC: ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', vol. 16, p. 415, letter of Walter Cope to Robert Cecil about Burbage.</ref>\n\nHe seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. He was a volunteer on the [[Protestant]] side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the [[Barbary pirates]].\n\nSouthampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices{{snd}}\"in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization.\"<ref>Margot Heinemann, \"Rebel Lords, Popular Playwrights, and Political Culture: Notes on the Jacobean Patronage of the Earl of Southampton,\" in Brown;  p.  139.</ref> He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at [[Titchfield]]. He developed his properties in London, in [[Bloomsbury]] and [[Holborn]]; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[New England Company]], and backed [[Henry Hudson]]'s search for the [[Northwest Passage]].\n\nA significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of [[George Chapman]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Thomas Heywood]], and the composer [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]]. Heywood's popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton's maritime and colonial interests.<ref>Consider Heywood's ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', ''[[Fortune by Land and Sea]]'', and ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]''; Heinemann, pp. 142\u201347.</ref>\n\n==Virginia Company==\n[[File:Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton after Daniel Mytens.jpg|left|thumb|The Earl of Southampton c.1618, after a portrait by [[Daniel Mytens]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]\nHenry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the [[New World Tapestry]], took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company]]'s governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Edwin Sandys]], who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton's faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished.\n\nHis name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of [[Hampton Roads]], and the [[Hampton River]]. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of [[Hampton, Virginia]], as well as [[Southampton County, Virginia]] and [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]]. However, the name [[Southampton]] was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of [[Hampshire]]. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London's efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable.\n\n==Later life and death==\nIn 1624, Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the [[Low Countries]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]]. Shortly after their arrival, the earl's eldest son, [[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley|James Wriothesley]], succumbed to a fever at Rosendael. Five days later, on 10&nbsp;November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at [[Bergen-op-Zoom]], aged&nbsp;51. Both were buried in the parish church of [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2019}}\n[[Image:Elizabeth Vernon Countess of Southampton c 1618.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth, Countess of Southampton c.&nbsp;1618]]\nIn August&nbsp;1598, Southampton secretly married [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], the daughter of John Vernon of [[Hodnet]], Shropshire, by his wife Elizabeth Devereux. Elizabeth Devereux's grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon; on her father John's side, Elizabeth's family were more obscure.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was pregnant she wrote to her husband asking him to buy her a stomacher of scarlet cloth lined with plush to keep her warm while riding, and bring his portrait 'very finely done'.<ref>''HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury'', vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 203-4.</ref>\n\nThey had several children, including:\n*Penelope Wriothesley, who married [[William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton]].\n*[[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley]] (1&nbsp;March 1605 &ndash; 5 November 1624), who died five days before his father, of the same illness.\n*[[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton]] (10&nbsp;March 1607 &ndash; 16&nbsp;May 1667).\n*Anne Wriothesley, who married [[Robert Wallop]] (20&nbsp;July 1601 &ndash; 19&nbsp;November 1667) of Farley Wallop.\n\n==Portraits==\nThere exist numerous portraits of Southampton, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare's description of \"a man right fair.\" [[John Beaumont (poet)|Sir John Beaumont]] wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled ''Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex'' (1624).\n\nIn 2002, a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Showing him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe [[Cobbe portrait#Cobbe portrait of Southampton|portrait of Southampton]].<ref name = \"sou\">{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation| author=Anthony Holden| title= That's no lady, that's...| publisher=[[The Observer]]| date=21 April 2002| accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, a further portrait believed to be of Southampton, hidden beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, was discovered when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition.<ref>{{Cite book  | title = X-rays uncover 'hidden portrait'  | publisher = BBC News  | date = 29 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7372629.stm}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Earl has been played on screen by several different actors:\n*[[Peter Egan]] in the [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', 1971.\n*[[Nicholas Clay]] in the TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Life of Shakespeare]]'', 1978.\n*[[Eddie Redmayne]] in the [[Channel 4]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'', 2005.\n*[[Shaun Evans]] in the mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', 2006.\n*[[Xavier Samuel]] in the feature film ''[[Anonymous (2011 film)|Anonymous]]'', 2011.\n*Adam Harley in the sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', 2016.\n*[[Ian McKellen]] in the feature film ''[[All Is True]]'', 2018.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |last=Akrigg |first=G.P.V. |year=1968 |title=Shakespeare and the Earl of Southampton |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Rowse |first=A.L. |year=1965 |title=Shakespeare's Southampton: Patron of Virginia |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Cokayne |first=G.E. |year=1953 |title=The Complete Peerage edited by Geoffrey H.
