{"title_page": "Deregulation", "text_new": "'''Deregulation''' is the process of removing or reducing state regulations, typically in the economic sphere.  It is the repeal of governmental [[Economic regulation|regulation of the economy]].  It became common in advanced industrial economies in the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of new trends in economic thinking about the inefficiencies of [[government regulation]], and the risk that regulatory agencies would be controlled by the regulated industry to its benefit, and thereby hurt consumers and the wider economy.\n\nEconomic regulations were promoted during the [[Gilded Age]], in which [[progressive era|progressive]] reforms were touted as necessary to limit [[externalities]] like corporate abuse, unsafe [[child labor]], [[monopolization]], [[pollution]], and to mitigate boom and bust cycles. Around the late 1970s, such reforms were deemed as burdensome on economic growth and many politicians espousing [[neoliberalism]] started promoting deregulation.\n\n[[File:France Telecom Wellington NZ.jpg|thumb|150px|As a result of deregulation, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] operates phone booths in Wellington, New Zealand.]]\nThe stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to raised levels of competitiveness, therefore higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], more efficiency and lower prices overall. Opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding [[pollution|environmental pollution]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90017-5|title=An ecological-economic assessment of deregulation of international commerce under GATT|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=9|pages=73\u201392|year=1994|last1=Daly|first1=Herman|last2=Goodland|first2=Robert}}</ref> and environmental quality standards (such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials), financial uncertainty, and [[Competition law|constraining monopolies]].\n\n[[Regulatory reform]] is a parallel development alongside deregulation. Regulatory reform refers to organized and ongoing programs to review regulations with a view to minimizing, simplifying, and making them more cost effective.  Such efforts, given impetus by the ''[[Regulatory Flexibility Act]]'' of 1980, are embodied in the United States Office of Management and Budget's [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], and the United Kingdom's [[Better Regulation Commission]]. [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis]] is frequently used in such reviews. In addition, there have been regulatory innovations, usually suggested by economists, such as [[emissions trading]].\n\nDeregulation can be distinguished from [[privatization]], where privatization can be seen as taking state-owned service providers into the private sector.\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[Argentina]] underwent heavy economic deregulation, [[privatization]], and had a [[fixed exchange rate]] during the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] administration (1989\u20131999).  In December 2001, [[Paul Krugman]] compared [[Enron]] with Argentina, claiming that both were experiencing economic collapse due to excessive deregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Krugman | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Krugman\n | title = Laissez Not Fair | journal = The New York Times\n | date = December 11, 2001\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/opinion/laissez-not-fair.html\n | accessdate = June 10, 2011}}</ref> Two months later, Herbert Inhaber claimed that Krugman [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]], and neither collapse was due to excessive deregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Inhaber | first = Herbert\n | title = Deregulation and Its Discontents | journal = Ideas in Action\n | date =  February 12, 2002\n | url = http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2002/02/deregulation-and-its-discontents.html\n | accessdate = June 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nHaving announced a wide range of deregulatory policies, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] announced the policy of \"Minimum Effective Regulation\" in 1986. This introduced now familiar requirements for \"regulatory impact statements\", but compliance by governmental agencies took many years. The labour market under the Hawke/Keating Labor governments operated under [[Prices and Incomes Accord|an accord]]. [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia]]  in 1996 [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|began deregulation]] of the labor market, subsequently taken much further in 2005  through their [[WorkChoices]] policy. However, it was reversed under the following [[Rudd Government (2007\u201310)|Rudd Labor government]].\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Ontario electricity policy}}\n\nNatural gas is deregulated in most of the country, with the exception of some Atlantic provinces and some pockets like Vancouver Island and Medicine Hat.   Most of this deregulation happened in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"PIAC\">{{citation\n |title=Ontario Electricity Restructuring \n |chapter=A Funny Thing happened On the Way to Utopia \n |publisher=[[Public Interest Advocacy Centre]] \n |date=11 November 2002 \n |chapter-url=http://www.piac.ca/energy/ontario_electricity_restructuring/ \n |accessdate=2009-04-26 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607083903/http://www.piac.ca/energy/ontario_electricity_restructuring/ \n |archivedate=7 June 2008 \n}}</ref>  There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in some of these jurisdictions, particularly Ontario, Alberta and BC.   The other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers.   Customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company (LDC) or a deregulated supplier.   In most provinces the LDC is not allowed to offer a term contract, just a variable price based on the spot market.   LDC prices are changed either monthly or quarterly.\n\nThe province of [[Ontario]] began deregulation of electricity supply in 2002, but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility.<ref name=\"PIAC\"/> The government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework.\n\nThe current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation. The remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers.  However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision. Customers are free to choose which company they sign up with, but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition.   If they choose they may remain with the utility at the Regulated Rate Option.\n\nFormer Premier Ralph Klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the Enron model, and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous [[Enron#California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis|California electricity crisis]] (and the collapse of [[Enron scandal|Enron]] because of illegal accounting practices.)\n\n=== European Union ===\n* 2003 Corrections to EU directive about [[software patent]]s\n* Deregulation of the [[aircraft|air industry]] in Europe in 1992 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe taxi industry was deregulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] leading to an influx of new taxis. This was due to the price of a licence dropping overnight. The number of taxis increased dramatically.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0516/primetimeinvestigates.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Prime Time Investigates |date=2011-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628182209/http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0516/primetimeinvestigates.html |archivedate=2012-06-28 }}</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] started a programme of deregulation and [[privatisation]] after their victory at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. These included [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|express coach]] ([[Transport Act 1980]]), [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (completed in 1984), [[privatisation of London bus services]] (1984), [[bus deregulation in Great Britain|local bus services]] ([[Transport Act 1985]]) and [[privatisation of British Rail|the railways]] (1993). The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant. This act has often been criticised and called \"The abolition of Parliament Act\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[New Labour]] did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had already been privatised by the previous Conservative government. However, some government-owned businesses such as [[Qinetiq]] were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the [[public\u2013private partnership]], with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the [[National Health Service|NHS]], building new state schools, and maintaining the [[London Underground]]. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, instead being offered to commercial companies only.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Postal deregulation New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets.]]\n{{See also|Economy of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand Governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from 1984 to 1995.

The main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector (see [[RAO UES]]), with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Deregulation of the natural gas sector ([[Gazprom]]) is one of the more frequent demands placed upon Russia by the United States and European Union.\n\n=== United States ===\n\n==== History of regulation ====\n\nOne problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government [[regulation|regulatory agencies]], using them to serve the industries' interests. Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].  However, historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the Depression.\n\n==== Deregulation 1970\u20132000 ====\nDeregulation gained momentum in the 1970s, influenced by research by the [[Chicago school of economics]] and the theories of [[George Stigler]] and others.<ref>Sam Peltzman, \"The economic theory of regulation after a decade of deregulation.\" ''Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.

Two leading  'think tanks' in Washington, the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], were active in holding seminars and publishing studies advocating deregulatory initiatives throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Cornell economist [[Alfred E. Kahn]] played a central role in both theorizing and participating in the [[Carter Administration]]'s efforts to deregulate transportation.<ref>Alfred E. Kahn, \"Deregulation: looking backward and looking forward.\" ''Yale Journal on Regulation'' 7 (1990): pp. 325+ [http://users.uoa.gr/~gdellis/conf/Kahn-1990_Deregulation_looking_backward_and_forward.pdf online]</ref>\n\n==== Transportation ====\n\n===== Nixon administration =====\nThe first comprehensive proposal to deregulate a major industry in the United States, transportation, originated in the [[Richard Nixon]] Administration and was forwarded to Congress in late 1971.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|p=154}} This proposal was initiated and developed by an interagency group that included the Council of Economic Advisors (represented by [[Hendrik S. Houthakker|Hendrik Houthakker]] and Thomas Gale Moore<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Thomas Gale Moore\n | publisher = The Hoover Institution, Stanford University\n | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~moore/Bio.html\n | accessdate = 2012-06-11}}</ref>), White House Office of Consumer Affairs (represented by Jack Pearce), Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, Department of Labor, and other agencies.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|pp=152\u201360}}\n\nThe proposal addressed both rail and truck transportation, but not air carriage. (92d Congress, Senate Bill 2842)  The developers of this legislation in this Administration sought to cultivate support from commercial buyers of transportation services, consumer organizations, economists, and environmental organization leaders.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|pp=154\u201356}} This 'civil society' coalition became a template for coalitions influential in efforts to deregulate trucking and air transport later in the decade.\n\n===== Ford administration =====\nAfter Nixon left office, the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, with the allied interests, secured passage of the first significant change in regulatory policy in a pro-competitive direction, in the [[Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976]].\n\n===== Carter administration =====\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] devoted substantial effort to transportation deregulation, and worked with Congressional and civil society leaders to pass the  [[Airline Deregulation Act]] (October 24, 1978) -- the first federal government regulatory regime, since the 1930s, to be completely dismantled.<ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\">Brown, John Howard (assoc. prof., Dept of Finance & Economics, [[Georgia Southern University]]) (with credit to [[Alfred Kahn]], last CAB Chairman) [https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_19_01_06_brown.pdf \"Jimmy Carter, Alfred Kahn, and Airline Deregulation: Anatomy of a Policy Success,\"] Summer 2014, ''[[The Independent Review]],'' vol. 19, no. 1, ISSN 1086\u20131653, pp. 85\u201399</ref>\n\nCarter also worked with Congress to produce the [[Staggers Rail Act]] (signed October 14, 1980), and the [[Motor Carrier Act of 1980]] (signed July 1, 1980).\n\nThese were the major deregulation acts in transportation that set the general conceptual and legislative framework, which replaced the regulatory systems put in place between the 1880s and the 1930s. The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.\n\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of Milton Friedman led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\nThe ''[[Airline Deregulation Act]]'' is an example of a deregulatory act whose success has been questioned. Since deregulation, real prices for air travel has fallen by more than half, and travellers have more options; but there have been questions about disruptions, employee pensions and the lack of small city service.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/opinion/03iht-edpfaff.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2006 |title=Deregulation Gone Mad |last=Pfaff |first=William |location=Paris |accessdate=2009-08-17 }}</ref><ref>http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1998/4/airline2-98.pdf</ref>\n\n===== Energy =====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US. Regulation characteristics of Natural Gas Choice programs vary between the laws of the currently adoptive 21 states (as of 2008).\n\n{{anchor|U.S. electricity}} Deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began in 1992.

The rapid development of computer and communications technology&nbsp;\u2013 particularly the Internet&nbsp;\u2013 have increased the size and variety of communications offerings. Wireless, traditional landline telephone, and cable companies increasingly invade each other's traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n===== Finance =====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

It is the repeal of governmental [[Economic regulation|regulation of the economy]].  It became common in advanced industrial economies in the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of new trends in economic thinking about the inefficiencies of [[government regulation]], and the risk that regulatory agencies would be controlled by the regulated industry to its benefit, and thereby hurt consumers and the wider economy.\n\nEconomic regulations were promoted during the [[Gilded Age]], in which [[progressive era|progressive]] reforms were touted as necessary to limit [[externalities]] like corporate abuse, unsafe [[child labor]], [[monopolization]], [[pollution]], and to mitigate boom and bust cycles. Around the late 1970s, such reforms were deemed as burdensome on economic growth and many politicians espousing [[neoliberalism]] started promoting deregulation.\n\n[[File:France Telecom Wellington NZ.jpg|thumb|150px|As a result of deregulation, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] operates phone booths in Wellington, New Zealand.]]\nThe stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to raised levels of competitiveness, therefore higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], more efficiency and lower prices overall. Opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding [[pollution|environmental pollution]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90017-5|title=An ecological-economic assessment of deregulation of international commerce under GATT|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=9|pages=73\u201392|year=1994|last1=Daly|first1=Herman|last2=Goodland|first2=Robert}}</ref> and environmental quality standards (such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials), financial uncertainty, and [[Competition law|constraining monopolies]].\n\n[[Regulatory reform]] is a parallel development alongside deregulation. Regulatory reform refers to organized and ongoing programs to review regulations with a view to minimizing, simplifying, and making them more cost effective.  Such efforts, given impetus by the ''[[Regulatory Flexibility Act]]'' of 1980, are embodied in the United States Office of Management and Budget's [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], and the United Kingdom's [[Better Regulation Commission]]. [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis]] is frequently used in such reviews. In addition, there have been regulatory innovations, usually suggested by economists, such as [[emissions trading]].\n\nDeregulation can be distinguished from [[privatization]], where privatization can be seen as taking state-owned service providers into the private sector.\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[Argentina]] underwent heavy economic deregulation, [[privatization]], and had a [[fixed exchange rate]] during the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] administration (1989\u20131999).

This introduced now familiar requirements for \"regulatory impact statements\", but compliance by governmental agencies took many years. The labour market under the Hawke/Keating Labor governments operated under [[Prices and Incomes Accord|an accord]]. [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia]]  in 1996 [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|began deregulation]] of the labor market, subsequently taken much further in 2005  through their [[WorkChoices]] policy.

The other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers.   Customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company (LDC) or a deregulated supplier.   In most provinces the LDC is not allowed to offer a term contract, just a variable price based on the spot market.   LDC prices are changed either monthly or quarterly.\n\nThe province of [[Ontario]] began deregulation of electricity supply in 2002, but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility.<ref name=\"PIAC\"/> The government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework.\n\nThe current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation. The remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers.  However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision. Customers are free to choose which company they sign up with, but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition.   If they choose they may remain with the utility at the Regulated Rate Option.\n\nFormer Premier Ralph Klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the Enron model, and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous [[Enron#California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis|California electricity crisis]] (and the collapse of [[Enron scandal|Enron]] because of illegal accounting practices.)\n\n=== European Union ===\n* 2003 Corrections to EU directive about [[software patent]]s\n* Deregulation of the [[aircraft|air industry]] in Europe in 1992 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe taxi industry was deregulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] leading to an influx of new taxis.

These included [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|express coach]] ([[Transport Act 1980]]), [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (completed in 1984), [[privatisation of London bus services]] (1984), [[bus deregulation in Great Britain|local bus services]] ([[Transport Act 1985]]) and [[privatisation of British Rail|the railways]] (1993). The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant. This act has often been criticised and called \"The abolition of Parliament Act\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[New Labour]] did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had already been privatised by the previous Conservative government. However, some government-owned businesses such as [[Qinetiq]] were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the [[public\u2013private partnership]], with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the [[National Health Service|NHS]], building new state schools, and maintaining the [[London Underground]]. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, instead being offered to commercial companies only.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Postal deregulation New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets.]]\n{{See also|Economy of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand Governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from 1984 to 1995.

The policies had the goal of liberalising the economy and were notable for their very comprehensive coverage and innovations. Specific policies included: floating the exchange rate; establishing an independent reserve bank; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation.  Economic growth was resumed in 1991. New Zealand was changed from a somewhat closed and centrally controlled economy to one of the most open economies in the OECD.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v34y1996i4p1856-1902.html\n|title=Economic Reform in New Zealand 1984\u201395: The Pursuit of Efficiency\n|first=Lewis\n|last=Evans\n|first2= Arthur\n|last2= Grimes\n|first3= Bryce\n|last3= Wilkinson\n|journal= Journal of Economic Literature\n|volume= 34 | issue = 4\n|pages= 1856\u2013902\n|date=December 1996\n|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref> As a result, New Zealand, went from having a reputation as an almost socialist country to being considered one of the most business-friendly countries of the world, next to Singapore. However, critics charge that the deregulation has brought little benefit to some sections of society, and has caused much of New Zealand's economy (including almost all of the banks) to become foreign-owned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Russia ===\nRussia went through wide-ranging deregulation (and concomitant privatization) efforts in the late 1990s under [[Boris Yeltsin]], now partially reversed under [[Vladimir Putin]]. The main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector (see [[RAO UES]]), with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Deregulation of the natural gas sector ([[Gazprom]]) is one of the more frequent demands placed upon Russia by the United States and European Union.\n\n=== United States ===\n\n==== History of regulation ====\n\nOne problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government [[regulation|regulatory agencies]], using them to serve the industries' interests. Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].  However, historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the Depression.\n\n==== Deregulation 1970\u20132000 ====\nDeregulation gained momentum in the 1970s, influenced by research by the [[Chicago school of economics]] and the theories of [[George Stigler]] and others.<ref>Sam Peltzman, \"The economic theory of regulation after a decade of deregulation.\" ''Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.

Two leading  'think tanks' in Washington, the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], were active in holding seminars and publishing studies advocating deregulatory initiatives throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Cornell economist [[Alfred E. Kahn]] played a central role in both theorizing and participating in the [[Carter Administration]]'s efforts to deregulate transportation.<ref>Alfred E. Kahn, \"Deregulation: looking backward and looking forward.\" ''Yale Journal on Regulation'' 7 (1990): pp. 325+ [http://users.uoa.gr/~gdellis/conf/Kahn-1990_Deregulation_looking_backward_and_forward.pdf online]</ref>\n\n==== Transportation ====\n\nThe first comprehensive proposal to deregulate a major industry in the United States, transportation, originated in the [[Richard Nixon]] Administration and was forwarded to Congress in late 1971.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|p=154}} This proposal was initiated and developed by an interagency group that included the Council of Economic Advisors (represented by [[Hendrik S.

(92d Congress, Senate Bill 2842)  The developers of this legislation in this Administration sought to cultivate support from commercial buyers of transportation services, consumer organizations, economists, and environmental organization leaders.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|pp=154\u201356}} This 'civil society' coalition became a template for coalitions influential in efforts to deregulate trucking and air transport later in the decade.\n\nAfter Nixon left office, the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, with the allied interests, secured passage of the first significant change in regulatory policy in a pro-competitive direction, in the [[Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976]].\n\n===== Carter administration =====\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] devoted substantial effort to transportation deregulation, and worked with Congressional and civil society leaders to pass the  [[Airline Deregulation Act]] (October 24, 1978) -- the first federal government regulatory regime, since the 1930s, to be completely dismantled.<ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\">Brown, John Howard (assoc. prof., Dept of Finance & Economics, [[Georgia Southern University]]) (with credit to [[Alfred Kahn]], last CAB Chairman) [https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_19_01_06_brown.pdf \"Jimmy Carter, Alfred Kahn, and Airline Deregulation: Anatomy of a Policy Success,\"] Summer 2014, ''[[The Independent Review]],'' vol. 19, no. 1, ISSN 1086\u20131653, pp. 85\u201399</ref>\n\nCarter also worked with Congress to produce the [[Staggers Rail Act]] (signed October 14, 1980), and the [[Motor Carrier Act of 1980]] (signed July 1, 1980).\n\nThese were the major deregulation acts in transportation that set the general conceptual and legislative framework, which replaced the regulatory systems put in place between the 1880s and the 1930s. The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.\n\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of Milton Friedman led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\nThe ''[[Airline Deregulation Act]]'' is an example of a deregulatory act whose success has been questioned. Since deregulation, real prices for air travel has fallen by more than half, and travellers have more options; but there have been questions about disruptions, employee pensions and the lack of small city service.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/opinion/03iht-edpfaff.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2006 |title=Deregulation Gone Mad |last=Pfaff |first=William |location=Paris |accessdate=2009-08-17 }}</ref><ref>http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1998/4/airline2-98.pdf</ref>\n\n===== Energy =====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US. Regulation characteristics of Natural Gas Choice programs vary between the laws of the currently adoptive 21 states (as of 2008).\n\n{{anchor|U.S. electricity}} Deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began in 1992.

The rapid development of computer and communications technology&nbsp;\u2013 particularly the Internet&nbsp;\u2013 have increased the size and variety of communications offerings. Wireless, traditional landline telephone, and cable companies increasingly invade each other's traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n===== Finance =====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

As preceding sections of this article indicate, the movement was based on intellectual perspectives which prescribed substantial scope for market forces, and opposing perspectives have been in play in national and international discourse.\n\nThe movement toward greater reliance on market forces has been closely related to the growth of economic and institutional [[globalization]] between about 1950 and 2010.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nCritics of [[economic liberalisation]] and deregulation cite the benefits of regulation, and believe that certain regulations do not distort markets and allows companies to continue to be [[Competition (economics)|competitive]], or according to some, grow in competition.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\">Massimiliano Cali, Karen Ellis and Dirk Willem te Velde (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/2611.pdf The contribution of services to development: The role of regulation and trade liberalisation] London: Overseas Development Institute</ref> Much as the state plays an important role through issues such as [[property rights]], appropriate regulation is argued by some to be \"crucial to realise the benefits of service liberalisation\".<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\"/>\n\nCritics of deregulation often cite the need of regulation in order to:<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\"/>\n\n* create a level playing field and ensure [[Competition law|competition]] (e.g., by ensuring new energy providers have competitive access to the national grid);\n* maintain [[Quality management system|quality standards for services]] (e.g., by specifying qualification requirements for service providers);\n* [[Consumer protection|protect consumers]] (e.g. from fraud);\n* ensure sufficient provision of information (e.g., about the features of [[Comparison shopping website|competing services]]);\n* prevent [[environmental degradation]] (e.g., arising from high levels of tourist development);\n* guarantee wide [[Equity (economics)|access to services]] (e.g., ensuring poorer areas where profit margins are lower are also provided with electricity and health services); and,\n* prevent [[Financial crisis|financial instability]] and protect consumer savings from excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.\n\n=== For deregulation ===\nMany economists have concluded that a trend towards deregulation will increase economic welfare long-term and a sustainable free market system.
