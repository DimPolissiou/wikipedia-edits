She was a granddaughter of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and [[first cousin]] of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]].\n\nShe had a difficult childhood marked by illness and tantrums.  In 1863, while her father was Viceroy of Poland,  she was given away to be raised by her childless uncle and aunt, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl]] and [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Queen Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Vera's condition improved in their home and she outgrew her disruptive behavior. In 1871 she was legally adopted by Karl and Olga, who arranged her marriage in 1874 to [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1846\u20131877)]], a member of the Silesian ducal branch of the family. Her husband died suddenly three years later. Vera, only twenty-three years old, did not remarry, dedicating herself to her twin daughters. At the death of King Karl in 1891, Vera inherited a considerable fortune and she turned her home into a cultural gathering place. She was a popular figure in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], notable for her charitable work.\n\nGrand Duchess Vera was known in royal circles as an eccentric both in appearance and behavior. Although she kept in touch with her Romanov relatives, visiting Russia many times, she identified more closely with her adopted country. In 1909 she abandoned Orthodox Christianity and converted to [[Lutheranism]]. She died two years later after a stroke.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Queen Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg with her husband and their foster daughter.JPG|left|thumbnail|Grand Duchess Vera with her aunt, [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]] and uncle, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl of W\u00fcrttemberg, who raised her from the age of nine.]]]]\nGrand Duchess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia was born in [[St. Petersburg]] on 16 February 1854, the fourth child and second daughter of the six children of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia]] and his wife [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna]] (born Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg).\n\nGrand Duchess Vera spent her early years in St Petersburg and in 1861, the family moved to [[Warsaw]] when her father was appointed Viceroy of Poland.  Vera was a troubled child, prone to violent fits of anger, and suffered what was officially described as a \"nervous condition\".<ref name = \" King & Wilson 37\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 37</ref> She became so unmanageable that her parents decided to send her to her aunt, [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]], Queen of  [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], who agreed to take care of her. On 7 December 1863, Grand Duke Constantin and his wife arrived with nine-year-old Vera in [[Stuttgart]], entrusting her care to the childless [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and Queen Olga. Officially this was ascribed to the more advanced medical treatment the child would receive in Germany, but it was also a way for Vera's parents to hide her embarrassing illness from the Russian court.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/> Queen Olga was happy to take care of her niece in spite of the difficulties, and for Vera, her aunt eventually took the place of her mother.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/>\n\nQueen Olga and her husband were devoted foster parents, but in the beginning, they had little success in improving the girl's condition. Vera was homesick and continued to be extremely difficult, to the point of being physically violent towards them. Periodically, Vera had to be brought under control by an army officer, and on more than one occasion she was locked up.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/> Karl went for long walks with Vera and read passages from the Bible to her in the evening. By 1866, there was still little improvement in Vera's condition, but Queen Olga persevered and with time, Grand Duchess Vera eventually outgrew her disruptive behavior.\n\nAs a young woman, she was introspective, shy, but clever with an intellectual bent. She disliked ceremony. Her physical appearance, like her personality, was rather peculiar. She had thick, curly blonde hair, but was short, stumpy and extremely plain.\n<ref name = \" George, Grand Duchess of Russia 55\">George, Grand Duchess of Russia ,'' A Romanov Diary'' , p. 55</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Vera and Wilhelm Eugen.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Grand Duchess Vera with her husband, Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg. 1874.]]\n\nKing Karl and Queen Olga legally adopted Grand Duchess Vera in 1871. They arranged her marriage to a member of the Silesian branch of their family, [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1846\u20131877)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (b. 20 August 1846 \u2013 27 January 1877), as in this way she would not have to leave the country after her marriage. The couple were distant cousins, as Vera was a great-great granddaughter of [[Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] twice over; on her father's side and on her mother's.\n\nThe engagement took place in January 1874, pleasing both families. Grand Duke Konstantine wrote to the King and Queen profusely thanking them for the help they had given to his daughter. Queen Olga wrote to her friend Marie von Kinderlen-Waechter, \"My problem child is now a happy bride, loving and beloved.  I never dreamed that such happiness could exist. Eugen is already like a son to the King.  I fold my hands and thank God day and night for such a blessing\".<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\">Be\u00e9che, ''The Grand Duchesses'', p. 70.</ref>  Even the heir to the W\u00fcrttemberg throne, [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|Prince William]], wrote that Vera was the luckiest bride in the world.  \"While she is very ugly and will always remain so, compared to how she was as a child she is unbelievably improved.  I consider her not to be without accomplishments, and, I believe, not without heart.\" <ref name = \" Jena 316\">Jena , ''Koenigin Olga von Wuerttemberg'', p. 316</ref>\n\nVera was nineteen and Eugen twenty-eight. The wedding was celebrated with great pomp in [[Stuttgart]] on 4 May 1874 in the presence of Vera's uncle, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who, noticing the unattractiveness of his niece, remarked ungallantly, \"I confess that I do not envy the young husband\".<ref name = \" King & Wilson 38\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 38</ref>  He did, however, arrange for Vera's father to settle a million rubles on her as a dowry.\n[[File:Grand Duchess Vera with her son Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg.JPG|thumb|150px|Grand Duchess Vera with her son Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg.]]\nThe couple settled in a large house, the \"Akademie\" in Stuttgart. The following year, Vera gave birth to a son, Karl Eugen, who died only seven months later. In 1876, Vera had twin daughters, Elsa and Olga.\n\nHowever, the Grand Duchess' married life was to be short-lived. Her husband, an officer in the W\u00fcrttemberg army, took charge of a command in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he died unexpectedly on 27 January 1877.  The cause of death was officially given as, alternately, a fall from a horse, and a respiratory illness. However, many believed the Duke, a well-known ''bon vivant'', had actually been killed in a duel, which was hushed up.  The marriage had lasted three years.  Only twenty-three years old, Vera never married again. She reacted to the death of her husband in practical, not grief-stricken terms.<ref name = \" Jena 320-322\">Jena , ''Koenigin Olga von Wuerttemberg'', p. 320-322</ref>\n\nRather than returning to her native country, the young widow decided to stay in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], the country she felt to be her own, where she had the protection of the King. However, she traveled frequently to visit her relatives in Russia as well as her only sister, [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of the Hellenes]], in Greece.\n\nAt the death of King Karl in 1891, Vera inherited a considerable fortune, and when Queen Olga died a year later, she received Villa Berg in [[Stuttgart]], where she lived in considerable style. She also wrote poetry, and her home was the scene of many cultural as well as family gatherings\n\nBright and talkative, Grand Duchess Vera was popular in W\u00fcrttemberg, where she dedicated herself to charitable work. Refuges for fallen women, called \"Vera's Homes\"; the Benevolent Institution; the Olga Clinic in Stuttgart; the Nicholas nursing station for the blind, the Mariaberg Institute near Reutlingen, the dragoon regiment of her late husband, and a Russian regiment, were among the more than thirty institutions and organizations under her patronage. She was also involved in the construction of the Orthodox Church of St Nicholas in Stuttgart.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Grand Duchess Vera with her daughters.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna with her daughters, Elsa (in the middle) and Olga]]\nGrand Duchess Vera visited Russia often and was present with her daughters in May 1896 during the coronation  ceremonies of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The elder of the twins, Elsa, was first engaged in January 1895 to Hereditary  Prince [[Prince Alfred of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Alfred of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], a grandson of [[Queen Victoria]]. The engagement was quickly broken off, and Elsa married a distant cousin, Prince Albert of Schaumburg-Lippe, brother of [[Charlotte of Schaumburg-Lippe|Queen Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The following year, Vera's other daughter, Olga, married her brother-in-law's younger brother, Prince Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe.  Olga's fate was similar to Vera's; she had three children and within a few years of her marriage, she lost a child and her husband, becoming a widow at an early age and never marrying again.\n\nAged beyond her years, Grand Duchess Vera was now in poor health. Some authorities now speculate that she suffered from [[Chorea (disease)|Sydenham's chorea]] or Saint Vitus Dance, a neurological movement disorder characterized by abrupt, involuntary movements.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>  In Stuttgart Vera was assigned an officer to follow her about, to make sure that if she had an attack she would not fall and injure herself.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>\n\nBy the turn of the century, Vera Constantinova appeared small and dumpy with a fat, round face.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 105\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 105</ref> She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  71\">Be\u00e9che, ''The Grand Duchesses'', p. 71.</ref>   Extremely nearsighted, she wore a [[pince-nez]]. She was considered rather eccentric, but she had a good sense of humor and her funny remarks were remembered by her nephews and nieces. She was well liked by her family.\n[[File:Vera Konstantinovna with her daughters, Elsa right Olga left and Grand children.jpg|thumb|280px|Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia (center) with her daughters, Olga (left), Elsa (right) and grandchildren.]]\nAfter living in W\u00fcrttemberg for so long, she was at odds politically and religiously with her Russian relatives. Her political sympathies lay with Germany and she did not share the increasingly anti-German view of the Romanovs. Vera Konstantinovna was very religious, but had never understood the Orthodox faith and eventually abandoned it to convert to [[Lutheranism]] in 1909, to the consternation of the Romanov family. She then commissioned the building of a Protestant church on the grounds of Villa Berg.\n\nIn 1903, during the wedding dinner for Princess [[Alice of Battenberg]] to her nephew Prince [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Andrew of Greece]] in [[Darmstadt]], Prince [[Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark|Christopher]] recalled \"My brother [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]] sat next to her, and at a pause in the proceedings, snatched off her tiara and put it on his own head. Everybody laughed, Aunt Vera included, although she vowed vengeance on the culprit. Her turn came, as she thought, a little later, when the bride and bridegroom started on their honeymoon. We were all gathered at the door, throwing rice at them, when someone knocked off poor Aunt Vera's glasses, which were smashed to atoms on the stone steps.\" <ref name=\" King & Wilson 105\"/> An unfortunate man who happened to be standing next to the Grand Duchess, then became the object of her wrath. She knocked the man's hat off and began to hit him over the head with it.\n\nGrand Duchess Vera Constantinovna suffered a stroke in October 1911. She had a slow recovery and she died in [[Stuttgart]] on 11 April 1912 of an acute renal failure, aged fifty-eight.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 105\"/> She was deeply mourned as she was the most popular princess of the Royal house of W\u00fcrttemberg.<ref>http://www.landesarchiv-bw.de/web/54116</ref>\n\n==Children==\nGrand Duchess Vera and her husband Duke Eugene of W\u00fcrttemberg had three children:\n\n*Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (8 April 1875 \u2013 11 November 1875).\n*[[Duchess Elsa of W\u00fcrttemberg|Elsa of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1 March 1876 \u2013 27 May 1936) m. 1897 Albrecht of Schaumburg-Lippe (24 October 1869 \u2013 25 December 1942).\n**Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe (28 March 1898 \u2013 4 February 1974)\n**Franz Josef of Schaumburg-Lippe (1 September 1899 \u2013 6 July 1963)\n**Alexander of Schaumburg-Lippe (20 January 1901 \u2013 26 November 1923)\n**Bathildis of Schaumburg-Lippe (11 November 1903 \u2013 29 June 1983)\n*[[Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1 March 1876 \u2013 21 October 1932) m. 1898 Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe (13 March 1871 \u2013 1 April 1904).\n**[[Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe|Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe]] (8 August 1899 \u2013 9 November 1929)\n**Albrecht of Schaumburg-Lippe (17 October 1900 \u2013 20 May 1984)\n**Bernhard of Schaumburg-Lippe (8 December 1902 \u2013 24 June 1903)\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

She was a granddaughter of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and [[first cousin]] of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]].\n\nShe had a difficult childhood marked by illness and tantrums.  In 1863, while her father was Viceroy of Poland,  she was given away to be raised by her childless uncle and aunt, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl]] and [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Queen Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Vera's condition improved in their home and she outgrew her disruptive behavior. In 1871 she was legally adopted by Karl and Olga, who arranged her marriage in 1874 to [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1846\u20131877)]], a member of the Silesian ducal branch of the family. Her husband died suddenly three years later. Vera, only twenty-three years old, did not remarry, dedicating herself to her twin daughters. At the death of King Karl in 1891, Vera inherited a considerable fortune and she turned her home into a cultural gathering place. She was a popular figure in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], notable for her charitable work.\n\nGrand Duchess Vera was known in royal circles as an eccentric both in appearance and behavior. Although she kept in touch with her Romanov relatives, visiting Russia many times, she identified more closely with her adopted country. In 1909 she abandoned Orthodox Christianity and converted to [[Lutheranism]]. She died two years later after a stroke.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Queen Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg with her husband and their foster daughter.JPG|left|thumbnail|Grand Duchess Vera with her aunt, [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]] and uncle, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl of W\u00fcrttemberg, who raised her from the age of nine.]]]]\nGrand Duchess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia was born in [[St. Petersburg]] on 16 February 1854, the fourth child and second daughter of the six children of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia]] and his wife [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna]] (born Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg).\n\nGrand Duchess Vera spent her early years in St Petersburg and in 1861, the family moved to [[Warsaw]] when her father was appointed Viceroy of Poland.  Vera was a troubled child, prone to violent fits of anger, and suffered what was officially described as a \"nervous condition\".<ref name = \" King & Wilson 37\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 37</ref> She became so unmanageable that her parents decided to send her to her aunt, [[Olga Nicholaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]], Queen of  [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], who agreed to take care of her. On 7 December 1863, Grand Duke Constantin and his wife arrived with nine-year-old Vera in [[Stuttgart]], entrusting her care to the childless [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|King Karl of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and Queen Olga. Officially this was ascribed to the more advanced medical treatment the child would receive in Germany, but it was also a way for Vera's parents to hide her embarrassing illness from the Russian court.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/> Queen Olga was happy to take care of her niece in spite of the difficulties, and for Vera, her aunt eventually took the place of her mother.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/>\n\nQueen Olga and her husband were devoted foster parents, but in the beginning, they had little success in improving the girl's condition. Vera was homesick and continued to be extremely difficult, to the point of being physically violent towards them. Periodically, Vera had to be brought under control by an army officer, and on more than one occasion she was locked up.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 37\"/> Karl went for long walks with Vera and read passages from the Bible to her in the evening. By 1866, there was still little improvement in Vera's condition, but Queen Olga persevered and with time, Grand Duchess Vera eventually outgrew her disruptive behavior.\n\nAs a young woman, she was introspective, shy, but clever with an intellectual bent. She disliked ceremony. Her physical appearance, like her personality, was rather peculiar. She had thick, curly blonde hair, but was short, stumpy and extremely plain.\n<ref name = \" George, Grand Duchess of Russia 55\">George, Grand Duchess of Russia ,'' A Romanov Diary'' , p. 55</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Vera and Wilhelm Eugen.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Grand Duchess Vera with her husband, Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg. 1874.]]\n\nKing Karl and Queen Olga legally adopted Grand Duchess Vera in 1871. They arranged her marriage to a member of the Silesian branch of their family, [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1846\u20131877)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (b. 20 August 1846 \u2013 27 January 1877), as in this way she would not have to leave the country after her marriage. The couple were distant cousins, as Vera was a great-great granddaughter of [[Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] twice over; on her father's side and on her mother's.\n\nThe engagement took place in January 1874, pleasing both families. Grand Duke Konstantine wrote to the King and Queen profusely thanking them for the help they had given to his daughter. Queen Olga wrote to her friend Marie von Kinderlen-Waechter, \"My problem child is now a happy bride, loving and beloved.  I never dreamed that such happiness could exist. Eugen is already like a son to the King.  I fold my hands and thank God day and night for such a blessing\".<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\">Be\u00e9che, ''The Grand Duchesses'', p. 70.</ref>  Even the heir to the W\u00fcrttemberg throne, [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|Prince William]], wrote that Vera was the luckiest bride in the world.  \"While she is very ugly and will always remain so, compared to how she was as a child she is unbelievably improved.  I consider her not to be without accomplishments, and, I believe, not without heart.\" <ref name = \" Jena 316\">Jena , ''Koenigin Olga von Wuerttemberg'', p. 316</ref>\n\nVera was nineteen and Eugen twenty-eight. The wedding was celebrated with great pomp in [[Stuttgart]] on 4 May 1874 in the presence of Vera's uncle, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who, noticing the unattractiveness of his niece, remarked ungallantly, \"I confess that I do not envy the young husband\".<ref name = \" King & Wilson 38\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 38</ref>  He did, however, arrange for Vera's father to settle a million rubles on her as a dowry.\n[[File:Grand Duchess Vera with her son Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg.JPG|thumb|150px|Grand Duchess Vera with her son Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg.]]\nThe couple settled in a large house, the \"Akademie\" in Stuttgart. The following year, Vera gave birth to a son, Karl Eugen, who died only seven months later. In 1876, Vera had twin daughters, Elsa and Olga.\n\nHowever, the Grand Duchess' married life was to be short-lived. Her husband, an officer in the W\u00fcrttemberg army, took charge of a command in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he died unexpectedly on 27 January 1877.  The cause of death was officially given as, alternately, a fall from a horse, and a respiratory illness. However, many believed the Duke, a well-known ''bon vivant'', had actually been killed in a duel, which was hushed up.  The marriage had lasted three years.  Only twenty-three years old, Vera never married again. She reacted to the death of her husband in practical, not grief-stricken terms.<ref name = \" Jena 320-322\">Jena , ''Koenigin Olga von Wuerttemberg'', p. 320-322</ref>\n\nRather than returning to her native country, the young widow decided to stay in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], the country she felt to be her own, where she had the protection of the King. However, she traveled frequently to visit her relatives in Russia as well as her only sister, [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of the Hellenes]], in Greece.\n\nAt the death of King Karl in 1891, Vera inherited a considerable fortune, and when Queen Olga died a year later, she received Villa Berg in [[Stuttgart]], where she lived in considerable style. She also wrote poetry, and her home was the scene of many cultural as well as family gatherings\n\nBright and talkative, Grand Duchess Vera was popular in W\u00fcrttemberg, where she dedicated herself to charitable work. Refuges for fallen women, called \"Vera's Homes\"; the Benevolent Institution; the Olga Clinic in Stuttgart; the Nicholas nursing station for the blind, the Mariaberg Institute near Reutlingen, the dragoon regiment of her late husband, and a Russian regiment, were among the more than thirty institutions and organizations under her patronage. She was also involved in the construction of the Orthodox Church of St Nicholas in Stuttgart.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Grand Duchess Vera with her daughters.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna with her daughters, Elsa (in the middle) and Olga]]\nGrand Duchess Vera visited Russia often and was present with her daughters in May 1896 during the coronation  ceremonies of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The elder of the twins, Elsa, was first engaged in January 1895 to Hereditary  Prince [[Prince Alfred of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Alfred of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], a grandson of [[Queen Victoria]]. The engagement was quickly broken off, and Elsa married a distant cousin, Prince Albert of Schaumburg-Lippe, brother of [[Charlotte of Schaumburg-Lippe|Queen Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The following year, Vera's other daughter, Olga, married her brother-in-law's younger brother, Prince Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe.  Olga's fate was similar to Vera's; she had three children and within a few years of her marriage, she lost a child and her husband, becoming a widow at an early age and never marrying again.\n\nAged beyond her years, Grand Duchess Vera was now in poor health. Some authorities now speculate that she suffered from [[Chorea (disease)|Sydenham's chorea]] or Saint Vitus Dance, a neurological movement disorder characterized by abrupt, involuntary movements.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>  In Stuttgart Vera was assigned an officer to follow her about, to make sure that if she had an attack she would not fall and injure herself.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  70\"/>\n\nBy the turn of the century, Vera Constantinova appeared small and dumpy with a fat, round face.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 105\">King & Wilson , ''Gilded Prism'', p. 105</ref> She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che  71\">Be\u00e9che, ''The Grand Duchesses'', p. 71.</ref>   Extremely nearsighted, she wore a [[pince-nez]]. She was considered rather eccentric, but she had a good sense of humor and her funny remarks were remembered by her nephews and nieces. She was well liked by her family.\n[[File:Vera Konstantinovna with her daughters, Elsa right Olga left and Grand children.jpg|thumb|280px|Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia (center) with her daughters, Olga (left), Elsa (right) and grandchildren.]]\nAfter living in W\u00fcrttemberg for so long, she was at odds politically and religiously with her Russian relatives. Her political sympathies lay with Germany and she did not share the increasingly anti-German view of the Romanovs. Vera Konstantinovna was very religious, but had never understood the Orthodox faith and eventually abandoned it to convert to [[Lutheranism]] in 1909, to the consternation of the Romanov family. She then commissioned the building of a Protestant church on the grounds of Villa Berg.\n\nIn 1903, during the wedding dinner for Princess [[Alice of Battenberg]] to her nephew Prince [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Andrew of Greece]] in [[Darmstadt]], Prince [[Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark|Christopher]] recalled \"My brother [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]] sat next to her, and at a pause in the proceedings, snatched off her tiara and put it on his own head. Everybody laughed, Aunt Vera included, although she vowed vengeance on the culprit. Her turn came, as she thought, a little later, when the bride and bridegroom started on their honeymoon. We were all gathered at the door, throwing rice at them, when someone knocked off poor Aunt Vera's glasses, which were smashed to atoms on the stone steps.\" <ref name=\" King & Wilson 105\"/> An unfortunate man who happened to be standing next to the Grand Duchess, then became the object of her wrath. She knocked the man's hat off and began to hit him over the head with it.\n\nGrand Duchess Vera Constantinovna suffered a stroke in October 1911. She had a slow recovery and she died in [[Stuttgart]] on 11 April 1912 of an acute renal failure, aged fifty-eight.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 105\"/> She was deeply mourned as she was the most popular princess of the Royal house of W\u00fcrttemberg.<ref>http://www.landesarchiv-bw.de/web/54116</ref>\n\n==Children==\nGrand Duchess Vera and her husband Duke Eugene of W\u00fcrttemberg had three children:\n\n*Charles-Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (8 April 1875 \u2013 11 November 1875).\n*[[Duchess Elsa of W\u00fcrttemberg|Elsa of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1 March 1876 \u2013 27 May 1936) m. 1897 Albrecht of Schaumburg-Lippe (24 October 1869 \u2013 25 December 1942).\n**Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe (28 March 1898 \u2013 4 February 1974)\n**Franz Josef of Schaumburg-Lippe (1 September 1899 \u2013 6 July 1963)\n**Alexander of Schaumburg-Lippe (20 January 1901 \u2013 26 November 1923)\n**Bathildis of Schaumburg-Lippe (11 November 1903 \u2013 29 June 1983)\n*[[Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1 March 1876 \u2013 21 October 1932) m. 1898 Maximilian of Schaumburg-Lippe (13 March 1871 \u2013 1 April 1904).\n**[[Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe|Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe]] (8 August 1899 \u2013 9 November 1929)\n**Albrecht of Schaumburg-Lippe (17 October 1900 \u2013 20 May 1984)\n**Bernhard of Schaumburg-Lippe (8 December 1902 \u2013 24 June 1903)\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
