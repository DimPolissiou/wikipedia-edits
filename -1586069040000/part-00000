{"title_page": "Partimento", "text_new": "A '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Pedagogical Characteristics ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b, d g>2 <a d fis> <b d g>1\t\t \n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <3>2 <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Compound Cadence ===\nA compound cadence is when, above \u2464, one makes a dissonance of a 4th prepared by the 8ve of \u2460 and resolved to the major 3rd of \u2464.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              << { g2~ g4 fis }  \\\\ { d2 d }  \\\\ \\\\ { s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a2 } \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b2 >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>2 <5 4>4 <_+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Double Cadence ===\nA double cadence is when, above \u2464, one puts the major 3rd and 5th, the 6th and 4th, the 4th and 5th, and then the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n== Rule of the Octave ==\n\nAfter learning cadences, students at the Neapolitan conservatories were immediately taught the Rule of the Octave. The most prominent form of the Rule of the Octave would be the one by Fedele Fenaroli. {{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=114}}\n\n=== Essential Foundations of the Key  ===\n\n=== Major mode ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <c d fis> <b d g> <a e' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <b d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g, a b c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3 5 8> <6 3> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G major.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <b d g> <c d fis> <b d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g fis e d c b a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G major.\n\n=== Minor mode ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <c d fis> <bes d g> <a es' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <bes d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g, a bes c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3+ 8 5> <3 6> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G minor.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <bes d g> <c d fis> <bes d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g f es d c bes a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3+ 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G minor.\n\n== Suspensions ==\n\n=== The Fourth ===\n\n=== The Seventh ===\n\n=== The Ninth ===\n\n=== Bass Suspension: The Second ===\n\n== Bass Motions ==\n\n== Dimunition ==\n\n== Imitation ==\n\n== Partimento Fugues ==\nThe culmination of partimento training is the realization of partimento fugues.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=122}}\n\n== Partimento and Counterpoint ==\nPartimenti were also used as bass lines in written counterpoint exercises, over which students wrote two-, three, and four-part \u201cdisposizione\u201d (multistave settings).\n\n== Notable collections of Partimenti ==\nNotable partimento collections were written by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Francesco Durante]], [[Leonardo Leo]], [[Fedele Fenaroli]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Nicola Sala]], [[Giacomo Tritto]], [[Stanislao Mattei]], and [[Luigi Palmerini]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{citation |last=Fenaroli |title=Regole Musicali Per i Principianti Di Cembalo |publisher=Naples, Vincenzo Mazzola-Vocola. |year=1775}}\n* {{citation |last=Sanguinetti |title=Decline and fall of the \"Celeste Impero\": the thoery of composition in Naples during the ottocento |publisher=Studi musicali, Anno XXXIV - n.2, p. 451-502. |year=2005}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Images of Galant Music in Neapolitan Partimenti and Solfeggi |publisher=Improvisatorische Praxis vom Mittelalter bis zum 18.

Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Pedagogical Characteristics ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b, d g>2 <a d fis> <b d g>1\t\t \n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <3>2 <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Compound Cadence ===\nA compound cadence is when, above \u2464, one makes a dissonance of a 4th prepared by the 8ve of \u2460 and resolved to the major 3rd of \u2464.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              << { g2~ g4 fis }  \\\\ { d2 d }  \\\\ \\\\ { s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a2 } \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b2 >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>2 <5 4>4 <_+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Double Cadence ===\nA double cadence is when, above \u2464, one puts the major 3rd and 5th, the 6th and 4th, the 4th and 5th, and then the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n== Rule of the Octave ==\n\nAfter learning cadences, students at the Neapolitan conservatories were immediately taught the Rule of the Octave. The most prominent form of the Rule of the Octave would be the one by Fedele Fenaroli. {{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=114}}\n\n=== Essential Foundations of the Key  ===\n\n=== Major mode ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <c d fis> <b d g> <a e' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <b d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g, a b c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3 5 8> <6 3> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G major.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <b d g> <c d fis> <b d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g fis e d c b a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G major.\n\n=== Minor mode ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <c d fis> <bes d g> <a es' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <bes d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g, a bes c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3+ 8 5> <3 6> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G minor.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <bes d g> <c d fis> <bes d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g f es d c bes a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3+ 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G minor.\n\n== Suspensions ==\n\n=== The Fourth ===\n\n=== The Seventh ===\n\n=== The Ninth ===\n\n=== Bass Suspension: The Second ===\n\n== Bass Motions ==\n\n== Dimunition ==\n\n== Imitation ==\n\n== Partimento Fugues ==\nThe culmination of partimento training is the realization of partimento fugues.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=122}}\n\n== Partimento and Counterpoint ==\nPartimenti were also used as bass lines in written counterpoint exercises, over which students wrote two-, three, and four-part \u201cdisposizione\u201d (multistave settings).\n\n== Notable collections of Partimenti ==\nNotable partimento collections were written by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Francesco Durante]], [[Leonardo Leo]], [[Fedele Fenaroli]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Nicola Sala]], [[Giacomo Tritto]], [[Stanislao Mattei]], and [[Luigi Palmerini]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{citation |last=Fenaroli |title=Regole Musicali Per i Principianti Di Cembalo |publisher=Naples, Vincenzo Mazzola-Vocola. |year=1775}}\n* {{citation |last=Sanguinetti |title=Decline and fall of the \"Celeste Impero\": the thoery of composition in Naples during the ottocento |publisher=Studi musicali, Anno XXXIV - n.2, p. 451-502. |year=2005}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Images of Galant Music in Neapolitan Partimenti and Solfeggi |publisher=Improvisatorische Praxis vom Mittelalter bis zum 18.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.
