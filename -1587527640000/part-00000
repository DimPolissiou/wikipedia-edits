The specifics depend on the type of hormone. Some tumors secrete more than one hormone, the most common combination{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} being [[growth hormone|GH]] and [[prolactin]], which present as [[Acromegaly|unexpected bone growth]] and unexpected [[lactation]] (in both men and women).\n\nA patient with pituitary adenoma may present with [[visual field]] defects, classically [[bitemporal hemianopsia]]. It arises from the compression of the [[optic nerve]] by the tumor. The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the [[optic chiasma]].\n\nThe anatomy of this structure causes pressure on it to produce a defect in the temporal visual field on both sides, a condition called [[bitemporal hemianopsia]]. If originating superior to the [[optic chiasm]], more commonly in a [[craniopharyngioma]] of the [[pituitary stalk]], the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia]], if originating inferior to the [[optic chiasm]] the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal superior quadrantanopia]]. Lateral expansion of a pituitary adenoma can also compress the [[abducens nerve]], causing a [[lateral rectus]] palsy.\n\nAlso, a pituitary adenoma can cause symptoms of [[Intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|increased intracranial pressure]].\n\nProlactinomas often start to give symptoms especially during pregnancy, when the [[hormone]] [[progesterone]] increases the tumor's growth rate.\n\nVarious types of headaches are common in patients with pituitary adenomas. The adenoma may be the prime causative factor behind the headache or may serve to exacerbate a headache caused by other factors.

It arises from the compression of the [[optic nerve]] by the tumor. The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the [[optic chiasma]].\n\nThe anatomy of this structure causes pressure on it to produce a defect in the temporal visual field on both sides, a condition called [[bitemporal hemianopsia]]. If originating superior to the [[optic chiasm]], more commonly in a [[craniopharyngioma]] of the [[pituitary stalk]], the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia]], if originating inferior to the [[optic chiasm]] the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal superior quadrantanopia]]. Lateral expansion of a pituitary adenoma can also compress the [[abducens nerve]], causing a [[lateral rectus]] palsy.\n\nAlso, a pituitary adenoma can cause symptoms of [[Intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|increased intracranial pressure]].\n\nProlactinomas often start to give symptoms especially during pregnancy, when the [[hormone]] [[progesterone]] increases the tumor's growth rate.\n\nVarious types of headaches are common in patients with pituitary adenomas.

{"title_page": "Crusade song", "text_new": "A '''Crusade song''' ({{lang-oc|canson de crozada}}, {{lang-ca|can\u00e7\u00f3 de croada}}, {{lang-de|Kreuzlied}}) is any [[vernacular]] [[lyric poem]] about the [[Crusades]]. Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905).

Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905).

His father, George Emmanuel Tatischeff, born in 1875 in Paris (d. 1957), was the son of Dmitry Tatishchev (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0432), General of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and [[military attach\u00e9]] to the Russian Embassy in Paris. The Tatischeffs (also spelled Tatishchev) were a Russian noble family of patrilineal [[Rurikid]] descent.  Whilst stationed in Paris Dmitri Tatischeff married a French woman, Rose Anathalie Alinquant. (Russian sources indicate that she was a circus performer and that they never married.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russian.rfi.fr/kultura/20110220-multfilm-illyuzionist-i-docheri-zhaka-tati|title=\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 - \u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \"\u0418\u043b\u043b\u044e\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\" \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0416\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0438|date=20 February 2011|website=rfi.fr|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nUnder suspicious circumstances Dmitri Tatischeff died from injuries sustained in a horse-riding accident shortly after the birth of George Emmanuel. As a child George Emmanuel experienced turbulent times, such as being forcibly removed from France and taken to Russia to live. In 1883 his mother brought him back to France where they settled on the estate of [[Le Pecq]], near [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] on the outskirts of Paris.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=1}}, \" Une famille bien fran\u00e7aise : les Tatischeff \"</ref> In 1903, Georges-Emmanuel Tatischeff married the Dutch-Italian Marcelle Claire van Hoof (d. 1968).

Subsequently, Georges-Emmanuel became the director of the company Cadres Van Hoof, and the Tatischeff family enjoyed a relatively high standard of living.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=2}}, \"Les Cadres Van Hoof\".</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJacques Tatischeff appears to have been an indifferent student, yet excelled in the sports of tennis and horse riding. He left school in 1923 at the age of 16 to take up an apprenticeship in the family business, where he was trained as a picture framer by his grandfather. Between 1927 and 1928 he completed his military national service at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] with the Cavalry's 16th Regiment of Dragoons.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=3}}, \"Le dragon\".</ref> Upon graduating the military he took on an apprenticeship in London where he was first introduced to the sport of [[Rugby football|rugby]]. Returning to Paris, he joined the semi-professional rugby team Racing Club de France, whose captain was [[Alfred Sauvy]] and whose supporters included [[Tristan Bernard]]. It was at the Racing Club de France that Jacques Tatischeff first discovered his comic talents, entertaining his teammates during intervals with hilarious impersonations of their sporting endeavours. He also first met [[Jacques Broido]], and they would become lifelong friends.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=4}}, \"Dr\u00f4le d'\u00e9cole\".</ref>\n\nBetween 1931 and 1932 the [[Great Depression in France|global economic crisis reached France]]<ref>Il a conserv\u00e9 le statut et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d'apprenti, n'ayant pas r\u00e9ussi l'examen pour devenir ouvrier.</ref> at the same time he left both the Racing Club de France and, to his family's disapproval, his apprenticeship at Cadres Van Hoof. Giving up a relatively comfortable middle-class lifestyle for one of a struggling performing artist during this difficult economic time, he developed a collection of highly physical mimes that would become his ''Impressions Sportives'' (''Sporting Impressions''). Each year from 1931 to 1934 he would participate in an amateur show organised by Alfred Sauvy.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|p=56 et 57}} : affiches pour 1931 (''Sport muet par Jacques Tattischeff'') et 1933, o\u00f9 il est cit\u00e9 en haut de l'affiche : ''J. Taticheff''.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Kabarett der Komiker; Jacques Tati 013575c.jpg|thumb|right|Tati in Germany, 1938.]]\n===Early work===\nAlthough he had likely played music hall engagements before, his act was first mentioned in 1935, when he performed at the gala for the newspaper ''[[Le Journal]]'' to celebrate the French victory in the competition to set the transatlantic crossing record from [[Normandy]]. Among the honourable spectators was the influential writer [[Colette]]. Tati's act also caught the attention of [[Max Trebor]], who offered him an engagement at the Theatre-Michel, where he quickly became the star act. After his success there, Tati tried to make it in London, playing a short season at the [[Finsbury Park Empire]] in March 1936. Upon his return to Paris in the same year, he was immediately hired as top billing at the ABC Th\u00e9\u00e2tre<ref name=ABC>[[:fr:ABC (music-hall)|ABC_(music-hall)]] French Wikipedia for l'ABC</ref> alongside the singer [[Marie Dubas]], where he would work uninterrupted until the outbreak of the Second World War.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=6, 8, 10}}.</ref> It was for Tati's performances of his now finely tuned ''Impressions Sportives'' at the ABC that the previously impressed Colette wrote,\n\n<blockquote>\"From now on no celebration, no artistic or acrobatic spectacle can do without this amazing performer, who has invented something quite his own...His act is partly ballet and partly sport, partly satire and partly a charade. He has devised a way of being both the player, the ball and the tennis racquet, of being simultaneously the football and the goalkeeper, the boxer and his opponent, the bicycle and the cyclist. Without any props, he conjures up his accessories and his partners. He has suggestive powers of all great artists. How gratifying it was to see the audience's warm reaction! Tati's success says a lot about the sophistication of the allegedly \"uncouth\" public, about its taste for novelty and its appreciation of style. Jacques Tati, the horse and rider conjured, will show all of Paris the living image of that legendary creature, the centaur.\"<ref>Colette, \"Spectacles de Paris\", '''Le Journal''', 28 June 1936, quoted in {{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=63}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the 1930s he also performed at the [[Scala (Berlin)|Scala]] in Berlin between 1937 and 1938, and began to experiment with film acting in the following shorts:\n\n*1932: ''Oscar, champion de tennis'' directed by [[Jack Forrester (director)|Jack Forrester]] written by and starring Jacques Tati (film lost);\n*1934: ''On demande une brute'' directed by [[Charles Barrois (b.1890)|Charles Barrois]], with Jacques Tati as (''Roger''), Enrico Sprocani as ''le clown Rhum'' (''Enrico'');\n*1935: ''[[Gai dimanche]]'' directed by [[Jacques Berr]], wrote and starring Jacques Tati and Enrico Sprocani; and\n*1936: ''Soigne ton gauche'' directed by [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], starring Jacques Tati (''Roger''), Jacques Broido (''sparring partner''), Max Martel (''the postman'').\n\n===World War II===\nIn September 1939 Tati was conscripted back into his 16th Regiment of Dragoons which was then incorporated into the [[3rd Division Legere de Cavalerie]] (DLC). He saw action in the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Battle of Sedan]], in May 1940, when the German Army marched through the [[Ardennes]] into northern France. The 3rd DLC retreated from [[Meuse]] to [[Mussidan]] in the [[Dordogne]] where the division was demobilised after the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|Armistice]] was declared on 22 June 1940.\n\nReturning to Paris, Tati resumed his civilian profession as a cabaret performer, finding employment at [[L\u00e9on Volterra]]'s Lido de Paris, where he performed his ''Sporting Impressions'' from 1940 to 1942.\n\nConsidered as a possible substitute for [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] in ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'', he played the ghost in ''Sylvie and the Ghost'' (''[[Sylvie et le fant\u00f4me]]'') (Claude Autant-Lara appeared as Sylvie) and also appeared as The Devil in the same film.  Here he met Fred Orain, studio director of St. Maurice and the [[Victorine Studios|Victorine]] in [[Nice]].\n\n===Jacques Tati, director===\nIn early 1946 Jacques Tati and Fred Orain founded the production company [[Cady-Films]], which would produce Tati's first three films.\n\nWith the exception of his first and last films, Tati played the gauche and socially inept lead character, [[Monsieur Hulot]]. With his trademark raincoat, umbrella and pipe, Hulot is among the most memorable comic characters in cinema. Several themes recur in Tati's work, most notably in ''[[Mon Oncle]]'', ''[[Play Time]]'' and ''[[Trafic]]''. They include Western society's obsession with material goods, particularly American-style consumerism, the pressure-cooker environment of modern society, the superficiality of relationships among France's various social classes, and the cold and often impractical nature of space-age technology and design.\n\n===\"L'\u00c9cole des facteurs\" (\"The School for Postmen\")===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]] was first approached to direct \"[[L'\u00c9cole des facteurs]]\", but as he was preoccupied directing ''[[La Bataille du rail]]'', directing duties fell to Tati, who would also star in this short comedy of rural life. Encouragingly, L'\u00c9cole des facteurs was enthusiastically well received upon release, winning the [[Max Linder Prize]] for film comedy in 1947.\n\n===''Jour de f\u00eate (The Big Day)''===\nTati's first major feature, ''[[Jour de f\u00eate]]'' (''The Big Day''), is about an inept rural village postman who interrupts his duties to inspect the traveling fair that has come to town. Influenced by too much wine and a documentary on the rapidity of the American postal service, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed his mail deliveries aboard his bicycle. Tati filmed it in 1947 in the village of [[Sainte-S\u00e9v\u00e8re-sur-Indre]] where he had found refuge during the war. Due to the reluctance of French distributors, ''Jour de f\u00eate'' was first successfully released in London in March 1949 before obtaining a French release on 4 July 1949, where it became a great public success, receiving the 1950 [[Le Grand prix du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais]]. The film was intended to be the first French feature film shot in colour; Tati simultaneously shot the film in black and white as an insurance policy. The newly developed Thomson colour system proved impractical, as it could not deliver colour prints. ''Jour de f\u00eate'' was therefore released only in black and white. Unlike his later films, it has many scenes with dialogue, and offers a droll, affectionate view of life in rural France. The colour version was restored by his younger daughter, film editor and director Sophie Tatischeff, and released in 1995. The film won the Prize for Best Original Script at the [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\n===''Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot (Monsieur Hulot's Holiday)''===\nTati's second film, ''[[Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot]]'' (Monsieur Hulot's Holiday), was released in 1953. ''Les Vacances'' introduced the character of Mr. Hulot and follows his adventures in France during the mandatory August vacation at a beach resort, lampooning several hidebound elements of French political and social classes. It was shot almost entirely in the tiny west-coast seaside village of [[Saint-Marc-sur-Mer]] in the [[Loire Atlantique]] region. The hotel in which Mr. Hulot stays (l'H\u00f4tel de la Plage) is still there,<ref>[http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/productInfo.do?propertyCode=93667 \"l'Hotel de la Plage\"]</ref> and a statue memorialising the director has been erected on the beach.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/24/france-jacques-tati-seaside-beach | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Simkins | title=Happy vacances: Jacques Tati's France | date=24 April 2010}}</ref> Tati had fallen in love with the coast while staying in nearby Port Charlotte with his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lemoine, before the war, and resolved to return one day to make a film there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/info-departement-loire-atlantique-44.html|title=le d\u00e9partement de la Loire|website=Annuaire-Mairie|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> The film was widely praised by critics, and earned Tati an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], which was shared with [[Henri Marquet]]. Production of the movie would also see the reintroduction of Jacques Lagrange into Tati's life, beginning a lifelong working partnership with the painter, who would become his set designer. ''Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot'' remains one of the best-loved French films of that period. The film's comic influence has extended well beyond France and can be found as recently as 2007 in the [[Rowan Atkinson]] comic vehicle ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]''.<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_beans_holiday/articles/1670498/mr_beans_holiday_is_a_jolly_day_at_the_beach R ''Mr Bean's Holiday'']{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]], founder of the influential journal ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', wrote in his 1957 essay, \"Fifteen Years of French Cinema\", that,\n\n<blockquote>\"Tati could easily have made lots of money with sequels featuring his comic character of the little rural mailman. He chose instead to wait for four years, and, after much reflection, he revised his formula completely. The result this time was an extraordinary masterpiece about which one can say, I think, that it is the most radical innovation in comic cinema since the Marx Brothers: I am referring, of course, to ''Les Vacances de M. Hulot''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/64/64bazinfrenchcinema.php''|title=Andr\u00e9 Bazin: Fifteen Years of French Cinema 1957|website=brightlightsfilm.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nVarious problems would delay the release of Tati's follow-up to his international hit. In 1955 he suffered a serious car accident that physically impaired his left hand. Then a dispute with Fred Orain ensued and Tati broke away from Cady Films to create his own production company, Spectra Films, in 1956.\n\n===''Mon Oncle (My Uncle)''===\nTati's next film, 1958's ''[[Mon Oncle]]'' (''My Uncle''), was his first film to be released in colour. The plot centers on Mr. Hulot's comedic, quixotic and childlike struggle with postwar France's obsession with modernity and American-style consumerism, entwined with the relationship he has with his nine-year-old nephew G\u00e9rard. ''Mon Oncle'' quickly became an international success, and won that year's [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], a [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Special Prize]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], as well as the [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Award]]. In Place de la Pelouse ([[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]]) stands a bronze statue of Tati as Monsieur Hulot talking to a boy, in a pose echoing the movie's poster designed by [[Pierre \u00c9taix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&u=http://regis.moulu.free.fr/Tati.htm&oi=translate&sqi=2&prev=/search?q=jacques+tati+statue+saint+maur&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&prmd=ivnso|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn receiving his Oscar, Tati was offered any treat that the Academy could bestow on him. To their surprise, Tati simply requested the opportunity to visit [[Stan Laurel]], [[Mack Sennett]] and [[Buster Keaton]] at their nursing homes. Keaton reportedly said that Tati's work with sound had carried on the true tradition of silent cinema.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|1999|p=226}}, \" The Old World and the New \".</ref>\n\nAs guest artistic director at [[American Film Institute|AFI]] FEST 2010, [[David Lynch]] selected Tati's ''Mon Oncle'' alongside ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'' (Dir [[Ingmar Bergman]]), ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (Dir [[Stanley Kubrick]]), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (Dir [[Alfred Hitchcock]]) and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (Dir [[Billy Wilder]]) to be screened in his sidebar program, explaining that,\n\n<blockquote>\"I picked these particular films because they are the ones that have inspired me most.

With international renown came a growing dissatisfaction with straightforward scenarios centered around one lovable, recognizable figure. So he slowly inched his way toward a new kind of film, a supremely democratic film that would be about \"everybody\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/115-playtime,|title=Playtime|website=criterion.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> It took nine years to make, and he had to borrow heavily from his own resources to complete the picture. \"At the time of its making, ''Playtime'' (1967) was the most expensive film in French history.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebertfest.com/seven/playtime.htm|title=\"Roger Ebert, Ebertfest, Playtime\"|website=ebertfest.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317141508/http://ebertfest.com/seven/playtime.htm|archivedate=17 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \"'Play Time' is the big leap, the big screen. I'm putting myself on the line. Either it comes off or it doesn't. There's no safety net.\" On the outskirts of Paris, Tati famously built an entire glass and steel mini-city (nicknamed Tativille) for the film, which took years to build and left him mired in debt.\n\nIn the film, Hulot and a group of American tourists lose themselves in the futuristic glass and steel of commercially globalised modern Parisian suburbs, where only human nature and a few reflective views of the old city of Paris, itself, still emerge to breathe life into the sterile new metropolis. ''Play Time'' had even less of a plot than his earlier films, and Tati endeavored to make his characters, including Hulot, almost incidental to his portrayal of a modernist and robotic Paris. ''Play Time'' was originally 155 minutes in length, but Tati soon released an edited version of 126 minutes, and this is the version that became a general theatre release in 1967. Later versions appeared in 35mm format. In 1979, a copy of the film was revised again to 108 minutes, and this re-edited version was released on VHS video in 1984. Though ''Play Time'' was a critical success ([[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] praised it as \"a film that comes from another planet, where they make films differently\"), it was a massive and expensive commercial failure, eventually resulting in Tati's bankruptcy. \"Tati had approached everybody from [[Darryl F Zanuck]] to the prime minister [[Georges Pompidou]] in a bid to get the movie completed. His personal overdrafts began to mount, and long before 'Play Time'was finished,\" Bellos notes, \"Tati was in substantial debt to the least forgiving of all creditors, the Collectors of Taxes.\" When he failed to pay off his loans, his films were impounded by the banks\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Tati for Now\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/21/artsfeatures.cannes2002|title=Tati for now|first=Geoffrey|last=Macnab|date=21 May 2002|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Tati was forced to sell the family house of Saint-Germain shortly after the death of his mother, Claire Van Hoof, and move back into Paris. Spectra Films was then placed into administration, concluding in the liquidation of the company in 1974, with an auction of all movie rights held by the company for little more than 120,000 francs.\n\nIn 1969, with reduced means, Jacques Tati created a new production company, CEPEC, to oversee his opportunities in movie and TV production.\n\n====Spin-offs of ''Play Time''====\nWhile on the set of ''Play Time'', Tati made a short film about his comedic and cinematic technique, ''[[Cours du soir]]'' (''Evening Classes'', 1967), in which Tati gives a lesson in the art of comedy to a class of would-be actors.\n\nIn 1971 Tati \"Suffered the indignity of having to make an advert for [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in England\",<ref name=\"The Guardian Tati for Now\"/> in which he depicted a dehumanized bank of the future, with money dispensed by a computerized counter. \"The message of the advert was that however modern Lloyds are, technology isn't everything and you'll always be able to speak to a \"friendly member of staff or understanding manager\" in their branches\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money-watch.co.uk/8078/bank-of-the-future-in-1971|title=Bank Of The Future (In 1971)|date=15 February 2011|website=money-watch.co.uk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Reception====\nIn August 2012 the [[British Film Institute]], polled 846 critics, programmers, academics and distributors to find \"The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\" and ''Play Time'' was voted 42nd in the list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time - Sight & Sound|website=bfi.org.uk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> In the corresponding \"Directors Poll\" by the BFI, Playtime was awarded the accolade of being seen as the 37th greatest film of all time by his fellow directors.\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] has said he was paying a \"very slight homage\" to ''Play Time'' in his 2004 film ''[[The Terminal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,613634,00.html|title=''The Terminal'' is a summer movie we can't wait to see|date=21 April 2004|website=ew.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> adding, \"I thought of two directors when I made Terminal.

It was the last Hulot film, and followed the vein of earlier works that lampooned modern society. In the film, Hulot is a bumbling automobile inventor traveling to an exhibition in a gadget-filled recreational vehicle. Despite its modest budget, Trafic was still very much a Tati film, carefully staged and choreographed in its scenes and effects.\n\n===''Parade''===\nTati's last completed film, ''[[Parade (1974 film)|Parade]]'', a film produced for Swedish television in 1973, is more or less a filmed circus performance featuring Tati's mime acts and other performers.\n\n===''Forza Bastia''===\nIn 1978, Tati began filming a short documentary on [[Corsica]]n football team [[SC Bastia]] playing the [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup Final]], \"[[Forza Bastia]]\", which he did not complete. His younger daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, later edited the remaining footage, which was released in 2002 after her own death from lung cancer in 2001.\n\n===Unmade films===\n====''Confusion''====\nBefore his death, Tati had plans for at least one more film. ''Confusion'', a planned collaboration with pop duo [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], was a story about a futuristic city (Paris) where activity is centred around television, communication, advertising, and modern society's infatuation with visual imagery.\n\nIn the original script an aging Mr. Hulot was slated to be accidentally killed on-air. [[Ron Mael]] and [[Russell Mael]] would have played two American TV studio employees brought to a rural French TV company to help them out with some American technical expertise and input into how TV is really done.

The bank, unable to trace the owner who had made the deposit, eventually returned the rights to Pierre and Sophie as heirs to their father's estate.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1995 after a year of meticulous work, Sophie with the aid of film technician Francois Ede was able for the first time to release a colour print of ''Jour de Fete'' as Tati had originally intended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1998/01/jour-de-fete/|title=Jour de fete - Jonathan Rosenbaum|website=www.jonathanrosenbaum.net|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHaving lost her brother Pierre to a traffic accident and having herself been diagnosed terminally ill, Sophie Tatischeff took the initiative to set up Les Films de Mon Oncle in 2001 to preserve, restore, and circulate the work of Jacques Tati. Enrolling the service of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Deschamps]], the artistic and cultural mission of Les Films de Mon Oncle is to allow audiences as well as researchers to (re-)discover the work of Tati the filmmaker, his archives, and to ensure its influence around the world.\n\nThe restoration of ''PlayTime'' began in 1998 when Sophie Tatischeff made the acquaintance of Jean-Rene Failot, technical director of the [[Gulliver Arane]], the only remaining large-format film laboratory in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in70mm.com/news/2004/playtime/index.htm|title=The restoration of \"Play Time\"|website=in70mm.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509185154/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2004/playtime/index.htm|archive-date=9 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Because of difficulties acquiring appropriate funding, the restored version of ''PlayTime'' was not presented until 2002 at the 55th Cannes Film Festival, eight months after the death of Sophie Tatischeff. In 2004, Les Films de Mon Oncle completed the restoration of ''My Uncle'', the English version of ''Mon Oncle''. This was followed by demanding editorial work for the DVDs of these films including original bonuses and a double CD titled ''Tati Sonorama!'' with the complete collection of film scores and soundtrack clips.\n\nIn 2009 the partner of Deschamps, Macha Make\u00efeff, designed the exhibition \"{{Lang|fr|Jacques Tati, deux temps, trois mouvements}}\" at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] in Paris, for which she is co-curator along with [[:fr:St\u00e9phane Goudet|Stephane Goudet]], and installed the full-scale mythical Villa Arpel, the set of ''Mon Oncle'' created by Jacques Tati and his friend [[:fr:Jacques Lagrange (peintre)|Jacques Lagrange]], at the 104 (Paris, 19th arrondissement).\n\nIn 2014 Les Films de Mon Oncle formed a partnership with ''[[StudioCanal]]'', entitled ''[[Vivendi]]'', who now oversee international distribution of the oeuvre of Jacques Tati, having released digitally restored versions of all his short and long films as boxsets in both DVD and Blu-Ray.\n\n[[Rowan Atkinson]] cited Tati as an inspiration for the physical comedy approach of his internationally renowned character [[Mr. Bean|Mr Bean]], claiming, when asked about what influenced him, ''\"I think it was particularly a French comedian called Jacques Tati. I loved his movies, and you know, \"Mr. Hulot's Holiday\" I remember seeing when I was 17 -- that was a major inspiration. He opened a window to a world that I'd never looked out on before, and I thought, \"God, that's interesting,\" how a comic situation can be developed as purely visual and yet it's not under-cranked, it's not speeded-up, Benny Hill comedy -- it's more deliberate; it takes its time. And I enjoyed that\".'' <ref>https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-20150326-column.html</ref>\n\nOn an interview at \"The 11\", independent animation director [[Bill Plympton]] labeled Tati as a major influence on his work. According to Plympton \"''his jokes are very visual, there is not a lot of verbal interplay and talking, which I like. He's such a great character. {His films} are surreal, they are very dry, its not slapstick where you trip on a rake and fall on the ground, its very subtle humor, very sensitive humor, and very ironic humor. I love the irony in his works. He's a very good example of one of my influences''.\" <ref> {{title=Bill Plymptton Does \"The 11\" with Alone In The Dark Film Blog|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8b-jWYNNA4}} </ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"33\" | Year !!

His father, George Emmanuel Tatischeff, born in 1875 in Paris (d. 1957), was the son of Dmitry Tatishchev (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0432), General of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and [[military attach\u00e9]] to the Russian Embassy in Paris. The Tatischeffs (also spelled Tatishchev) were a Russian noble family of patrilineal [[Rurikid]] descent.  Whilst stationed in Paris Dmitri Tatischeff married a French woman, Rose Anathalie Alinquant. (Russian sources indicate that she was a circus performer and that they never married.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russian.rfi.fr/kultura/20110220-multfilm-illyuzionist-i-docheri-zhaka-tati|title=\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 - \u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \"\u0418\u043b\u043b\u044e\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\" \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0416\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0438|date=20 February 2011|website=rfi.fr|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nUnder suspicious circumstances Dmitri Tatischeff died from injuries sustained in a horse-riding accident shortly after the birth of George Emmanuel. As a child George Emmanuel experienced turbulent times, such as being forcibly removed from France and taken to Russia to live. In 1883 his mother brought him back to France where they settled on the estate of [[Le Pecq]], near [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] on the outskirts of Paris.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=1}}, \" Une famille bien fran\u00e7aise : les Tatischeff \"</ref> In 1903, Georges-Emmanuel Tatischeff married the Dutch-Italian Marcelle Claire van Hoof (d. 1968).

Subsequently, Georges-Emmanuel became the director of the company Cadres Van Hoof, and the Tatischeff family enjoyed a relatively high standard of living.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=2}}, \"Les Cadres Van Hoof\".</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJacques Tatischeff appears to have been an indifferent student, yet excelled in the sports of tennis and horse riding. He left school in 1923 at the age of 16 to take up an apprenticeship in the family business, where he was trained as a picture framer by his grandfather. Between 1927 and 1928 he completed his military national service at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] with the Cavalry's 16th Regiment of Dragoons.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=3}}, \"Le dragon\".</ref> Upon graduating the military he took on an apprenticeship in London where he was first introduced to the sport of [[Rugby football|rugby]]. Returning to Paris, he joined the semi-professional rugby team Racing Club de France, whose captain was [[Alfred Sauvy]] and whose supporters included [[Tristan Bernard]]. It was at the Racing Club de France that Jacques Tatischeff first discovered his comic talents, entertaining his teammates during intervals with hilarious impersonations of their sporting endeavours. He also first met [[Jacques Broido]], and they would become lifelong friends.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=4}}, \"Dr\u00f4le d'\u00e9cole\".</ref>\n\nBetween 1931 and 1932 the [[Great Depression in France|global economic crisis reached France]]<ref>Il a conserv\u00e9 le statut et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d'apprenti, n'ayant pas r\u00e9ussi l'examen pour devenir ouvrier.</ref> at the same time he left both the Racing Club de France and, to his family's disapproval, his apprenticeship at Cadres Van Hoof. Giving up a relatively comfortable middle-class lifestyle for one of a struggling performing artist during this difficult economic time, he developed a collection of highly physical mimes that would become his ''Impressions Sportives'' (''Sporting Impressions''). Each year from 1931 to 1934 he would participate in an amateur show organised by Alfred Sauvy.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|p=56 et 57}} : affiches pour 1931 (''Sport muet par Jacques Tattischeff'') et 1933, o\u00f9 il est cit\u00e9 en haut de l'affiche : ''J. Taticheff''.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Kabarett der Komiker; Jacques Tati 013575c.jpg|thumb|right|Tati in Germany, 1938.]]\n===Early work===\nAlthough he had likely played music hall engagements before, his act was first mentioned in 1935, when he performed at the gala for the newspaper ''[[Le Journal]]'' to celebrate the French victory in the competition to set the transatlantic crossing record from [[Normandy]]. Among the honourable spectators was the influential writer [[Colette]]. Tati's act also caught the attention of [[Max Trebor]], who offered him an engagement at the Theatre-Michel, where he quickly became the star act. After his success there, Tati tried to make it in London, playing a short season at the [[Finsbury Park Empire]] in March 1936. Upon his return to Paris in the same year, he was immediately hired as top billing at the ABC Th\u00e9\u00e2tre<ref name=ABC>[[:fr:ABC (music-hall)|ABC_(music-hall)]] French Wikipedia for l'ABC</ref> alongside the singer [[Marie Dubas]], where he would work uninterrupted until the outbreak of the Second World War.<ref>{{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=6, 8, 10}}.</ref> It was for Tati's performances of his now finely tuned ''Impressions Sportives'' at the ABC that the previously impressed Colette wrote,\n\n<blockquote>\"From now on no celebration, no artistic or acrobatic spectacle can do without this amazing performer, who has invented something quite his own...His act is partly ballet and partly sport, partly satire and partly a charade. He has devised a way of being both the player, the ball and the tennis racquet, of being simultaneously the football and the goalkeeper, the boxer and his opponent, the bicycle and the cyclist. Without any props, he conjures up his accessories and his partners. He has suggestive powers of all great artists. How gratifying it was to see the audience's warm reaction! Tati's success says a lot about the sophistication of the allegedly \"uncouth\" public, about its taste for novelty and its appreciation of style. Jacques Tati, the horse and rider conjured, will show all of Paris the living image of that legendary creature, the centaur.\"<ref>Colette, \"Spectacles de Paris\", '''Le Journal''', 28 June 1936, quoted in {{harvsp|Bellos|2002|loc=63}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the 1930s he also performed at the [[Scala (Berlin)|Scala]] in Berlin between 1937 and 1938, and began to experiment with film acting in the following shorts:\n\n*1932: ''Oscar, champion de tennis'' directed by [[Jack Forrester (director)|Jack Forrester]] written by and starring Jacques Tati (film lost);\n*1934: ''On demande une brute'' directed by [[Charles Barrois (b.1890)|Charles Barrois]], with Jacques Tati as (''Roger''), Enrico Sprocani as ''le clown Rhum'' (''Enrico'');\n*1935: ''[[Gai dimanche]]'' directed by [[Jacques Berr]], wrote and starring Jacques Tati and Enrico Sprocani; and\n*1936: ''Soigne ton gauche'' directed by [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], starring Jacques Tati (''Roger''), Jacques Broido (''sparring partner''), Max Martel (''the postman'').\n\n===World War II===\nIn September 1939 Tati was conscripted back into his 16th Regiment of Dragoons which was then incorporated into the [[3rd Division Legere de Cavalerie]] (DLC). He saw action in the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Battle of Sedan]], in May 1940, when the German Army marched through the [[Ardennes]] into northern France. The 3rd DLC retreated from [[Meuse]] to [[Mussidan]] in the [[Dordogne]] where the division was demobilised after the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|Armistice]] was declared on 22 June 1940.\n\nReturning to Paris, Tati resumed his civilian profession as a cabaret performer, finding employment at [[L\u00e9on Volterra]]'s Lido de Paris, where he performed his ''Sporting Impressions'' from 1940 to 1942.\n\nConsidered as a possible substitute for [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] in ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'', he played the ghost in ''Sylvie and the Ghost'' (''[[Sylvie et le fant\u00f4me]]'') (Claude Autant-Lara appeared as Sylvie) and also appeared as The Devil in the same film.  Here he met Fred Orain, studio director of St. Maurice and the [[Victorine Studios|Victorine]] in [[Nice]].\n\n===Jacques Tati, director===\nIn early 1946 Jacques Tati and Fred Orain founded the production company [[Cady-Films]], which would produce Tati's first three films.\n\nWith the exception of his first and last films, Tati played the gauche and socially inept lead character, [[Monsieur Hulot]]. With his trademark raincoat, umbrella and pipe, Hulot is among the most memorable comic characters in cinema. Several themes recur in Tati's work, most notably in ''[[Mon Oncle]]'', ''[[Play Time]]'' and ''[[Trafic]]''. They include Western society's obsession with material goods, particularly American-style consumerism, the pressure-cooker environment of modern society, the superficiality of relationships among France's various social classes, and the cold and often impractical nature of space-age technology and design.\n\n===\"L'\u00c9cole des facteurs\" (\"The School for Postmen\")===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]] was first approached to direct \"[[L'\u00c9cole des facteurs]]\", but as he was preoccupied directing ''[[La Bataille du rail]]'', directing duties fell to Tati, who would also star in this short comedy of rural life. Encouragingly, L'\u00c9cole des facteurs was enthusiastically well received upon release, winning the [[Max Linder Prize]] for film comedy in 1947.\n\n===''Jour de f\u00eate (The Big Day)''===\nTati's first major feature, ''[[Jour de f\u00eate]]'' (''The Big Day''), is about an inept rural village postman who interrupts his duties to inspect the traveling fair that has come to town. Influenced by too much wine and a documentary on the rapidity of the American postal service, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed his mail deliveries aboard his bicycle. Tati filmed it in 1947 in the village of [[Sainte-S\u00e9v\u00e8re-sur-Indre]] where he had found refuge during the war. Due to the reluctance of French distributors, ''Jour de f\u00eate'' was first successfully released in London in March 1949 before obtaining a French release on 4 July 1949, where it became a great public success, receiving the 1950 [[Le Grand prix du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais]]. The film was intended to be the first French feature film shot in colour; Tati simultaneously shot the film in black and white as an insurance policy. The newly developed Thomson colour system proved impractical, as it could not deliver colour prints. ''Jour de f\u00eate'' was therefore released only in black and white. Unlike his later films, it has many scenes with dialogue, and offers a droll, affectionate view of life in rural France. The colour version was restored by his younger daughter, film editor and director Sophie Tatischeff, and released in 1995. The film won the Prize for Best Original Script at the [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\n===''Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot (Monsieur Hulot's Holiday)''===\nTati's second film, ''[[Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot]]'' (Monsieur Hulot's Holiday), was released in 1953. ''Les Vacances'' introduced the character of Mr. Hulot and follows his adventures in France during the mandatory August vacation at a beach resort, lampooning several hidebound elements of French political and social classes. It was shot almost entirely in the tiny west-coast seaside village of [[Saint-Marc-sur-Mer]] in the [[Loire Atlantique]] region. The hotel in which Mr. Hulot stays (l'H\u00f4tel de la Plage) is still there,<ref>[http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/productInfo.do?propertyCode=93667 \"l'Hotel de la Plage\"]</ref> and a statue memorialising the director has been erected on the beach.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/24/france-jacques-tati-seaside-beach | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Simkins | title=Happy vacances: Jacques Tati's France | date=24 April 2010}}</ref> Tati had fallen in love with the coast while staying in nearby Port Charlotte with his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lemoine, before the war, and resolved to return one day to make a film there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/info-departement-loire-atlantique-44.html|title=le d\u00e9partement de la Loire|website=Annuaire-Mairie|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> The film was widely praised by critics, and earned Tati an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], which was shared with [[Henri Marquet]]. Production of the movie would also see the reintroduction of Jacques Lagrange into Tati's life, beginning a lifelong working partnership with the painter, who would become his set designer. ''Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot'' remains one of the best-loved French films of that period. The film's comic influence has extended well beyond France and can be found as recently as 2007 in the [[Rowan Atkinson]] comic vehicle ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]''.<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_beans_holiday/articles/1670498/mr_beans_holiday_is_a_jolly_day_at_the_beach R ''Mr Bean's Holiday'']{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]], founder of the influential journal ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', wrote in his 1957 essay, \"Fifteen Years of French Cinema\", that,\n\n<blockquote>\"Tati could easily have made lots of money with sequels featuring his comic character of the little rural mailman. He chose instead to wait for four years, and, after much reflection, he revised his formula completely.

Hulot''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/64/64bazinfrenchcinema.php''|title=Andr\u00e9 Bazin: Fifteen Years of French Cinema 1957|website=brightlightsfilm.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nVarious problems would delay the release of Tati's follow-up to his international hit. In 1955 he suffered a serious car accident that physically impaired his left hand. Then a dispute with Fred Orain ensued and Tati broke away from Cady Films to create his own production company, Spectra Films, in 1956.\n\n===''Mon Oncle (My Uncle)''===\nTati's next film, 1958's ''[[Mon Oncle]]'' (''My Uncle''), was his first film to be released in colour. The plot centers on Mr. Hulot's comedic, quixotic and childlike struggle with postwar France's obsession with modernity and American-style consumerism, entwined with the relationship he has with his nine-year-old nephew G\u00e9rard. ''Mon Oncle'' quickly became an international success, and won that year's [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], a [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Special Prize]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], as well as the [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Award]].

To their surprise, Tati simply requested the opportunity to visit [[Stan Laurel]], [[Mack Sennett]] and [[Buster Keaton]] at their nursing homes.

I'm putting myself on the line. Either it comes off or it doesn't. There's no safety net.\" On the outskirts of Paris, Tati famously built an entire glass and steel mini-city (nicknamed Tativille) for the film, which took years to build and left him mired in debt.\n\nIn the film, Hulot and a group of American tourists lose themselves in the futuristic glass and steel of commercially globalised modern Parisian suburbs, where only human nature and a few reflective views of the old city of Paris, itself, still emerge to breathe life into the sterile new metropolis. ''Play Time'' had even less of a plot than his earlier films, and Tati endeavored to make his characters, including Hulot, almost incidental to his portrayal of a modernist and robotic Paris. ''Play Time'' was originally 155 minutes in length, but Tati soon released an edited version of 126 minutes, and this is the version that became a general theatre release in 1967. Later versions appeared in 35mm format. In 1979, a copy of the film was revised again to 108 minutes, and this re-edited version was released on VHS video in 1984. Though ''Play Time'' was a critical success ([[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] praised it as \"a film that comes from another planet, where they make films differently\"), it was a massive and expensive commercial failure, eventually resulting in Tati's bankruptcy. \"Tati had approached everybody from [[Darryl F Zanuck]] to the prime minister [[Georges Pompidou]] in a bid to get the movie completed. His personal overdrafts began to mount, and long before 'Play Time'was finished,\" Bellos notes, \"Tati was in substantial debt to the least forgiving of all creditors, the Collectors of Taxes.\" When he failed to pay off his loans, his films were impounded by the banks\".<ref name=\"The Guardian Tati for Now\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/21/artsfeatures.cannes2002|title=Tati for now|first=Geoffrey|last=Macnab|date=21 May 2002|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Tati was forced to sell the family house of Saint-Germain shortly after the death of his mother, Claire Van Hoof, and move back into Paris. Spectra Films was then placed into administration, concluding in the liquidation of the company in 1974, with an auction of all movie rights held by the company for little more than 120,000 francs.\n\nIn 1969, with reduced means, Jacques Tati created a new production company, CEPEC, to oversee his opportunities in movie and TV production.\n\n====Spin-offs of ''Play Time''====\nWhile on the set of ''Play Time'', Tati made a short film about his comedic and cinematic technique, ''[[Cours du soir]]'' (''Evening Classes'', 1967), in which Tati gives a lesson in the art of comedy to a class of would-be actors.\n\nIn 1971 Tati \"Suffered the indignity of having to make an advert for [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in England\"<ref name=\"The Guardian Tati for Now\"/> in which he depicted the bank of the future as being dehumanized with money dispensed from a computerized counter. \"The message of the advert was that however modern Lloyds are, technology isn't everything and you'll always be able to speak to a \"friendly member of staff or understanding manager\" in their branches\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money-watch.co.uk/8078/bank-of-the-future-in-1971|title=Bank Of The Future (In 1971)|date=15 February 2011|website=money-watch.co.uk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Reception====\nIn August 2012 the [[British Film Institute]], polled 846 critics, programmers, academics and distributors to find \"The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\" and ''Play Time'' was voted 42nd in the list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time - Sight & Sound|website=bfi.org.uk|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> In the corresponding \"Directors Poll\" by the BFI, Playtime was awarded the accolade of being seen as the 37th greatest film of all time by his fellow directors.\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] has said he was paying a \"very slight homage\" to ''Play Time'' in his 2004 film ''[[The Terminal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,613634,00.html|title=''The Terminal'' is a summer movie we can't wait to see|date=21 April 2004|website=ew.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> adding, \"I thought of two directors when I made Terminal.

It was the last Hulot film, and followed the vein of earlier works that lampooned modern society. In the film, Hulot is a bumbling automobile inventor traveling to an exhibition in a gadget-filled recreational vehicle. Despite its modest budget, Trafic was still very much a Tati film, carefully staged and choreographed in its scenes and effects.\n\n===''Parade''===\nTati's last completed film, ''[[Parade (1974 film)|Parade]]'', a film produced for Swedish television in 1973, is more or less a filmed circus performance featuring Tati's mime acts and other performers.\n\n===''Forza Bastia''===\nIn 1978, Tati began filming a short documentary on [[Corsica]]n football team [[SC Bastia]] playing the [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup Final]], \"[[Forza Bastia]]\", which he did not complete. His younger daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, later edited the remaining footage, which was released in 2002 after her own death from lung cancer in 2001.\n\n===Unmade films===\n====''Confusion''====\nBefore his death, Tati had plans for at least one more film. ''Confusion'', a planned collaboration with pop duo [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], was a story about a futuristic city (Paris) where activity is centred around television, communication, advertising, and modern society's infatuation with visual imagery.\n\nIn the original script an aging Mr. Hulot was slated to be accidentally killed on-air. [[Ron Mael]] and [[Russell Mael]] would have played two American TV studio employees brought to a rural French TV company to help them out with some American technical expertise and input into how TV is really done.
