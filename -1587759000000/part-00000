From the FAA Air Directive: \"The potential loss of the stale-data monitoring function of the CCS when continuously powered on for 51 days, if not addressed, could result in erroneous flight-critical data being routed and displayed as valid data, which could reduce the ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/}}\n\n{{Intel software}}\n{{Real-time operating systems}}\n\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Intel software]]\n[[Category:MIPS operating systems]]\n[[Category:PowerPC operating systems]]\n[[Category:Real-time operating systems]]\n[[Category:Robot operating systems]]\n[[Category:X86 operating systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=June 2017}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2014}}\n{{prose|date=July 2014}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=August 2014}}\n}}\n{{Infobox OS\n| name                   = VxWorks\n| logo                   = VxWorks symbol by Wind River Systems.png\n| logo_size              = 65px\n| screenshot             = File:VxWorks_7_Bootup_Screen.png\n| screenshot_size        = 200px\n| caption                = VxWorks 7 boot-up screen\n| developer              = [[Wind River Systems|Wind River]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[TPG Capital]])\n| source_model           =\n| kernel_type            = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]]\n| supported_platforms    = [[x86]] (including [[Intel Quark]]), [[x86-64]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH|SH-4]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]]\n| ui                     =\n| family                 = [[Real-time operating system]]s\n| released               = {{start date and age|1987}}\n| latest_release_version = 7\n| latest_release_date    = {{start date and age|2014|03}}\n| latest_test_version    = \n| latest_test_date       =\n| marketing_target       = [[Embedded system]]s\n| updatemodel            =\n| package_manager        =\n| license                = Proprietary\n| working state          = Current\n| website                = {{URL|https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks|Windriver.com/products/vxworks}}\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''VxWorks''' is a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) developed as [[proprietary software]] by [[Wind River Systems]], a wholly owned subsidiary of TPG Capital, US.

From the FAA Air Directive: \"The potential loss of the stale-data monitoring function of the CCS when continuously powered on for 51 days, if not addressed, could result in erroneous flight-critical data being routed and displayed as valid data, which could reduce the ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/}}\n\n{{Intel software}}\n{{Real-time operating systems}}\n\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Intel software]]\n[[Category:MIPS operating systems]]\n[[Category:PowerPC operating systems]]\n[[Category:Real-time operating systems]]\n[[Category:Robot operating systems]]\n[[Category:X86 operating systems]]\n", "name_user": "Grizba2020", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTCP vulnerability", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks"}

Aged 72 at the end of his chancellorship, he was the [[List of Austrian Chancellors by Longevity|oldest Chancellor]] after [[World War II]]. His 13-year tenure was the longest of any Chancellor in republican Austria.\n\n== Life and political career ==\nKreisky was born in [[Margareten]], a district of [[Vienna]], to a non-observant [[Jewish]] family. His parents were Max Kreisky (1876, [[Klatovy]] \u2013 1944)<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Max-Kreisky/6000000007320495732]</ref> and Irene Felix Kreisky n\u00e9e Felix (1884, [[T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]] \u2013 1969).<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Irene-Kreisky/6000000008800422390]</ref> His father worked as a textile manufacturer.<ref name=\"weininternational\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wieninternational.at/en/content/100th-anniversary-birth-bruno-kreisky-en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401140842/http://www.wieninternational.at/en/content/100th-anniversary-birth-bruno-kreisky-en |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} 100th anniversary of the birth of Bruno Kreisky, 11 January 2011{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Shocked by the level of poverty and violence in Austria during the 1920s, he joined the youth wing of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) in 1925 at age 15. In 1927, he joined the Young Socialist Workers against the wishes of his parents. In 1929, he began studying law at the [[University of Vienna]] at the advice of [[Otto Bauer]], who urged him to study law rather than medicine, as he had originally planned. He remained politically active during this period. In 1931, he left the Jewish religious community, becoming agnostic.<ref name=\"weininternational\"/> In 1934, when the Socialist Party was banned by the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Dollfuss]] dictatorship, he became active in underground political work. He was arrested in January 1935 and convicted of [[high treason]], but was released in June 1936. In March 1938 the Austrian state was incorporated into Germany through the ''[[Anschluss]]'', and in September Kreisky escaped the Nazi persecution of Austrian Jews and the coming [[Holocaust]] by emigrating to [[Sweden]], where he remained until 1945. On 23 April 1942, he married Vera F\u00fcrth (30 December 1916 \u2013 5 December 1988).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/wiki/index.php?title=Bruno_Kreisky&printable=yes |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211190056/https://www.wien.gv.at/wiki/index.php?title=Bruno_Kreisky&printable=yes |archive-date=11 February 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and had one son and one daughter.\n\nHe returned to Austria in May 1946, but he was soon back in [[Stockholm]], assigned to the Austrian legation. In 1951 he returned to Vienna, where Federal President [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (Austrian president)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]] appointed him Assistant Chief of Staff and political adviser. In 1953 he was appointed Undersecretary in the Foreign Affairs Department of the Austrian Chancellery. In this position he took part in negotiating the 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]], which ended the four-power occupation of Austria and restored Austria's independence and neutrality.\n\nKreisky was elected to the Austrian parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]] as a Socialist during the [[1956 Austrian legislative election|1956 election]]. He was elected to the Party Executive along with [[Bruno Pittermann]], Felix Slavik, and [[Franz Olah]], and thus became a member of the central leadership body of the party. After the [[1959 Austrian legislative election|1959 election]], he became Foreign Minister in the [[coalition]] cabinet of Chancellor [[Julius Raab]] ([[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]]), a post he continued to hold under Raab's successors [[Alfons Gorbach]] (1961\u20131964) and [[Josef Klaus]] (1964\u20131966). He played a leading role in setting up the [[European Free Trade Association]], helped solve the [[South Tyrol]] question with Italy, and proposed a \"[[Marshall Plan]]\" for the countries of the [[Third World]].\n\nIn 1966, the \u00d6VP under Klaus won an absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Although Klaus could have governed alone, memories of the hyperpartisanship that characterized the First Republic were still very strong, and he wanted to continue the grand coalition that had governed since 1945. However, talks between Klaus and Kreisky broke down. Kreisky resigned from cabinet, and the \u00d6VP formed the first one-party government of the Second Republic. However, the Socialists were not completely shut out of power; they were informally consulted on all major decisions.\n\nIn February 1967, Kreisky was elected chairman of the Socialist Party. At the [[1970 Austrian legislative election|March 1970 elections]], the Socialists won 81 seats, two short of a majority. Kreisky became the first Socialist Chancellor since 1920, heading the first purely left-wing government in modern Austrian history. He was also Austria's first Jewish Chancellor. Kreisky's government was tolerated by the then national-liberals [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in return for electoral reforms that were intended to give smaller parties a greater voice. Following the passage of these reforms, he called fresh elections in [[1971 Austrian legislative election|October 1971]]. At these elections, the Socialists won a sweeping victory, winning a strong majority government with 93 seats. They also won half the popular vote, something no Austrian party had ever achieved in a free election. Kreisky was reelected in [[1975 Austrian legislative election|1975]] and [[1979 Austrian legislative election|1979 elections]], each time winning comfortable majorities in the Nationalrat.\n\nKreisky turned 70 in 1981, and by this time the voters had become increasingly uncomfortable with what they saw as his complacency and preoccupation with international issues. At the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 election]], the Socialists lost their absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Kreisky declined to form a minority government and resigned, nominating [[Fred Sinowatz]], his Minister of Education, as his successor. His health was declining, and in 1984 he had an emergency [[kidney]] [[organ transplant|transplant]]. During his final years he occasionally made bitter remarks directed at his party, who had made him their honorary chairman. He died in Vienna in July 1990.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/obituaries/bruno-kreisky-austria-s-leader-for-a-record-13-years-dies-at-79.html</ref>\n\n== Political views and programs ==\n[[File:Kreisky (left) with Fateh 1962.jpg|right|thumb|Kreisky (left) with [[Abul Fateh]] in Vienna, 1962.]]\nIn office, Kreisky and his close ally, Justice Minister [[Christian Broda]], pursued a policy of liberal reform, in a country which had a tradition of conservative [[Roman Catholicism]]. He reformed Austria's family law and its prisons, and he decriminalised abortion and homosexuality. Nevertheless, he sought to bridge the gap between the Catholic Church and the Austrian Socialist movement and found a willing collaborator in the then Cardinal [[Archbishop of Vienna]], [[Franz K\u00f6nig]]. Kreisky promised to reduce the mandatory military service from nine to six months. After his election, military service was reduced to eight months (if performed in one stretch, or six months plus eight weeks if broken into two segments).\n\nDuring Kreisky's premiership, a wide range of progressive reforms was carried out.<ref>https://www.sozialversicherung.at/portal27/sec/portal/esv_enportal/content/contentWindow?contentid=10007.687468&action=2{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Amongst other reforms, employee benefits were expanded, the workweek was cut to 40 hours, and legislation providing for equality for women was passed. Kreisky's government established language rights for the country's [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croats|Croatian]] minorities. Following the [[1973 oil crisis|1974 oil shock]], Kreisky committed Austria to developing [[nuclear power]] to reduce dependence on oil, although this policy was eventually abandoned after a [[referendum]] held in 1978. A moderate reform of the penal code was carried out, discrimination against illegitimate children was eliminated, marriage grants were introduced, mother-child pass (a pre-natal/post-natal care and infant health program) was established, a major reform of the penal code was carried out, and sex equality legislation was passed. In addition, four weeks of annual vacation were introduced, the office of ombudsman was established, the law of parentage was reordered, consumer protection legislation was passed, and social security coverage of the self-employed was introduced.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=1371 Austria under Social Democratic Rule: The Kreisky Years], H-net.org</ref> In 1979, restrictions on redundancy and the dismissal of employees were made.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HmNpl0wNa8AC&pg=PA513&dq=bruno+kreisky+social+insurance+1976&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=bruno%20kreisky%20social%20insurance%201976&f=false Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, Volume 1], edited by A.

In 1978, due to a change from tax allowances to direct payments for children, family benefits increased significantly. Between 1973 and 1980, expenditure on health and education rose on average by 13.7% and by 12.9% per annum respectively. In education, pupil/teacher ratios fell sharply and a new university law was passed in 1975 in order to make higher education more democratic.<ref>Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice</ref> The educational sector was significantly expanded under Kreisky, greatly increasing the numbers of Austrians receiving a university education.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B8iJNlWcdIUC&pg=PA263&dq=bruno+kreisky+free+university+education&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mgDzUZTvF-Sr0gWimYC4Aw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=bruno%20kreisky%20free%20university%20education&f=false Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe: A Biographical Dictionary], David Wilsford, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p. 263 (at Google Books)</ref>\n\nThe 1972 Crime Victims Act established the principles of compensation for health damages caused (directly or indirectly) by crimes punishable by more than 6 months' imprisonment. The 1974 Town Renovation Act dealt with the renovation of residential town areas, while the 1975 Housing Property Act established the property rights of house- and flat-owners. In 1975, housing supplements were extended to cover costs of housing improvements. In 1974, the work prohibiting periods before and after work birth were extended up to 8 weeks, and in 1976 the regulations were extended to adoptive mothers. A 1981 law adapted pension schemes to changes in the families' loads equalisation scheme, and introduced a widowers' pension equivalent to the widows' pension. In 1976, accident insurance for pupils and students was introduced, while an act passed that same year enabled people to undertake the care of close relatives who were ill.<ref>Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora</ref> Under the Bankruptcy Wage Continuation Act of 1979, claims against bankrupt firms were paid from a special fund.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F16VaIYewIEC&pg=PA556&dq=growth+to+limits+Bankruptcy+Wage+Continuation+Act+of+1979&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ogYiUtjOBsWM7Qa25YGQBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=growth%20to%20limits%20Bankruptcy%20Wage%20Continuation%20Act%20of%201979&f=false Growth to Limits: Appendix (synopses, bibliographies, tables)], Peter Flora and Walter de Gruyter, 1987, p. 556 (at Google Books)</ref> In 1982, a maternity allowance payable for 16 weeks was introduced for self-employed women.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7Jl2uDV4300C&pg=PA63&dq=1982+law+maternity+benefits+for+self-employed+women&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RAYiUrb1Ga7W7QaA3YGgDA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1982%20law%20maternity%20benefits%20for%20self-employed%20women&f=false Women and Social Security: Progress Towards Equality of Treatment], Anne-Marie Brocas, Anne-Marie Cailloux, Virginie Oget, International Labour Organization, 1990, p. 63, (at Google Books)</ref>\n\nKreisky played a prominent role in international affairs, promoting dialogue between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], and working with like-minded European leaders such as [[Willy Brandt]] and [[Olof Palme]] to promote peace and development. Although the 1955 State Treaty prevented Austria from joining the [[European Union]], he supported European integration. Austria cast itself as a bridge between East and West, and Vienna was the site for some early rounds of the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKreisky questioned [[Zionism]] as a solution to the problems faced by the Jewish people, claiming that Jews were not an ethnic group or race, but rather a religious group. He even equated claims of the existence of the Jewish people as a distinctive nationality to Nazi claims of a Jewish race, and suggested that such ideas raised questions about Jewish [[dual loyalty]]. However, he did not oppose the existence of [[Israel]] or question the legitimacy of Israeli patriotism, and developed friendly relations with the [[Israeli Labor Party]] and the [[Peace Now]] movement, though he harshly criticized the Israeli right-wing and the [[Likud]] party as fascists. Kreisky referred to Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] as a terrorist, and had a stormy relationship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] especially during the [[The Schoenau ultimatum|1973 hostage taking]]. He once said that he was \"the only politician in Europe Golda Meir can't blackmail.\" He cultivated friendly relations with Arab leaders such as [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and in 1980 Austria established relations with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestine Liberation Organisation]]. He tried to use his position as a European Jewish Socialist to act as a mediator between Israel and the Arabs.\n\nKreisky was notable for his allegedly apologetic approach to former [[Nazism|Nazi]] party members and contemporary far-right Austrian politicians. For example, Kreisky described [[right-wing populism|far-right populist]] [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] as \"a political talent worth watching\".<ref>{{cite web|title = The Death of a Right-Wing Populist|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|date = 13 October 2008|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,583790,00.html|accessdate = 29 November 2008}}</ref> Kreisky is alleged to have used coded anti-semitic language to attract right-wing voters in Austria{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In 1967, neo-Nazi Austrian leader Norbert Burger declared that he had no objections to Kreisky despite his Jewish background, claiming that he was simply a \"German\" and neither a religious Jew nor a Zionist. Kreisky felt that he had never personally suffered as a Jew, but only as a socialist. While imprisoned for his socialist activities during the Dollfuss regime, many of his cellmates were active Nazis, and Kreisky accepted them as fellow political opponents{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Following his election in 1970, Kreisky wanted to demonstrate that he was indeed \"Chancellor of all Austrians\", and appointed four politicians with [[Nazism|Nazi]] backgrounds to his cabinet. When Nazi hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] reported that four members of Kreisky's cabinet were former Nazis, Kreisky did not remove them from the government, though one did resign. Kreisky responded that everybody had the right to make political mistakes in their youth. This incident marked the beginning of a [[Kreisky-Peter-Wiesenthal affair|bitter conflict]], which did not end until Kreisky died. In 1986, Wiesenthal sued Kreisky for libel. Three years later the court found Kreisky guilty of defamation and forced him to pay a substantial fine.<ref>{{cite web |author=Minicy Catom Software Engineering Ltd. www.catom.com |url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=382&PID=0&IID=1595 |title=Austria's Attitude Toward Israel: Following the European Mainstream |publisher=Jcpa.org |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626063502/http://jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&TMID=111&LNGID=1&FID=382&PID=0&IID=1595 |archive-date=26 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Bruno Kreisky Foundation for Outstanding Achievements in the Area of Human Rights was founded to mark Kreisky's 65th birthday. Every two years, the [[Bruno Kreisky Award|Bruno Kreisky Human Rights Prize]] is awarded to an international figure who has advanced the cause of human rights.\n\nLater in his life Kreisky tried to help some [[Soviet dissidents]]. In particular, in 1983 he sent a letter to the Soviet premier [[Yuri Andropov]] demanding the release of dissident [[Yuri Orlov]], but Andropov left Kreisky's letter unanswered.<ref name=\"Bruno\">{{cite web|url=http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis80/lett83-1.pdf|title=Kreisky's letter along with Andropov's resolution on it|accessdate=17 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614130337/http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis80/lett83-1.pdf|archive-date=14 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nToday, Kreisky's premiership is the subject of both controversy and nostalgia. Many of his former supporters{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} see in Kreisky the last socialist of the old school and look back admiringly at an era when the standard of living was noticeably rising, when the [[welfare state]] was in full swing and when, by means of a state-funded programme promoting equality of opportunity, working class children were encouraged to stay on at school and eventually receive higher education. All this resulted in a decade of prosperity and optimism about the future.\n\nConservatives criticise Kreisky's policy of [[deficit spending]], expressed in his famous comment during the 1979 election campaign that he preferred that the state run up high debts rather than see people become unemployed.<ref>As quoted in Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice, \"I am less worried about the budget deficits than by the need for the state to create jobs where private industry fails.\"</ref> They hold Kreisky responsible for Austria's subsequent economic difficulties.

Aged 72 at the end of his chancellorship, he was the [[List of Austrian Chancellors by Longevity|oldest Chancellor]] after [[World War II]]. His 13-year tenure was the longest of any Chancellor in republican Austria.\n\n== Life and political career ==\nKreisky was born in [[Margareten]], a district of [[Vienna]], to a non-observant [[Jewish]] family. His parents were Max Kreisky (1876, [[Klatovy]] \u2013 1944)<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Max-Kreisky/6000000007320495732]</ref> and Irene Felix Kreisky n\u00e9e Felix (1884, [[T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]] \u2013 1969).<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Irene-Kreisky/6000000008800422390]</ref> His father worked as a textile manufacturer.<ref name=\"weininternational\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wieninternational.at/en/content/100th-anniversary-birth-bruno-kreisky-en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401140842/http://www.wieninternational.at/en/content/100th-anniversary-birth-bruno-kreisky-en |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} 100th anniversary of the birth of Bruno Kreisky, 11 January 2011{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Shocked by the level of poverty and violence in Austria during the 1920s, he joined the youth wing of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) in 1925 at age 15. In 1927, he joined the Young Socialist Workers against the wishes of his parents. In 1929, he began studying law at the [[University of Vienna]] at the advice of [[Otto Bauer]], who urged him to study law rather than medicine, as he had originally planned. He remained politically active during this period. In 1931, he left the Jewish religious community, becoming agnostic.<ref name=\"weininternational\"/> In 1934, when the Socialist Party was banned by the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Dollfuss]] dictatorship, he became active in underground political work. He was arrested in January 1935 and convicted of [[high treason]], but was released in June 1936. In March 1938 the Austrian state was incorporated into Germany through the ''[[Anschluss]]'', and in September Kreisky escaped the Nazi persecution of Austrian Jews and the coming [[Holocaust]] by emigrating to [[Sweden]], where he remained until 1945. On 23 April 1942, he married Vera F\u00fcrth (30 December 1916 \u2013 5 December 1988).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/wiki/index.php?title=Bruno_Kreisky&printable=yes |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211190056/https://www.wien.gv.at/wiki/index.php?title=Bruno_Kreisky&printable=yes |archive-date=11 February 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and had one son and one daughter.\n\nHe returned to Austria in May 1946, but he was soon back in [[Stockholm]], assigned to the Austrian legation. In 1951 he returned to Vienna, where Federal President [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (Austrian president)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]] appointed him Assistant Chief of Staff and political adviser. In 1953 he was appointed Undersecretary in the Foreign Affairs Department of the Austrian Chancellery. In this position he took part in negotiating the 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]], which ended the four-power occupation of Austria and restored Austria's independence and neutrality.\n\nKreisky was elected to the Austrian parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]] as a Socialist during the [[1956 Austrian legislative election|1956 election]]. He was elected to the Party Executive along with [[Bruno Pittermann]], Felix Slavik, and [[Franz Olah]], and thus became a member of the central leadership body of the party. After the [[1959 Austrian legislative election|1959 election]], he became Foreign Minister in the [[coalition]] cabinet of Chancellor [[Julius Raab]] ([[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]]), a post he continued to hold under Raab's successors [[Alfons Gorbach]] (1961\u20131964) and [[Josef Klaus]] (1964\u20131966). He played a leading role in setting up the [[European Free Trade Association]], helped solve the [[South Tyrol]] question with Italy, and proposed a \"[[Marshall Plan]]\" for the countries of the [[Third World]].\n\nIn 1966, the \u00d6VP under Klaus won an absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Although Klaus could have governed alone, memories of the hyperpartisanship that characterized the First Republic were still very strong, and he wanted to continue the grand coalition that had governed since 1945. However, talks between Klaus and Kreisky broke down. Kreisky resigned from cabinet, and the \u00d6VP formed the first one-party government of the Second Republic. However, the Socialists were not completely shut out of power; they were informally consulted on all major decisions.\n\nIn February 1967, Kreisky was elected chairman of the Socialist Party. At the [[1970 Austrian legislative election|March 1970 elections]], the Socialists won 81 seats, two short of a majority. Kreisky became the first Socialist Chancellor since 1920, heading the first purely left-wing government in modern Austrian history. He was also Austria's first Jewish Chancellor. Kreisky's government was tolerated by the then national-liberals [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in return for electoral reforms that were intended to give smaller parties a greater voice. Following the passage of these reforms, he called fresh elections in [[1971 Austrian legislative election|October 1971]]. At these elections, the Socialists won a sweeping victory, winning a strong majority government with 93 seats. They also won half the popular vote, something no Austrian party had ever achieved in a free election. Kreisky was reelected in [[1975 Austrian legislative election|1975]] and [[1979 Austrian legislative election|1979 elections]], each time winning comfortable majorities in the Nationalrat.\n\nKreisky turned 70 in 1981, and by this time the voters had become increasingly uncomfortable with what they saw as his complacency and preoccupation with international issues. At the [[1983 Austrian legislative election|1983 election]], the Socialists lost their absolute majority in the Nationalrat. Kreisky declined to form a minority government and resigned, nominating [[Fred Sinowatz]], his Minister of Education, as his successor. His health was declining, and in 1984 he had an emergency [[kidney]] [[organ transplant|transplant]]. During his final years he occasionally made bitter remarks directed at his party, who had made him their honorary chairman. He died in Vienna in July 1990.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/obituaries/bruno-kreisky-austria-s-leader-for-a-record-13-years-dies-at-79.html</ref>\n\n== Political views and programs ==\n[[File:Kreisky (left) with Fateh 1962.jpg|right|thumb|Kreisky (left) with [[Abul Fateh]] in Vienna, 1962.]]\nIn office, Kreisky and his close ally, Justice Minister [[Christian Broda]], pursued a policy of liberal reform, in a country which had a tradition of conservative [[Roman Catholicism]]. He reformed Austria's family law and its prisons, and he decriminalised abortion and homosexuality. Nevertheless, he sought to bridge the gap between the Catholic Church and the Austrian Socialist movement and found a willing collaborator in the then Cardinal [[Archbishop of Vienna]], [[Franz K\u00f6nig]]. Kreisky promised to reduce the mandatory military service from nine to six months. After his election, military service was reduced to eight months (if performed in one stretch, or six months plus eight weeks if broken into two segments).\n\nDuring Kreisky's premiership, a wide range of progressive reforms was carried out.<ref>https://www.sozialversicherung.at/portal27/sec/portal/esv_enportal/content/contentWindow?contentid=10007.687468&action=2{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Amongst other reforms, employee benefits were expanded, the workweek was cut to 40 hours, and legislation providing for equality for women was passed. Kreisky's government established language rights for the country's [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croats|Croatian]] minorities. Following the [[1973 oil crisis|1974 oil shock]], Kreisky committed Austria to developing [[nuclear power]] to reduce dependence on oil, although this policy was eventually abandoned after a [[referendum]] held in 1978. A moderate reform of the penal code was carried out, discrimination against illegitimate children was eliminated, marriage grants were introduced, mother-child pass (a pre-natal/post-natal care and infant health program) was established, a major reform of the penal code was carried out, and sex equality legislation was passed. In addition, four weeks of annual vacation were introduced, the office of ombudsman was established, the law of parentage was reordered, consumer protection legislation was passed, and social security coverage of the self-employed was introduced.<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=1371 Austria under Social Democratic Rule: The Kreisky Years], H-net.org</ref> In 1979, restrictions on redundancy and the dismissal of employees were made.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HmNpl0wNa8AC&pg=PA513&dq=bruno+kreisky+social+insurance+1976&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=bruno%20kreisky%20social%20insurance%201976&f=false Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, Volume 1], edited by A.

In 1978, due to a change from tax allowances to direct payments for children, family benefits increased significantly. Between 1973 and 1980, expenditure on health and education rose on average by 13.7% and by 12.9% per annum respectively. In education, pupil/teacher ratios fell sharply and a new university law was passed in 1975 in order to make higher education more democratic.<ref>Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice</ref> The educational sector was significantly expanded under Kreisky, greatly increasing the numbers of Austrians receiving a university education.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B8iJNlWcdIUC&pg=PA263&dq=bruno+kreisky+free+university+education&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mgDzUZTvF-Sr0gWimYC4Aw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=bruno%20kreisky%20free%20university%20education&f=false Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe: A Biographical Dictionary], David Wilsford, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p. 263 (at Google Books)</ref>\n\nThe 1972 Crime Victims Act established the principles of compensation for health damages caused (directly or indirectly) by crimes punishable by more than 6 months' imprisonment. The 1974 Town Renovation Act dealt with the renovation of residential town areas, while the 1975 Housing Property Act established the property rights of house- and flat-owners. In 1975, housing supplements were extended to cover costs of housing improvements. In 1974, the work prohibiting periods before and after work birth were extended up to 8 weeks, and in 1976 the regulations were extended to adoptive mothers. A 1981 law adapted pension schemes to changes in the families' loads equalisation scheme, and introduced a widowers' pension equivalent to the widows' pension.

Although the 1955 State Treaty prevented Austria from joining the [[European Union]], he supported European integration. Austria cast itself as a bridge between East and West, and Vienna was the site for some early rounds of the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKreisky questioned [[Zionism]] as a solution to the problems faced by the Jewish people, claiming that Jews were not an ethnic group or race, but rather a religious group. He even equated claims of the existence of the Jewish people as a distinctive nationality to Nazi claims of a Jewish race, and suggested that such ideas raised questions about Jewish [[dual loyalty]]. However, he did not oppose the existence of [[Israel]] or question the legitimacy of Israeli patriotism, and developed friendly relations with the [[Israeli Labor Party]] and the [[Peace Now]] movement, though he harshly criticized the Israeli right wing and the [[Likud]] party as fascists. Kreisky referred to Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] as a terrorist, and had a stormy relationship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] especially during the [[The Schoenau ultimatum|1973 hostage taking]]. He once said that he was \"the only politician in Europe Golda Meir can't blackmail.\" He cultivated friendly relations with Arab leaders such as [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and in 1980 Austria established relations with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestine Liberation Organisation]]. He tried to use his position as a European Jewish Socialist to act as a mediator between Israel and the Arabs.\n\nKreisky was notable for his allegedly apologetic approach to former [[Nazism|Nazi]] party members and contemporary far-right Austrian politicians. For example, Kreisky described [[right-wing populism|far-right populist]] [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] as \"a political talent worth watching\".<ref>{{cite web|title = The Death of a Right-Wing Populist|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|date = 13 October 2008|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,583790,00.html|accessdate = 29 November 2008}}</ref> Kreisky is alleged to have used coded anti-semitic language to attract right-wing voters in Austria{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In 1967, neo-Nazi Austrian leader Norbert Burger declared that he had no objections to Kreisky despite his Jewish background, claiming that he was simply a \"German\" and neither a religious Jew nor a Zionist. Kreisky felt that he had never personally suffered as a Jew, but only as a socialist. While imprisoned for his socialist activities during the Dollfuss regime, many of his cellmates were active Nazis, and Kreisky accepted them as fellow political opponents{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Following his election in 1970, Kreisky wanted to demonstrate that he was indeed \"Chancellor of all Austrians\", and appointed four politicians with [[Nazism|Nazi]] backgrounds to his cabinet. When Nazi hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] reported that four members of Kreisky's cabinet were former Nazis, Kreisky did not remove them from the government, though one did resign. Kreisky responded that everybody had the right to make political mistakes in their youth. This incident marked the beginning of a [[Kreisky-Peter-Wiesenthal affair|bitter conflict]], which did not end until Kreisky died. In 1986, Wiesenthal sued Kreisky for libel. Three years later the court found Kreisky guilty of defamation and forced him to pay a substantial fine.<ref>{{cite web |author=Minicy Catom Software Engineering Ltd. www.catom.com |url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=382&PID=0&IID=1595 |title=Austria's Attitude Toward Israel: Following the European Mainstream |publisher=Jcpa.org |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626063502/http://jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&TMID=111&LNGID=1&FID=382&PID=0&IID=1595 |archive-date=26 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Bruno Kreisky Foundation for Outstanding Achievements in the Area of Human Rights was founded to mark Kreisky's 65th birthday. Every two years, the [[Bruno Kreisky Award|Bruno Kreisky Human Rights Prize]] is awarded to an international figure who has advanced the cause of human rights.\n\nLater in his life Kreisky tried to help some [[Soviet dissidents]]. In particular, in 1983 he sent a letter to the Soviet premier [[Yuri Andropov]] demanding the release of dissident [[Yuri Orlov]], but Andropov left Kreisky's letter unanswered.<ref name=\"Bruno\">{{cite web|url=http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis80/lett83-1.pdf|title=Kreisky's letter along with Andropov's resolution on it|accessdate=17 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614130337/http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/pdfs/dis80/lett83-1.pdf|archive-date=14 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nToday, Kreisky's premiership is the subject of both controversy and nostalgia. Many of his former supporters{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} see in Kreisky the last socialist of the old school and look back admiringly at an era when the standard of living was noticeably rising, when the [[welfare state]] was in full swing and when, by means of a state-funded programme promoting equality of opportunity, working class children were encouraged to stay on at school and eventually receive higher education. All this resulted in a decade of prosperity and optimism about the future.\n\nConservatives criticise Kreisky's policy of [[deficit spending]], expressed in his famous comment during the 1979 election campaign that he preferred that the state run up high debts rather than see people become unemployed.<ref>As quoted in Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice, \"I am less worried about the budget deficits than by the need for the state to create jobs where private industry fails.\"</ref> They hold Kreisky responsible for Austria's subsequent economic difficulties. Despite this criticism, Kreisky did much to transform Austria during his time in office, with considerable improvements in working conditions, a dramatic rise in the average standard of living,<ref>\"Austria\", Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae Encyclopedia 2001. \u00a9 1993\u20132000 Microsoft Corporation.
